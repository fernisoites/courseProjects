S'Ah, Ninjew, we feel the same.\n\nWait! Nin*jew?*\n\n(Do you stalk victims with the cunning stealth of Woody Allen? Do your enemies live in clenched apprehension of being hit with a six-pointed Chinese throwing Star-of-David?)\n\nSorry. I was sidetracked by hilarious images of Bernie Sanders taking on his opponents by dropping into a Ninja stance and making high-pitched karate noises.\n\n'
p65
aS"I mean I suppose we'll find out. I just have never seen the same level of energy or support behind Sanders that Obama had after he was elected to the Senate.\n\nSanders reminds me more of a Kucinich."
p66
aS"But they agree on the most pressing issues which are the ones I'm most concerned about. Anti-lobbying, the drug war, and getting rid of US involvement overseas. \n\nAlso Sanders wants a more centralized education system?"

p71
aS'Okay, so confirmed: You don\'t know anything about socialism.\n\nThe "National Socialist German Workers party", aka Nazi\'s, were an anti-socialist movement.  They decided to brand their philosophy as "national socialism", which was basically the opposite of it, but sounded good for the climate of the time.\n\nThey were right-wing and conservative and believed very strongly in property rights.  \n\n&gt; The former Soviet Union, that\'s another great example of socialism.\n\nRight, and the Soviet Union is socialist.  You failed to actually define socialism here.\n\nThe Soviet Union was against property rights, against capitalism, and the government was supposed to give out wages.\n\n\nHillary Clinton and Barack Obama are certainly not any of these.\n\n\nNow, Bernie Sanders is basically in line with modern European Socialist parties, but modern European Socialism (like you have in the UK) is very very *very* different from classic socialism.\n\nObama would be centrist or right wing in Europe.  Right wing groups in Europe push for private healthcare mandates, left wing push for single payer.'
p72
aS"Bernie Sanders is a conspiratard. The idea that a few wealthy oligarchs control the government is just bunk nonsense. Everyone lobbies for their interest on both sides and then the decisions are made via the democratic process. We elect our leaders because we trust them to act on our behalf. Bernie Sanders just wants to stir drama over nonissues to get attention for his campaign. Bernie is an old kook who wants to punish America's large corporations for no crime other than being successful. If large corporations are not successful what does Sanders think will happen to the economy? He needs to retire and make way for Hillary, she's obviously the better choice to grow America's economy and spread our influence abroad by allowing easier access to foreign markets.  The TPP is the best way of achieving that and Hillary knows it. Bernie needs to stop with these crackpot arguments. "

aS'No, what Bernie Sanders is proposing is reasonable and makes Hillary Clinton look like just another tired old politician with nothing to offer. '

aS"Or it's because Bernie Sanders wants to ban the most popular rifle in the country . . . which he does.  Bernie Sanders even voted for this ban as recently as 2013.\n\nWhat grade would you expect NARAL to give a politician who wanted a criminal ban on the most popular form of abortion?\n\nThe NRA will give Democrats As.  Mark Begich (D-Alaska) even had an A- after voting in support of what the NRA considered anti-gun judges (he had an A prior to that).\n\nThe problem is that most Democrats are going to get a lower grade because their party decided to put a ban on the most popular rifle in the US in their party platform, so simply by being a Democrat your default position is endorsing that (fairly extreme) prohibition."
p82
aS'Except there is a cost to this sometimes. For years the Democrats kept putting who they wanted to up for election, regardless of elect-ability. The result was CRUSHING DEFEATS except for the Watergate inspired single term of Carter. Here\'s some electoral vote numbers:\n\n - 1968: Nixon 301, Humphrey 191, Wallace 46\n - 1972: Nixon 520, McGovern 17 (McGovern won a SINGLE STATE and DC.)\n - 1976: Carter 297, Ford (the guy who pardoned Nixon) 240. \n - 1980: Reagan 489, Carter 49\n - 1984: Reagan 525, Mondale 13\n - 1988: Bush 426, Dukakis 111\n\nAnd then, for the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat was elected twice as as president: William J. Clinton. \n\nSo yes, I get it, all you idealists can\'t stand us moderate, pro business, pro gun, culture war wishy washy Democrats. But at least our candidates don\'t get obliterated. All those liberals that kept winning the nomination, just allowed a Republican to have a super mandate to do what they want. It\'s time to be a grown up, and realize that if you want Bernie Sanders (or someone like him) to be president, you have to first convince the country to agree with his stances LONG LONG before it\'s election time. It\'s like showing up the day of the final exam saying "if we just study hard enough in the next 15 minutes, we might pass." No...you won\'t. '
p83
aS'And constituents aren\'t always voters.  And voters aren\'t always people who voted for that candidate.\n\nIs it really that difficult to parse this out and say "huh, it\'s probably true that Bernie Sanders isn\'t responsive to the most conservative voters in Vermont"?\n\nBecause last I checked, that person would also be a constituent.'

aS"It's expected for unions to donate to campaigns though. The fact that they chose Sanders makes me feel good about how his policies are for workers. And I don't really expect individual people to donate enough to be listed as a top contributor, especially if they belong to unions that are already donating. \n\nThat being said, I'd be far happier if there were rules that unions couldn't use regular dues to contribute to a political campaign. If they wanted to take up an optional collection that would be fine. But when unions use members' dues to support a political campaign, it lends weight to the argument for right-to-work legislation, which undermines unions and thus reduces workers' power. "
p88
aS'It\'s true!\n\nBut we\'re not a direct democracy, we\'re a representative democracy.  So while a majority rules the *election*, and a majority of legislators rules a given piece of legislation, the majority of constituents does not and should not "rule" that legislator\'s vote on any specific issue.  It *can*, but there\'s no obligation.\n\nBut that\'s also not the point.  Your note was that "constituents" and "supporters" aren\'t the same group, and your argument was that it\'s wrong to be responsive to supporters but not constituents.  But Bernie Sanders is responsive to supporters (people who voted for him and don\'t generally disagree with him on every issue) not just to constituents.\n\nSo let\'s bring it all together:\n\nIf a majority of voters in Vermont opposed raising taxes on the wealthy, do you think Bernie Sanders should change his mind?  What if the majority opposed campaign finance reform?'

There\'s a whole spectrum of options between "nothing" and "whatever Sanders believes in, but I have no idea what that is."\n\n&gt;The opposition gives no fucks about that issue. Sanders is putting a spotlight on it.\n\nYou seem to have mistaken my point for "I\'m a Republican."\n\nI\'m not.  I\'m a registered Democrat and have been for my entire adult life.\n\nWhat I\'m reacting to is the constant circle-jerk of how awesome Sanders\' *plans* are.  I haven\'t seen a single plan.  I\'ve seen rhetoric, I\'ve seen broad goals, I haven\'t seen a *plan*.\n\nAnd speaking as someone with a background in public policy, the plan is the important part.\n\nBecause *no one* disagrees with a statement like "we need to make college affordable."\n\nThe disagreement is over *how* we do that.'

You can think Sanders is the best candidate and checks off all your requirements, but he'll never win a general election. And if he's the nominee, or somehow weakens Clinton in the general election then a Republican could win and the country will suffer, that's just a fact.\n\n And if you seriously think Clinton or Obama aren't Democrats then I'm not going to argue with you. You're just wrong.\n\nThat being said, I think Sanders is way too smart to not see the bigger picture here and I don't anticipate it being an issue. "

aS'&gt; The reality is that Bernie can\'t win, no matter how corrupt Hillary may or may not be. She is the one with the major financing and thats it.\n\nSee, herein lies the problem. Everyone repeating this crap. You get into a mindset of he can\'t win so we can\'t support him.\n\nIf he can beat Hillary he can wipe the floor with Jeb Bush. You can vote for him in the primaries without it being a spoiler. You can work hard to help him win the primary. If he can win the primary he can win the GE.\n\nThe other day someone linked a study that showed doubling the budget of a campaign only affects 1% of voters. So if he can only get together 1/4 the budget of Jeb or Hillary he needs to get over a 2% disadvantage. With his debating skills, his conscientious voting record and lack of stains in his past I absolutely believe he can do this.\n\nThe only way to break out of the chicken and egg problem is to force him in. Precedent will then make people more  willing to support other "underdogs" that they feel are "the right person" but that "don\'t have a chance".\n\nSanders has already done the unprecedented. He got voted into the house and senate as an independent, and has always been able to vote his consciousness.\n\nSaying he can\'t win is just giving up, taking the easy way out.'

I know he isn't as likely to win as Clinton, but if enough people get involved, you never know. "
p105
aS"Anyone who has ever done anything had to start somewhere. And Sanders has been a mayor, a representative, and a senator for many years. He is familiar with Washington. He has been contemplating and planning this campaign for at least a year prior to announcing his bid. You act as if we are trying to elect a crusty old bum as POTUS.  \n\nThe reason I'm tired of reading your comments is not because they differ from mine, it's because they are extremely defeatist in nature and very repetitive. "
p106
aS'&gt; While Democrats are generally excited about the entry of a new candidate into the primary, when asked if Sanders could actually win their states caucus or primary, 93 percent of Democrats said no. \n\n\nTough to win the Democratic nomination if Democrats aren\'t behind you.\n\n\nThis may have something to do with the fact that Bernie is not in fact a Democrat.  Oh, he\'s certainly progressive, but he\'s run **from** the party that he\'s now seeking to nominate him for President.\n\n\nNow I realize that this sub has become for all intents and purposes the "Run, Bernie, Run!" cheer squad, but perhaps one of the devoted true believers can take time out of upvoting every "Bernie Sanders is Awesome" post to explain exactly how he can possibly win the nomination of a party that he\'s rejected, and that really doesn\'t want him as anything other than a foil for an actual Democrat?\n\n\nI\'ll wait.'
p107
aS"I think it's better explained by the two-axis political spectrum. Republicans and democrats are well separated left and right by economic and social policy, but both are distinctly authoritarian. Paul and Sanders are running under different parties and have different worldviews, but are both a good deal more libertarian than their parties' mainstream."
p108
aS"Come on, all the candidates do it. I'm not trying to say politics isn't corrupt, but the only people not doing what Clinton does are people with no shot of winning. Bernie Sanders isn't going to win a single state come primary time.\n\nAlso, Obama made some pretty big screw ups foreign policy wise but I would vote for him again. He closed Guantanamo Bay, pulled out of Afghanistan, established socialized healthcare, created the stimulus package, ended to Cuba embargo, etc etc."
p109
aS"Bernie Sanders isn't going to win because of defeatist attitudes like yours.\n\nDo you believe in what he's saying? Do you believe he is worthy of your trust? Then follow him in the primaries, help get the word out. Worst thing that could happen? Clinton wins the primaries. On the long shot that Bernie wins the primaries, there  is no reason why he couldn't win the General election. Clinton is a far bigger obstacle than Jeb Bush could ever be. Bernie is not part of a political dynasty. Even if for  the sake of the elections he's running as a democrat(so as not to have a spoiler effect in the GE), he is an independent and independent voters can actually get behind him. He just needs more coverage.\n\nIf you want to get out of this shitfest, stop being part of the problem."
p110
aS'&gt;Generally political scientists and other commentators will define terminology based on their broad use across the developed world.\n\nI think that largely depends on the context of the discussion. In this case, this thread is largely debating whether Sanders should be considered "Far Left" or "Center Left" or "Moderate." So while you can absolutely make a comparison to the political leanings of other developed democracies, the concluding point should be where Sanders falls on the US spectrum.\n\nHe is running for President in the US and therefore how he would be perceived by the European electorate doesn\'t really matter here. It\'d be the same as saying that all French politicians are radically Left when compared to the US. Is it true? Sure, but the US doesn\'t elect French politicians so the discussion itself is limiting in necessity.\n\nIt\'s be just like comparing Sanders to the leanings of Bismarck in the 1880s. Interesting? Sure. But ultimately a discussion not really relevant to the context of Sanders running.'

aS'Not only was Clinton polling better when he announced compared to Sanders today, he was also running less than six points behind the front runner.

Someone like Kasich is much more similar to the Clinton formula.'

The only thing I\'m interested in hearing is "what\'s your ground-game strategy look like?"'

aS'They are low-key undermining his campaign. They are trying to stop it before it gains momentum by deflecting the conversation away from his campaign, repeating "he doesn\'t have a chance" over and over until enough people begin to believe it and it becomes the narrative of his campaign. This is how it starts. \n\nIf he gains more momentum, it will devolve into cheap shots, avoiding covering anything of substance, and petty character assassination in one form or another. There will be an obvious void of articles and segments covering him and his supporters in a positive light; the Hillary (D) vs. ______ (R) narrative will be pushed hard. \n\nThe owners of the media do have agendas, and have used them to push narratives countless times. It\'s not in their interests to have someone with ideals like Bernie Sanders calling the shots, and it is not in our interest to sit back and let them control the national conversation. That is why it is imperative that we take part in a grassroots campaign to inform people, bolster support for his campaign, and achieve a high turnout at the primaries/caucuses, and the 2016 election. \n\n'

Realistically speaking, Senator Sanders is going to be spending other people's money on a campaign that was doomed before it began. "
p125
aS'Bernie Sanders is a moderate leftist. That is all. We have had moderate leftists in the past who won elections based off of sweeping rhetoric all based upon deception.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Capitalism is global, and it is relentless. The State operates as a functionary of the will of the capitalist class. Washington is entirely beholden to this class - at times they will be far-sighted and throw behind "leftist" politicians during times of dissent and unrest so they can ride out the storm.\n\nAs soon as the storm subsides, they bring back their heavy hitters (Reagan, Bush, etc).\n\nIf you think that political action stops at voting for Bernie Sanders, you are dreadfully mistaken. The Democratic Party wants you to stop at voting for their chess piece. \n\nTo quote Mao Zedong, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun". Unless Americans declare a war against capitalism and the exploitation of the working class around the world, and the Western imperialism which exploits the 3rd world\'s labor for its own, then progressive society will never be realized.\n\nWe must be militantly anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, and against the private ownership of the means of production. Anything less will result in an indefinite quagmire of confusion and reactionary behavior.'

Obama is a moderate who\'s "too far left" for almost half the country, and Sanders is open about being a democratic socialist.  \n\nThe two candidates that make it to the general election are usually the most bought-out, platitudinous milquetoasts that their parties can offer.  Sanders has beliefs and he stands up for them.   That\'s why I feel like most Democratic voters will pass on him in the primaries. '

p129
aS"That's not the whole picture. The progressive movement in the US could be traced back to the transcendentalist movement, which was unitarian, not Christian. Henry David Thoreau wrote *Resistance to Civil Government* (which was a major influence to both Gandhi and Rev. King) eleven years before Bryan was born. \n\nAfter the civil war, transcendentalism faded away and the labor rights movement took off. Christian socialists played a roll, for sure, but there is no denying the roll of a blatantly irreligious socialist movement in the United States. And it was extraordinarily popular. Bryan may have been a dominant political figure in Washington, but the Socialist Party of America, led by Eugene V. Debs, played a significant roll in bringing about progressive reforms through direct action and local electoral politics. Debs received 6% of the popular vote in the 1912 Presidential election, and 3% in 1920... when he was serving a ten year sentence in prison for sedition because he called on the American people to refuse to fight in WWI. Woodrow Wilson certainly thought Debs was more of a threat to traditional politics than Bryan.\n\nUltimately, the progressive reforms of the early twentieth century arose from the actions of the people, tirelessly struggling against the status quo, demanding that their needs be met and that economic policy reflect the moral principles that all decent men and women value. \n\nSanders is not a savior. There is no such thing. At most, he is a public figure that is useful to the ends of the people. He will only be useful towards those ends if we push him to do as we will."

Bryan was an influence on Debs (before Bryan lost his mind and went 100% social conservative) and a cog in the system.  I\'m not claiming Sanders is the "second coming."  I\'m saying that he could be a sentence in a history book right before the chapter on social reform.  We have to stop acting as if Sanders HAS TO BE PRESIDENT before we have social progress; support for Sanders is just one, small step.  That is what I mean when I say that Sanders can be the Bill Bryan of the 21st century.'

Gee I wonder why?  Nobody wants to spend all day cleaning up cow shit and baling hay for minimum wage (or less)?  How about we let American workers bargain for what they feel is a fair price for their labor and let whatever that price is be reflected in the cost of milk?  And then put tariffs on imported dairy to protect those jobs?  I would be honored to pay $10 for a gallon of milk if it supported a working class American family.  And I would be honored to help working class American families buy milk if they can no longer afford it.  I would be happy to have Scandinavia\'s social policies if we also had their immigration policy.  I imagine that I\'d be deported pretty quickly if I tried to live and work in Norway. '

aS"I think Bernie Sanders is really interesting. My current concern is that unions have been large contributors to his campaign in the past, which are just another special interest these days. He's strongly opposing the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, which is probably the right thing to do, considering some of its more nefarious details, but free-trade itself is good for everyone in the long term. I wish there was more discussion about that, and not just the bad parts that stand to benefit the wealthy elite."

aS"I concur. /u/fafoah 's post should be at the top. I too felt compelled to believe Bernie Sanders is the guy I should be supporting, simply based on watching that recent campaign video of his and things like this. I too also pushed aside that compelling force and knew to do more research on this guy before making any serious judgement.  I think a healthy dose of skepticism is what Reddit actually trains people to have. Like many places on the internet, Reddit also has a lot of BS, but one of the reasons I feel more compelled to follow this crowd over others is because the people on here, overall, seem more cynical and skeptical than most. We tend to fact check, and the comments section is basically our go to. Hell, I haven't even clicked the OP yet."

That\'s why I pointed out that the reasons people are saying he\'s unelectable are vastly different than the reasons people were saying Obama is unelectable.\n\nDismissing people who say Sanders is unelectable, without listening to their reasoning, is just as foolish as dismissing him without listening to the other side\'s reasoning. I think he\'s an interesting candidate. I\'m not sure he could win a general election, but I won\'t count him out until we get some debates out of the way. That being said, there are good reasons to be skecptical of his viability, for exactly the reasons that people on Reddit seem to love him.

The boomers are going to screw you and leave you with a huge bill.   Sanders is totally on board with this.  \n\nYour generation needs to stop seeing 50% of federal dollars going to the elderly.  There is no money left to invest in the future.  A society become great when an old man plants a tree whose shade he knows he will never sit under.

This is completely different from saying he won\'t launch a super PAC. Great title CNN. Way to obfuscate the truth about while promoting misunderstandings of what super PACs are and what they\'re allowed to do.'

I am just using Ryan as he is popular among most conservatives and even many independents (according to voting). Edit: also, his district doesn't look very gerrymandered\n\nSanders has a very large and dedicated following, but let's not pretend like he connects to country-wide public opinion on that level.  Sanders supporters have every right to be excited and be proud of their candidate but many need to look at it his chances and popularity on a much larger stage, something he has little experience being in.

I think people expect the president to be able to completely change all of society on his/her own, but there's a whole congress that's largely Republican, and will likely remain so for a very long time due to how midterms/gerrymandering work. And, there's no shortage of corporations ready to line any politician's pockets. Bernie Sanders said in an interview that he believed Obama's heart was a lot more genuine than the results he got, because he spent too much time in the beginning thinking he could compromise with Republicans, who were absolutely determined to ensure his presidency was a failure. He's said he wouldn't make the same mistake. He's used to having rich enemies, and defeating rich enemiesit would be interesting to see what kind of traction he could get in the white house.\n\nOh, and yes goddamnit, young people if you fucking care, vote for Bernie in the primaries!

aS'&gt;You\'re tying "real politicians" to "accepting money from billionaires." Lovely.\n\nNot only billionaires donate to PACs. I have donated to a PAC of my choice in the past. My money gets lumped in with those who do better than I do, but that doesn\'t mean that the money is some how "tainted" or less important.\n\n&gt;I haven\'t made a valid point?\n\nNope.\n\n&gt;Sanders won VT as an independent vs an incredibly wealthy candidate, on the financing of individual donations.\n\nThe political landscape of a state with 600,000 people vs. trying to win a Democratic presidential candidacy in 50 states is a hugely different scenario. If you can\'t see this, then God help you. It\'s one man and a bunch of microdonations vs. people with the resources to actually make that happen.\n\n&gt;What do you think he could do with the backing of the Democratic party?\n\nWhat exactly do you mean when you say "the backing of the Democratic party?" Party backing means financial backing - and some of that money comes from the "billionaires" you speak of, which then leaves your candidate with two options:\n\n* Lose the election because you\'re not going to accept money from the DNC  and it\'s PACs\n\n* Take the money, have a legitimate chance at the presidency, but become a hypocrite in the process.

I am extremely glad someone of his caliber has stepped up to challenge and hopefully deter another Clinton. The last thing I wanted to see for this country was another Bush vs. Clinton election. We need to get them, their relatives, cousins and friends all out of D.C. Snakes in the fucking grass, if you ask me.\n\nBut, how do we ensure that Bernie will not get corrupt once elected? Similar to the path that Obama has taken. At first Obama was quite trustable and for the people and real change, but once in power, things seem to change very quickly.\n"

aS"Voting records. It shows what kind of candidate they actually are. That's why Sanders is basically being worshiped. People who lean left who are into politics have known about Sanders for years. He's a favorite because, even though he's done some typical politician BS, he's far better than most candidates. Hilary votes like a right winger, Cruz is a nutjob, Bush is a Bush. Sanders is the only sane politician in the running. He actually votes to help Americans rather than giant corporations. "

aS"First of all, Obama can't do everything, because he's limited by his presidential powers. Also, while he was inspiring, I don't recall him claiming to be very liberal. Sanders has been consistently in support of same-sex marriage, where Obama was not. Obama had to play politics, and Sanders hasn't really been. Being jaded is somewhat warranted, but please vote for him in the primaries if he aligns with your beliefs!"
p198
aS'The fact alone that he unashamedly had socialistic ideas. Identifies a bit socialist etc. That will be one of his biggest hurdles right there. So many people could not actually tell you what socialism is if their life depended on it. Just that it is bad and what Russia used. Both of which would be wrong. \n\nFurthermore Obama came in after 8 years of bush II. People were ready for a massive change. Which Obama promised. And won on. But in many ways. Some of which were out of his control he failed. There is and will be a lot of apathy to overcome this time. If anything the momentum will be on the Republican side. Though they do a pretty good job of keeping their voters constantly whipped up over imaginary boogy men.\n\nSanders stands very little chance. Though he has  my vote in the primary for sure.

aS"This isn't true at all, but feel free to make that argument.  Completely false statement.\n\nEdit:  In case anyone is wondering, Obama was doing better in the polls than Sanders, versus an opponent that was doing worse in the polls than HRC today, had raised more money, and had earned more public endorsements by fellow Democrats (as far as I know Sanders has none whereas HRC is breaking records).  There is literally no argument that Obama had less of a chance during his first run.  Grassroots groundswell is great, but Obama had that to go with the necessary resources and the backing of establishment Democrats who sway opinion within the party, whereas Bernie Sanders only has the first.  I like Sanders politics better than even candidate Obama's politics (as opposed to the even more moderate POTUS Obama's politics) but making false statement just make his supporters seem loony, a narrative that was used against Ron Paul in 2012 in order to push moderate voters away from him.  If supporters of Sanders want his campaign to be taken seriously, we should admit that it will take an historical run in the primary to win and therefor everyone needs to help him for there to be even a chance.  Not that there is anything wrong with being the Ron Paul of the Democrats given that Paul definitely introduced some Libertarian ideas into the mainstream GOP (even if it tends to be lip service), but if you want to see him win please don't make obviously wrong statements when it just makes neutral viewers become turned off from his campaign."
p202
aS"But as the article points out, Sanders is going to have an especially hard time if he refuses to criticize Clinton on issues of substance.  Clinton is talking a populist game, but she has received millions in contributions and personal income from the institutions that Sanders is trying to fight.  And in light of her disconcerting professional opacity, it's not hitting below the belt to question her sincerity.  If Clinton wants our support, she should be seeking ways to demonstrate a genuine opposition to the interests of Wall Street firms and multinational corporations that will carry through her campaign into her governance.

aS"No, It's Bernie Sanders saying that he won't do something that no other candidate is doing either. A Super PAC is a group that gets together for a political reason and to campaign for their preferred policy, candidate etc. But these groups are completely and totally unaffiliated with any candidate they are promoting, and are doing so without that candidate's approval or disapproval. One of the things they do is sponsor commercials that say candidate X is good, or candidate Y is bad so you should vote for candidate X, but candidate X was never contacted by the group that made the commercial. \n\n&gt; Is it basically bribery like the rest of American politics?\n\nI take issue with this statement, but first I will say it is not bribery for the reasons I listed above. It is in fact illegal for any candidate to be affiliated with a Super PAC, so Bernie Sanders is just pandering to people who don't know how Super PACs work. Now, as for the rest of American politics, there is actually very little bribery in our political system. People just tend to take the above example, see that someone is paying money to support a candidate, and call that bribery. "

The crony-capitalist needs the state to be strong so that it can illegally extract wealth from the citizens [which will then be funneled through to the crony-capitalist class]. \n\nBut the answer is not to get rid of capitalism. Capitalism will always exist. It always has.\n\nPeople will always trade and barter. If one guy has a silver coin and another guy has a sack of grain; and the one wants the silver coin more than the sack of grain (and, likewise, where the other wants the sack of grain more than the silver coin), they trade. Both parties are happy. Both sides win.\n\nTHAT\'S capitalism.\n\nCrony-capitalism is where one guy wants a sack of grain and, rather than pay for it himself, he gets a couple of corrupt cops to go and shake down a small business owner in order to extract money from him. The crony-capitalist then takes the ill-gotten gains and buys the sack of grain for himself.\n\nWithout the powerful goons, the crony-capitalist is powerless.\n\nI want the goons gone. I want the crony-capitalist powerless and exposed.\n\nNo more sock-puppets. No more manipulations from the shadows.\n\nTransparency would end 99% of it overnight. The cleansing disinfectant of light.\n\nWhen people deal in abstractions--like God, or The State--they act as if it\'s some impartial, aloof party demanding their money.\n\nIt\'s always a psychological dodge to get people to think that they\'re not being robbed by individuals. Kind of like when you whack a dog for pooping on the carpet. Psychologists say to whack him with a rolled-up newspaper, because then the animal will associate the beating with the newspaper and not with you.\n\nLikewise, when thieves hide behind abstractions to rob people.\n\n"Oh, no, no, it\'s not me robbing you. It\'s this abstraction called \'government\'. You\'ll be much more willing to part with your money if I tell you that it\'s an abstraction doing it."\n\nThe reality is: The government is composed of people. \n\nAnd people can be corrupted. Politician A is more than happy to retire to a consulting position at a Wall Street firm for ten times what he made as a junior congressman--so long as he puts in a rider on a bill to funnel tax money through to Walmart.\n\nGovernment has been turned into a money laundering business. A front. A clearing house for corrupt interests.\n\nRepublics can only exist so long as moral and incorruptible men are at the helm. I think Bernie Sanders fits this bill far more than anyone in the Republican or Democratic parties. He\'s so antagonistic to the crony-capitalists, so jaded by Wall Street that I think he\'d act as a healthy foil to them. And he\'s so old and set in his ways, it\'s unlikely that he\'ll suddenly buckle under and capitulate. The dude\'s gonna be dead in a couple of years. He doesn\'t have a need for a lush consulting gig after leaving Congress.\n\nFor these reasons, I think he\'d be a good choice to act as the People\'s advocate when dealing with these vultures.\n'

Here\'s [more](http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Bernie_Sanders_Civil_Rights.htm) on his civil rights stances.\n\n&gt; Sanders was an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and participated in the historic March on Washington in 1963 as a 22-year-old student at the University of Chicago. "It was a question for me of just basic justice  the fact that it was not acceptable in America at that point that you had large numbers of African Americans who couldn\'t vote, who couldn\'t eat in a restaurant, whose kids were going to segregated schools, who couldn\'t get hotel accommodations living in segregated housing," he told the Burlington Free Press. "That was clearly a major American injustice and something that had to be dealt with."'

p236
aS"I understand this concern, but Sanders has stood by his beliefs for years and years. He's not the guy to sit back and appease to those he disagrees with. Now, obviously he will need to compromise much of the time, and I hope he is able to do that. But just having someone like him in office who is so grounded and truly believes in what is best for the American people is a great step in the right direction."
p237
aS'Difference is, Sanders has the voting record to back up his words. '
p238
aS"No, he won't. He won't because Republicans control the House and the Senate.

His supporters could very well act like Ron Paul's supporters and spam everyone. Its really only been a few days so time will tell. The last thing Sanders needs is for his supporters to run his agenda into the ground, and spawn something similar to /r/enoughpaulspam, alike to Bernie.

Hilary was supposed to win in 2008, but a virtually unknown senator from Illinois got on the ticket.

aS'The level of pessimism in the and other threads regarding Mr. Sanders is a little depressing and somewhat ironic. \n\nIf everyone thinks that he has no chance of winning and therefore resigns themselves to the usual helping of shit sandwiches...that is the EXACT mindset that allows these turds to keep parading themselves out every 4 years with their billions of dollars.\n\nLuckily Reddit doesn\'t get to decide anything. I do wish people could find a way to plow through their fog of apathy and maybe think "This might be our chance to get our government back". Because if it is...and I didn\'t participate in some way or actively sabotaged that opportunity by my inaction, I\'m no better than those who want to turn this country completely into an oligarchy.\n\nTake a chance. Try some hope, Donate...volunteer and most importantly try to get those around you involved. If you don\'t like Mr. Sanders views, fine. Don\'t vote for him. Given his years of support for the average working person...I find it hard to believe that most people wouldn\'t flock to his candidacy. \n\nIf you don\'t know what Bernie is about....please, take the time to find out.

aS"&gt;A lot of people still don't even know who Bernie Sanders is.\n\nThere is the reason he is going to have a very hard time.

aS"I think if you define crazy in terms of distance from the political center, Paul and Sanders are crazy. I could cite Hong Kong for libertarian policies in the manner that you do with Europe for more democratically socialist. Just because a policy exists elsewhere doesn't make it less crazy. So here are two candidates, not loved by the mainstream media, shunned by their parties and major league financial agents, who's supporters view them as deities. You just think his pipe dream will be the best smoke, because you agree with his stances, just as I did with Ron Paul in 2012. Principle&gt;Pragmatism.

It seems the only actual "pro gun control" vote was the "high capacity" thing, which is BS but nothing to make a big stink about. Beyond that, if we let his voting record speak for him, he seems very reasonable on gun issues.'
p257
aS"I am also 34 but a little more realistic. He won't win. Period. I agree with 99% of what he says which tell me he doesn't have a shot. Yea, he'll say stuff that resonates with the public, it'll get enough attention that the big money candidates will parrot what he says. Once one of them get elected, they will give some lip service maybe even try to get some laws passed to shut everyone up for awhile but business will continue as usual. \n\nThere is simply too much money to lose if he gets elected. OP plainly said they were glad Obama won given the alternatives. That tells me that they are very naive.  Bernie Sanders is also the first candidate that has piqued my curiosity but I'm a bit more realistic. "

aS"Sanders is not his camp. I reserve the right to think Sanders is crazy, given my own political beliefs. You don't see the difference between the behavior of Sanders supporters and Sanders himself? Like I said before, you need to be careful or you'll find yourself linked to a Sanders version of /r/enoughpaulspam. His electability isn't singularly to himself as a candidate, he depends on thousands of surrogates to help spread his message, and /r/enoughpaulspam is what happens when those surrogates aren't aware that they need to give people room to breathe, the perpetual campaign sucks.

I don\'t care if they are a Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Independent, Anarchist, Socialist, Federalist, Green... it really doesn\'t make shit of a difference to me--- doubly so for politicians from the Republicans and Democrats.\n\nI care about issues, not party.  I am also a realist, unlike most people on Reddit, and recognize that it is literally impossible to have the "perfect candidate".  So I agree with a lot of stuff Rand Paul has voted for and I disagree with some of it and I agree with a lot of stuff Bernie Sanders has voted for and disagree with some of it.  I don\'t think Rand Paul will turn the USA into some sort of Libertarian Wild West and I don\'t think Bernie Sanders will turn the USA into some sort of socialist experiment.\n\nSo no, Rand Paul isn\'t a perfect candidate nor is he identical to Bernie Sanders and I don\'t care if he is a "tea partier".  Bernie Sanders isn\'t perfect either and he has about as much electability as Rand\'s father Ron Paul but that doesn\'t mean I don\'t support him.\n\nWouldn\'t you rather live in a world where the Presidential Election was between Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders and the topics of debate were privacy, role of government, tax plan, domestic and foreign policy?  With the "Why do people always forget that Rand Paul is a Tea Partier" jingoist attitude you\'re going to get Bush vs. Clinton again and you God damn deserve it.'

aS"So, what you're saying is that candidate Sanders is better than candidate Obama? Serious question as a skeptic."
p270
aS"Understanding it does not mean we have to implement it. The NSA should not be gathering information on American citizens in a wholesale manner. Ever. \n\nSanders is saying he will stop this. With legislation and rules. Which I'm all for as I don't believe it is inevitable that all information should be gathered by the government and that the government should be able to force businesses to give my information to them with a secret courts warrant. \n\nNothing wrong with dash cams. However if all the dash cams uploaded to government severs and recognition software that seems fuckin up. "
p271
aS'I think the circlejerk is getting really annoying, and I actually support some of Bernie\'s views. Seeing a "Sanders said this!" post every page filled with "Just vote for this guy dammit!" comments is getting really old and biased.'
p272
aS"I don't think it's because they don't understand the real world, which they might very well not; maybe that's an inherent flaw of the real world as it is. I think it has more to do with the fact that they want to change the real world. We've had centuries, millennia of compromise. Trying to fit the beast in the box. This is where it has lead us. And THIS is not a good place. We need dramatic change. We need massive paradigm shifts. And maybe Bernie Sanders is not those things, but perhaps he represents a first step.\n\nThe real world problem with Bernie Sanders is not that he touts naive ideals but that there is too great a danger that he is just another puppet, that a long game is being played and nearing an even more unpleasant epoch."
p273
aS"So ... the 2016 election will be the first time I'll be voting on anything political. It seems like I'd be dumb not to vote for this guy. The Republican party just has no one I like, and hillary is a crazy evil bitch so yeah. Here's to hoping Sanders gets the nomination. "
p274
aS'You misunderstood me. When I say "this is the guy the world needs right now" my main concern is the environment and changing our use of energy. And Sanders is the first president (except for Al Gore) who really wants to take a stand against fossil fuels and slowing down climate change. That\'s what I\'m focused on. \n\nI don\'t want us to intervene for other countries\' either, and I agree with you that he\'s not going to be the President to do that. He wants the world to be as peaceful as possible. '
p275
aS"Keep saying he's un-electable and he will become that. Take a stand and help the cause and fight for what you believe in, don't naysay the best thing to happen to American politics to the point where everyone believes you. This defeatist attitude about Bernie Sanders is unsettling. He is incredibly 'grass-roots', sure, and he doesn't have big company spending to back him up, yeah, but un-electable? Not so much."
p276
aS"Okay, now how can this information get beyond reddit?  Reddit is a Bernie Sanders echo chamber.  We all get it, he is great.  Now what can actually be done to spread this great candidates popularity?  This isn't a criticism of your point.  I just want his popularity to spill over into the larger voting public."

aS"Don't get cynical just yet, Sanders has plenty of time to spread his message to the ears of ordinary Americans. \n\nBeating someone as well known as Clinton will be difficult, but it can be done."
p278
aS"Bernie Sanders is a self-avowed socialist and is pretty left of center. Ron Paul is a libertarian and as such doesn't conveniently fall on the linear spectrum as neatly, but can generally be characterized as right of center. Note that using the linear analogy for die hard libertarians is like trying to use a ruler to measure wind speed. "
p279
aS"TO BE FAIR, even if you're a radical right wing conservative, Bernie Sanders has the most developed, specific policies out of all of the candidates.

If only young people actually voted......this guy could very well be what we need."

p282
aS"It should be mentioned that this is a slightly meaningless statement, at least for proper SuperPACs. The point of a SuperPAC is that it isn't supposed to coordinate with a candidate, and isn't supposed to be connected with the candidate. While candidates often try to get around this in various dubious ways, that's not the intention, so all Sanders is really saying is that he won't have his friends start one in a dubious way.\n\nIf someone else starts a SuperPAC to support Sanders, my understanding is that he has no say in it. This is probably the point that he'll try to make when a SuperPAC is formedit could well be that his supporters here on Reddit will form onebut the statement he made will likely hurt him, as it misrepresents how legitimate SuperPACs work."
p283
aS"That Bernie Sanders is so hot right now.\n\nI am traveling to visit my die-hard republican parents this upcoming week. I am going to attempt to have a civil conversation about this and attempt to guide them to at least look into Bernie.

I have never been excited about politics, but I feel like this the only chance that we have to get this country's shit back together.\n\nThe US has been a cheap, filthy whore the decades I have been alive.

p284
aS"That's not how SuperPACs work, as they are supposed to be independent. He *can't* actually take money directly from a SuperPAC, and if someone starts one to buy ads supporting him, I don't think there's much he can do. All he can really say is that he won't abuse them by having some of his staff/colleagues/etc go start one. It is my understanding that a wealthy supporter is free to form a SuperPAC and buy ads, regardless of what Sanders thinks of SuperPACs.\n\nPeople in this very thread are going in that direction already, suggesting that people who can't donate for various reasons buy ads on reddit instead."

In recent decades, when they were riding the coattails of a superstar, like Truman following FDR, or Bush following Reagan.\n\nObama, as much as some of us on the left may like him, is nowhere near the popularity of FDR or Reagan. A generic moderate like Hillary won't be able to beat such a huge historical precedence. We need to nominate a candidate who is dynamic and can energize the base, not another Al Gore. Bernie is the candidate.\n\nSanders has a better chance of winning the White House than Clinton because a lot of people will see her as bringing a lot of baggage, and find some reason or another not to vote for her. Sanders, on the other hand, has a cleaner history -- plus he has a very clear set of goals he wants to accomplish.\n\nThere are, also, a lot of republicans that would come out to vote simply because they don't like Hillary. If Bernie was the Democratic nominee, I could see a few more republicans staying home. Don't forget, the majority of people's views align with Bernie's not Hillary's."

aS"You should be careful what you say. Bernie and Paul have a lot in common and many people opposite of your idealogical view say the same about Sanders. Are they right? I don't think Sanders it batshit insane. I feel the same about Paul.\n\nI was starting to consider this Sanders guy, but comments like this about Ron Paul just show me how immature and small minded Sanders supporters are. If his supporters continue to behave the way you do, I'll be making a pass, if this is the type of human being Sanders attracts he can't be all that good."

aS'When firefighters fight fire with fire, they create small, controlled fires to suck oxygen away from the larger burn.

He has always campaigned on consistency and doing the right thing regardless of whether it is the winning thing.  If he takes big contributions from the wealthy, and/or forms a SuperPAC, then the excuse "I had to do it to win" will not be effective against his critics, and more importantly people who might be on the fence about him.  For better or worse Bernie Sanders has to do what Bernie Sanders has always done, because that is his platform, and his appeal to his supporters.'

I think he is great, but how is he going to be able to get anything done with congress the way it is?'

Sanders is the only reason I'm still willing to support the DNC this time around.

I am not liking the attitude of a large part of his grassroots supporters so far. Of course my initial statement wasn\'t exactly nice and pleasant, but I was replying to an equally not so nice and pleasant statement.\n\nSanders has a chance to win over many of the Ron Paul people through his supporters. Keep that in mind. Sanders and Paul agree on many things, and disagree on others -- politics is about compromise, any competent voter knows this. But  half the sale will come from his supporters. Keep that in mind too -- I learned from when I supported Paul in 2007.\n\nThe grassroots community can be powerful, but I would urge Sanders community to be a bit more respectful and mature when it comes to anyone who is not on the Sanders bandwagon. Because this will help Sanders efforts instead of hurting it. I honestly was considering making major philosophical compromises to consider Sanders, but if the community continues to say things like "Ron Paul is batshit insane", well, that\'s saying I am batshit insane because I supported him.

aS'The Republican Party has drifted so far-right over time (and especially during the presidential primaries) that anyone they trot out there will do poorly against basically anyone the Democrats are likely to put forward in the Presidential election.  I\'m waiting on polls concerning how Sanders matches up against the current list of Republican candidates, but Bernie raised more during the first 24 hours of his campaign than did Rubio, Paul, or Cruz during first 24 hours of theirs.  This is especially impressive, since Bernie\'s money is coming not from well-funded PACs but from small donations from individuals: he received some 35,000 donations averaging $43.54.\n\nMeanwhile, even if the Republicans could find a moderate candidate to support the primary process would drag that candidate so far to the right that they\'d either be unelectable in the general election or have to "flip flop" on a number of issues (and leave themselves open to attack on that front) just to regain moderate voters.  While Bernie\'s seen as far-left nationally, his thoughts on inequality and his voting record on civil liberties will scoop up a bunch of independents and even a good number of people who consider themselves conservative but feel disenfranchised by the Republican Party.'

aS"I'm a 27 year old millennial tired of the same politics as usual from the same power brokers and political dynasties that have a chokehold on Washington. What we really need is a fresh start. I was very sad that no one in the democratic race inspired me until Bernie Sanders threw his hat into the race. I didn't know very much about him until this afternoon when I watched his interview with Wolf Blitzer and I was amazed at the level of integrity, honesty and empathy for us common folk that he portrayed in the short snippet that the news article included. He refused to bash Hillary Clinton even when Mr. Blitzer tried to corner him into saying something bad about her. He held is ground and was very adamant about not bashing Hillary. Such a classy guy. The thing that most struck, though, was his open ended question: In today's political arena can a politician without the supers PACS and millions of dollars that are thrown at candidates by private interest groups and individuals have a shot at running for president? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is increasingly no and that should make every single American pause for a second and feel extremely fearful for the state of affairs in this country. I don't what politics as usual, I want a revamped political system where justice is served blindly and everyone is held accountable for their actions. Where something as silly and dangerous as corporate personhood gets dismantled and someone finally stands up to those greedy bastards on Wall Street. Mr. Sanders, you have my vote and I hope we can take you as far as the White House. "

aS'There is a big deal being made about how much money Sanders has raised in 24 hours. Enough so that it seems remarkable and amazing that it is so much, so fast. Our interpretation of this is meant to see the campaign as legitimate and highly supported and desired. They are trying to gain your confidence that donating to the campaign is a legitimate thing to do, which many other people are already doing.\n\nConsider the case that this is entirely made up, or that the $1.5 mil was money they already had before the campaign launch, and it was just "donated" to the campaign upon the start of the campaign, since it just started.\n\nThis same thing is done on Kickstarter all the time. Companies can contribute money to themselves, into their own kickstarter campaign, anonymously. They just have to pay the 5% fee on it to Kickstarter. That lets them look like they a project has already raise a million dollars and is already above some funding threshold. Which would you rather buy into, a campaign that has not met its funding goal, and has only a few thousand in funding, or one that is at 2000% of it it\'s funding goal, with millions already behind it?

One way to counter this obnoxious and self-defeating attitude is, of course, for a bunch of us to say "well if you don\'t vote for the radical leftist fuck you we\'ll fuck your party up anyways."\n\nLet Sanders do whatever he thinks he needs to do.

And I absolutely hate Sanders' populist rhetoric.\n\nThe third option, here, would be finding a progressive that isn't Hillary, but also is much more palatable than Sanders. I would also like someone to run who isn't just a voting record and populist speech maker, but someone who has actually has a record of real leadership in getting things done in Congress. And that man is NOT Sanders. You may like his voting record, but he hasn't actually... well, done anything.\n\nIf Sanders by some miracle becomes President, he will be a complete failure a la Obama, because to be successful requires more than just pretty words.

aS"&gt; I was referring to those taxed into poverty\n\nI'm not convinced that people are *taxed* into poverty.\n\n&gt; If the policies worked, they would be done so in the private market, then adopted by the public sector\n\nAgain, I disagree. Fundamental scientific research is often not immediately profitable, and a lot of it wouldn't get done without government funding. Long term research projects don't often look appealing to private businesses either, even if the potential return is enormous. What's private funding for fusion research look like compared to the (still inadequate) public funding?\n\nMore importantly, where's the economic incentive for power companies to reduce CO2 emissions? How could a program like SNAP be run by a private, for profit business? That's essentially charity work.\n\nJust because something isn't *profitable* in capitalistic terms, doesn't mean it doesn't *work* or isn't *worthwhile*.\n\n&gt; Policies should be tested out where the customer, or taxpayer, has an element of choice, so money isn't wasted on Iraq and the drug war or other ridiculous ventures that hold no value to society. \n\nYou and I and Bernie are all in agreement over Iraq and drug policy.\n\n&gt; So if what you spend on money matters, wouldn't you want the mechanism that provides the most choice, rather than the entity that restricts it?\n\nDon't get me wrong, the market and private enterprise can be *very* efficient at a *lot* of things. I just don't think the market can fulfill every need in society. I think that private enterprise can actually *limit* choice in some ways and in some instances, but what's more essential is that I don't consider choice an intrinsic good. I'm sure you can think of an example when having only one or a couple of choices might be better than having a dozen, depending on what the choices are.\n\nI don't see why providing government services even has to restrict choice, per se. We provide public schooling, but private schools exist. Canada has a national healthcare system, but private insurance still exists.\n\n&gt; Also I could use your crying river argument with America, who gives a shit if we shed a few tears if millions are being fed in Africa. We don't do that because it violates property rights. \n\nIt seems like you've missed the point I made about foreign impoverished nations and the *actual* living conditions of ~40% of Americans. If you took from the poorest Americans to feed Africa, they would literally go hungry themselves. Moreover, there are political complications and huge issues of logistics that make the analogy a radically different situation.\n\n&gt; Oh I'm sorry am I supposed to look at MSNBC for dissent on the New Deal programs?\n\nProbably not, but I wouldn't know. I don't watch cable news.\n\n&gt; Its funny, Soros never gets mentioned around here.\n\nBernie Sanders isn't for campaign finance reform *just* for the Kochs. It would apply to Soros as well. That said, the Kochs [massively outspend Soros](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2010/09/opensecrets-battle-koch-brothers/). There's money on both sides, but not in the same amounts."

But don't forget that while the NSA spies on us which is grossly illegal and controversial, they are there to do what they can to prevent another 9/11. Don't get me wrong, I do believe they need to stay within the confines of the Constitution regarding U.S citizens, but at some point there needs to be some give and take. What or where is that level of give and take? That is what congressional hearings and senate hearings are for. We need to make meaningful progress in the discussion of national security, not just say this shit is bad, get rid of it. It is ridiculous to think that we don't need some sort of security net to protect America from terrorists.

Just as Bernie Sanders doesn't want to put gramma in a gas chamber or force people to wait in breadlines just because he's a socialist. He actually believes that people would be better off if the government taxed the rich and tried to take care of the poor."

aS'&gt; For what it\'s worth though, Obama\'s chances seemed pretty slim at this point 8 years ago.\n\nThat\'s a little misleading FYI. [Here\'s the wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) with Primary voting in the run-up to 2008.\n\nThe following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:\n\n* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, \n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%\n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%\n\nNow, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):\n\n* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% \n\n* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   \n\n* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, \n\n* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%\n\nSo, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It\'s hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it\'s an insanely large difference.\n\nSecondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus "not-Hillary" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary\'s level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains "flat" she\'ll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). \n\nAdditionally, the "not Hillary / Bernie" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she\'s included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She\'s [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). \n\nIf I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the \'08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially "Warren Lite". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.\n\nSo where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)\n\n-----------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama "only" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she\'s doing a better job positioning herself as the "populist" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn\'t chip away at her initial polling numbers.\n\n[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]'

aS'What outlandish statements are you referring to?\n\nThis one?\n\n&gt;"Kids will grow up knowing that every damn thing that they do is going to be recorded some place in a file, and I think that will have a very Orwellian and very inhibiting impact on the way we live our lives," Sanders told MSNBC\'s Chris Hayes just days after the initial batch of Snowden files emerged. "I want our law enforcement people to be vigorous in going after terrorists. But I happen to believe they can do that without disregarding the Constitution of the United States or the civil liberties of the American people."\n\nOr this one?\n\n&gt;"I am deeply concerned about recent revelations that the National Security Agency (NSA) and other intelligence agencies are collecting enormous amounts of information about phone calls that Americans make, emails that we send, and websites that we visit," Sanders wrote then. "In my view, these actions are clearly unconstitutional."\n\nBecause those are the only two statements of Sanders\' in the article, and--since that is the topic of discussion--I assume that is what you are referring to.  What part of what he said is overarching and outlandish?\n\n&gt;this is just as ridiculous as anything the right has said\n\nSo this is just as ridiculous as women\'s bodies shut themselves down in the case of legitimate rape?\n\nIs this as ridiculous as saying gay sex causes natural disasters?\n\nIs it as ridiculous as saying that the end days are near and that Jesus will soon be returning to Earth?\n\nBecause that is all ridiculous shit that Tea Party members have said, and I for one cannot see how Bernie\'s statements could possibly be compared to the three I\'ve listed unless it were on Sesame Street\'s "Which of these things is not like the others?"\n\nEdit:  I want to point out that I have searched for an actual quote of Bernie saying that he would "dismantle NSA spying" and am unable to find one.  Though it has been shared a bit on social media, that line comes *only* from the headline of this article and all instances of it mention the *National Journal* as the sole source.  So, did Bernie actually say that, or was it just an implication that the author ran with?\n\nAlso, I would not be opposed to him dismantling the NSA\'s spying on American citizens.  It\'s not as if that it actually what the NSA is meant to do.  They have another purpose, and they should be fulfilling *it* instead of collecting data on their own citizens.  Dismantling their domestic spying operations would not stop them from fulfilling their original purpose.  \n\n\n\n\n\n'

aS'&gt; But Sanders\' skepticism of the intelligence agencies predates the Snowden revelations by more than a decade. While still serving in the House, he was one of just 66 members to vote against the post-9/11 Patriot Act, which greatly expanded the government\'s military and spying capabilities and eventually came to represent the legal justification for the NSA\'s bulk collection of U.S. call data. Sanders has also voted against reauthorizations of the Patriot Act, as well as the FISA Amendments Act in 2008.\n\n&gt; And last year, Sanders voted for the Senate\'s USA Freedom Act, which would have effectively ended the phone-records program.\n\nLOL, "go back to your video games". At least I know how to RTFA, you smugly ignorant twat.'

aS'No, he doesn\'t. Sanders is an elderly, uncharismatic, white, Jewish, self-proclaimed socialist. Pretty much the *only* thing he has going for him is support from the far-left youth- a demographic with such an abysmal voting record, that it is arguably the least important voting demographic in the country. The biggest youth turn-out for a presidential election was in 2008 at 51%, still significantly below the average for other dems... And that was when a cool, charismatic, young black guy was running. \n\nFiveThiryEight, one of the most reputable and accurate election forecasters in the country, has literally said "he doesn\'t have a shot". He polls 57 points behind Clinton nationally, which is a monumental gap that will be nearly impossible to even half-way close. Having a bunch of your fringe supporters donate to your campaign the first day doesn\'t change that. And, let\'s be honest- yeah, he out raised what other Republicans raised on their first days, but it\'s not like it was by a massive amount. Paul raised just over $1 million and Cruz raised just under that.\n\nIt\'s not like there is some monumental movement to get Sanders elected- just a very loyal and very dedicated small following that will probably get him through Iowa and New Hampshire and then fade into non-existence come March.'

aS'First of all, thanks.  That was a really good read and probably something everybody who is interested in Sanders should read.\n\nSome of those "steps" are actual policies that I agree with, but some of them are just "this is bad, we should do a good thing instead"\n\nSaying that women should earn the same as men is easy, saying how you are going to do it is harder.  Saying that we need to craft trade agreements that encourage job creation in America is easy, saying how you are going to do it is harder.\n\nTo be specific:\n\n1 and 2 are mostly spot on, and #3 is alright, though I\'m not sure how it would be accomplished.  As a member of a union who wishes he wasn\'t, I just don\'t agree with #4 - for lots of reasons - but I can understand why many would agree with him and disagree with me.  #5 is silly, I am a supporter of getting rid of the minimum wage entirely (see my previous comment for what I believe to be a superior solution).  #6 is meaningless, I am sure we can all agree that bad things are bad, #7 speaks to what I mentioned before, except my comment was more specific (as opposed to, lets make less bad agreements, and more good ones!), #8 sounds good to me.  Again, not a step but just a good idea.  #9 Difficult to implement, but I agree - it is hard to argue that finance hasn\'t gotten out of control. #10 Preach it, Sanders #11 SS and Medicare have huge structural issues that need to be addressed.  This is a pretty meaningless statement if it does not mention and address these issues. #12 I disagree, corporations should pay absolutely nothing, because they are not people.  (Aside: They are not people, law should recognize that fact).  Taxes pervert markets, in ways many people find difficult to understand and believe.  Corporate taxes are not the answer.  \n\nThe thing is, people want corporations to pay taxes because they want to hit those rich owners.  Regardless of whether the owners are actually rich or not (irrelevant) - the better way to do this is through a progressive income tax.  Of course this would require a massive overhaul of many, many things, so please don\'t respond to this last point as if it would just be the elimination of the corporation tax and nothing else - because obviously that would be a terrible and inequitable thing to do.\n\n\n\nOverall, Sanders does well - but I don\'t think he can possibly win, I am not confident he would be an effective leader and I am not confident he would be effective outside of the United States.  He can of course do his best to change my mind, but so far I see an internally-minded (internal to the country) populist socialist trying to win the presidency.  I just don\'t believe it is going to happen, and at this point he hasn\'t said anything that gets me excited enough to support a losing candidate. '

I\'m not saying you shouldn\'t vote for Sanders or help with his campaign, I\'m saying you shouldn\'t go around saying that he has a realistic shot of winning the presidency or blaming his low poll numbers on "the media" or whatever scapegoat you want to use, when the reality is he\'s just not a statistically good candidate.

p397
aS'True, but it speaks to the groundswell of support.\n\nThe implication being that Sanders has more support "of the people" than any other candidate, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nOf course, this ignores that if you lump them together GOP candidates have a great deal more public support.  The total money given to GOP candidates is far more than Sanders got.\n\nRubio, Cruz, and Paul are fringe candidates in the same way Sanders is.  They have a broader field, for sure, but it does show that Sanders resonates with a subset that is "stronger" than the subsets that support each GOP offering.\n\nIt is true that a more valid comparison would be Sanders\' donations versus Hillary\'s, but what the heck.'

Fortunately for her, one hasn\'t shown up yet, but if one does, or one reinvents themselves, she\'s going to have a very hard time winning. Which is why it\'s so important that we do everything to help Sanders win the nomination, because he will be able to run circles around the republicans with his middle class message and record, and the record to back him up.

p419
aS'lolno.\n\nSanders is already past the "danger" period for men, which causes their life expectancy to be lower on average: \n&gt;Between ages 15 and 24 years, men are four to five times more likely to die than women. This time frame coincides with the onset of puberty and an increase in reckless and violent behavior in males. http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/10.01/WhyWomenLiveLon.html\n\nThe only time where you could say that men are much more likely to die than women at any given age is that period, and if they are 100+ years old. A man and his 70\'s and a woman in her\'s are statistically pretty equally likely to die. \n\nEven then, the overall life expectancy difference is less than 4 years apart now, less than the length of one presidency.

aS"I just realized how much Bernie Sanders sounds like [Larry David's George Steinbrenner.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJtDt10fRqw)"
p421
aS"I was only exaggerating the desperation.\n\nI know Sanders doesn't have a great (or even good) chance but I can't just accept that and not even try."
p422
aS"That's a completely different situation though. Clinton and Obama are both relatively moderate democrats. Sanders is a socialist, which to many people in the US basically makes him a communist. "
p423
aS"All thoughts below are my opinion and not based on facts or reason.\n\n1) This is /r/politics - what is more political than a new presidential bid / possible POTUS of 4/8 years?\n\n2) I haven't heard of anyone new who entered the race for spot of POTUS since Mr Sanders put in his bid.  \n\n3) His voice against big corporations and their influence on our politics is rather unique (within the POTUS contenders).  At least as much as I believe he would actually try to do something about it, and not just spouting popular rhetoric.\n\n4) After years of political double speak - politicians who stay on point and seem to be honest have a very strong pull with people who are sick of lies.  I think you'd have to search very hard to find an actual Lie spoken by Mr Sanders. Even if you don't agree with his policies, I think you'd be hard pressed to find evidence that he may be dis-honest.\n\nNot that I've been linking stories, but for me personally, Mr Sanders draws me in the same way Ron Paul did years ago.  Mostly by being honest and on target.  The difference being, I agree with almost everything Mr Sanders has been talking about - AND - he does not treat compromise like an evil thing."

aS"I didn't say Democrats call Obama a communist.  Sanders is running as a Democrat, so I doubt Democrats are going to start calling him a communist."
p426
aS"Except that where Sanders is starting off (twice as poorly as Obama) isn't what really concerns me, it's the fact that Hillary already has well over half the Dems voting for her. If you look at the polling data through the primary in 2008, her number stayed fairly flat, if that happens again, she wins in a landslide. Again, for Sanders to have ANY shot, he has to sway away a third of Clinton's donors, which seems like an insurmountable feat. However, it's not like this is what I do for a living (lawyer), so I could be wrong."
p427
aS'The problem with the logic here is that banks are big do to the government forcing them to buy one another during the financial crisis. Instead of letting the institutions spin off profitable components of their business they made the other banks buy the toxic assets and then gave them loans until the assets reached a point of stable market value. \n\nAnother point of contention is that the government never lost a dime on TARP (bailouts). All of the money was paid back with interest. Somthing that both Warren and Sanders leave out of their normal rants. \n\nSanders and Warren play the game of filthy liar politics that plagues much of politics on America on both sides. They say ridiculous things that are easy to verify as false and no one seems to call them on it because A) they are an idiot pundit who likes them, or B) People are to ignorant to understand all of this anyway. \n\nBernie Sanders is a flash in the pan in presidential politics. \n\n'
p428
aS"Sanders has no chance. I assume his candidacy is for publicity purposes, and possibly to try to induce Clinton to make some commitments during primaries to be a little more to the left.\n\nIt's not just the two-party system. In a national election you have to be near the median voter to have a chance to win; Sanders is too far to the left. Selecting him in the primaries would also mean passing on a historic opportunity to elect a female president instead of an old white guy."

aS"But how would moderates know that Sanders is far more socialist than Obama is what I'm saying.  What can Sander's detractors say to convince people on the fence that Sanders is actually a socialist?"

p431
aS"Generally the incumbent party also has trouble winning the general election as well, so it's certainly no guarantee that Clinton has a strong chance of winning the general election, either (although this election will probably have some key differences from past elections). \n\nSanders is the most liberal; however, both parties are already pulled far to the right, and as the [most liberal Senator he's closer to center than anyone else](http://www.politicalcompass.org/usstates?al=on&amp;ak=on&amp;az=on&amp;ar=on&amp;ca=on&amp;co=on&amp;ct=on&amp;de=on&amp;fl=on&amp;ga=on&amp;hi=on&amp;id=on&amp;il=on&amp;in=on&amp;ia=on&amp;ks=on&amp;ky=on&amp;la=on&amp;me=on&amp;md=on&amp;ma=on&amp;mi=on&amp;mn=on&amp;ms=on&amp;mo=on&amp;mt=on&amp;ne=on&amp;nv=on&amp;nh=on&amp;nj=on&amp;nm=on&amp;ny=on&amp;nc=on&amp;nd=on&amp;oh=on&amp;ok=on&amp;or=on&amp;pa=on&amp;ri=on&amp;sc=on&amp;sd=on&amp;tn=on&amp;tx=on&amp;ut=on&amp;vt=on&amp;va=on&amp;wa=on&amp;wv=on&amp;wi=on&amp;wy=on). \n\nHe does have a history of winning over traditionally conservative votes (although it is Vermont) as well. He may be appealing to a wider demographic because of social issues as well, which seem like they will play a major role in this election cycle. "

aS"This is a VERY good point and something I hadn't considered. After looking it up I see that Obama did in fact announce his candidacy way back in early Feb (Feb 10). So by the time May came around he'd been campaigning for several months.\n\nSo lets look at the data back in mid-Feb. We've got 2 polls done 2 days after he announced:\n\nPoll 1\n\n* Clinton 37% - Obama 17%, \n\nPoll 2\n\n* Clinton 28%, Obama 24%\n\nSo this actually paints an even bleaker picture for Sanders. Coming into the face, Obama and Clinton were polling neck and neck in one poll and were relatively close in the other. Sanders is down by like 50 points in all of the polls today.\n\nSo while you are right to think that my initial post is lacking, it turns out, by chance, not to change my conclusions at all. That said, thank you for the comment and for pointing that out!\n\n\n\n"

And those jobs have a lot of layoff time involved Depending on your employer\'s ability to get contacts and winter work. \n\n&gt;Most of the jobs that are left Americans will not do for less then minimum wage.\n\nWhat jobs are the ones that pay less than minimum wage?

aS'Sorry, Ron is simply damaged goods , whatever role he plays. Sanders is simply too far ahead of the electorate.'
p443
aS'Sanders has a chance in the general election, given he gets there, in part because politics is a team sport and many people will hold their nose and vote for a socialist instead of vote for a Republican.\n\nThat leaves the primary in which the moderate Democrats are less likely to make a showing. Sanders declaring his candidacy was enough to bring me into the primary process and hopefully will be for many other progressive young people.\n\nThere is certainly a concerning lack of funds for his campaign and I remember him directly saying on CNN that he would refuse super-PAC money (http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/politics/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-first-interview/). If Sanders won it would prove that lack of money is not by itself sufficient for a candidate to lose which would be progress in and of itself.\n\nTL;DR Sanders has a chance because primaries matter more, by some interpretations the reason the Tea Party candidates had a chance.'
p444
aS"She'd be 74 in 2024. Sanders is already 73. An America in 2024 dominated by generations as age/beauty obsessed as the baby boomers and millennials will probably never elect someone old enough to be a great-grandparent into office. Hillary is already pushing it at 69/70.  Same age as Reagan, and we know how that turned out."

You are also burdened by the fact you have have to win.\n\nI've heard nothing but good ideas and good things from BOTH Warren and Sanders. The problem, though, is that they can't win. I don't think either of them could win the ticket AND I think they may have a tough time winning the Presidential, too.\n\nWarren had a heck of a time beating a Republican in a very blue state. How would she do in a National race against the Koch machine?\n\nSanders is no better in that regard either.\n\nHillary knows how to WIN. The closest person to beating Obama for the Presidency was not Romney nor McCain. It was Clinton.\n\nSo, while I personally may like Warren and Sanders ideas more than I like Clinton, I MUCH more support Clinton in the next race because I want the Democrats to win. Clinton has the best mix of ideas and winnability for my money."

Bernie Sanders is light years better and a polar opposite politically.'
p449
aS'Thanks for such a fantastic response!  I think it should also be considered that Clinton in this cycle is benefitting from the investments she made in that first campaign. Both in name recognition, and the in presumption of inevitability. \n\nI\'d read this as a candidate with an unprecedented "pre-campaign" (Clinton) affecting the polling by people trying to pick the winner when they\'re asked who they support. \n\nThere was an analogue in the \'08 campaigns that I\'m using to temper the early polling. When the black community was polled pre-Iowa Obama did poorly, then afterward dominated that demo. People need to believe their candidate can win before they\'ll voice support. \n\nSanders needs a proof of viability moment. '
p450
aS'I mean, it could be true, but even if it isn\'t things would be identical. ... just to spitball some counter-points\n\nIt\'s way too early to go negative. \n\nThe economy is doing well yet wages and employment don\'t reflect that improvement so we\'re primed for a populist candidate, meaning HRC can\'t avoid a challenge from the left.\n\nReagan was 69 when elected - Mccain would have been 71 and he\'s still kickin\'. Rich people live a long time and women tend to live even longer still. \n\nThe "11th commandment" of not saying anything bad about another member of your party hasn\'t existed for a long time, yet we do live in a partisan climate and if there\'s one thing anyone in the D primary will agree on it\'s that they don\'t want an R to win. So even though Clinton gets some grey money from dark places, no one is going to make that an issue in the primary unless they are bottom tier or desperate. In the same vein of not poisoning the well, HRC is not going to come right out and say Sanders is too far left - but also because her strategy will be to ignore him, to maintain the image of "inevitable" and being the best candidate to fight whatever the GOP churns up.\n\nHistory being any guide, having a long Dem primary with debates on the issues and avoiding overt negativity seems to result in a stronger candidate with a more tested campaign and more active network. \n\nSo anyway, it\'s POSSIBLE. But I just see no way to make that conclusion with this evidence.'

Don't be fooled, Warren has been getting a ton of media coverage, but Bernie has been hammering these points for many years.  The topics that have finally sifted to the surface of America's political consciousness aren't new but we're finally ready to address them.  I for one wouldn't mind seeing someone who spotted them decades ago have a shot at fixing them."

aS'You make some good points, but right now we need to be somewhere towing the line of realism and idealism. It\'s not *when* Bernie loses. It\'s *if* he loses. And *if* he loses then we will most likely get Clinton or Paul. Neither of those choices are candidates I am ready to accept nor are they what we need right now to fight for what the majority of Americans seem to believe in though we are trained to forget. WE NEED OUR RIGHTS BACK and no one is going to fight for that like Sanders. \n\nInstead of focusing on what the system allows - what\'s "realistic for America" - I choose to believe in what the people want. What people need. Not what the top .5% can pay for. That is why this attitude about Bernie is nearly infuriating. Why should we settle for "realistic" when the very standard by which we come up with it is corrupt, full of secrecy, and genuinely harmful to us as common Americans? Why should we not stand for idealism and what we believe in and damn the torpedoes? This is our future as Americans... And I will not go down without a fight. '

Honestly, fuck you if you think that you are entitled to exclude people from some administrative boundaries just because, through no work of your own, you happened to be born within those boundaries. Sanders said something like this about the Vietnamese working class taking jobs from the American working class, and how that needs to end and companies must stop employing them and come back here.\n\nFuck that tribalistic and nationalistic nonsense. I fully support a guaranteed basic income and luxurious welfare. But denying a hardworking person who offers a better value proposition to an employer from working for that employer and sheltering American workers from competition is bullshit. That is way too intrusive.\n\nThe fact is that the poor in America are still in the top 1% globally. The concerns of poor Americans are legitimate and they must be provided for. But there is no reason why the 99% should be actively excluded from -- not welfare -- but working and earning some money.'

aS"He isn't. He's supposed to lose quietly and then go away. Which he will, unless he decides to run independently after losing the Democratic primary.\n\nThe media has told most Americans he has no chance of winning for propaganda purposes, no doubt, but it's also the truth. Most people in this country are deathly afraid of socialism, because that's what they've been brainwashed into fearing by several generations of propaganda, and Bernie Sanders is a self-described socialist. In the average American retard's mind, he may as well be a self-described serial killer.\n\nIt's a miracle that he's even allowed into the District of Columbia at all, but there's not a snowball's chance in hell he'll be allowed into the White House. The powers that be will not stand for it, they've got a well-oiled propaganda machine with which to stop him, and if they *do* let him win, it'll be because they managed to bend him to their willlike they did Barack Obama.\n\nIf something looks too good to be true, that's because it is, and Bernie Sanders' presidential run looks *way* too good to be true."

aS'As much as I like reddit.  Reddit is not a good indicator of how the general public views candidates.  Just as digg before reddit was not a good indicator of peoples political views.  This will be my third primary election I have viewed through the lens of social media site.  It was digg in 2008 and reddit in 2012.  I think the problem is that a lot of the communities and subs are just to insulated.  I think Sanders is a good candidate and will do well.  That being said I think reddit underestimates the appeal that Hillary Clinton has.  I know it is counter to the views I hear on /r/politics but her being a familiar face and Bills husband is going to help tremendously.  His time in office is remembered by many people as being great.  Anyone who has to run against her is going to have a very difficult time.'

aS"That is just a *breaktakingly* stupid statement. \n\nIf the GOP has a zero percent chance of victory, why are so many people contending for the right to lose? \n\nIf the same number of people are going to vote for the GOP candidate no matter who it is, then 'mobilizing apathetic voters' is purely a feature of Democratic voters. \n\nIf that is *not* true - if the candidate matters - then victory in the primaries does *not* guarantee victory in the general election \n\nSanders has a very vocal and passionate crowd that supports him, and has a kind of quizzical confusion why everyone doesn't see things their way. \n\nKinda like Huckabee and Santorum voter. They're convinced that if their preferred candidate wins the nomination victory is inevitable - while ignoring how polarizing their candidate is. \n\nIf Sanders cannot convince moderates and less passionate voters he is worth supporting, he loses. \n\nThat may not be what you want to hear, but that is reality "
p477
aS'I agree with what you wrote, I think there\'s just a disconnect between what I said and what you heard (though it could very well be in how I phrased it).\n\nI am stating that the people who voted for Nader were the "ideologues" of the Democratic party who\'s views perfectly aligned with Nader and so they voted for him. However, their decision to do this was not "pragmatic" insofar as there was no chance Nader could win. The most Nader could do was let Bush win, which he did a splendid job at.\n\nSo while Sanders\' decision to run as a Dem is in no way analogous to Nader\'s decision to run as an independent, IMO, supporting Sanders will likely have the same effect in the end and for the same reasons - Sanders does not stand much of a chance in the general (for all the reasons you know to be true but hope we can "change").\n\nIn my mind, this election (and relection assuming a victory in the general), may be one of the most important for the next two decades because of the current ages of Justices on the Court. There are a few really old Justices and a few really young ones. There\'s a chance we can have the most liberal Court this country has ever seen and use it to push the country forward in a way never seen before. THIS is the most important issue facing America right now IMO and why I care quite a bit about the election. \n\nThat said, thank you for your comment and what you wrote is absolutely correct.'

aS"Who are we referring to? The difference between Sanders and Clinton is just over 5 years, and Sanders is 5 years younger than mccain (but McCain would have been 1 year younger at the time he would be elected). \n\nOn a population-level, a few years at that age might make a bit of a difference. Average life expectancy for a 73 year old is 12.1 years, with the 3 most likely deaths to be smoking or obesity related (Bernie has neither as a risk factor). McCain smoked a lot, was a POW and really wasn't in the best of health anyway, but the life expectancy for the average male at McCain's age when he ran is just under a year longer than Bernie's age. You have to consider that these are averages, and there is more to a person's health than just their age. I'd much rather be a fit, 73 year old hippie than a 68 year old obese smoker who has a stick up their ass. \n\nSanders also lives in Vermont, which has one of the highest life expectancies of all the States (about 6-7 years longer than Southern states like Mississippi)"

I mean, the NRA endorsed Kratovil over Harris. You can\'t explain that. \n\nthe NRA is a joke. The GOA is marginally better, and they showed that in supporting Bernie Sanders with his opposition to H.R. 3199 (government keeping gun records). \n\nThe bottom line is that the super rich control the NRA, and bernie sanders is in their way. the NRA doesn\'t care about gun rights, they care about money. Senators who vote for gun rights also usually vote for corporate tax cuts, etc. so it just looks like the NRA actually cares about gun laws in some cases. '

aS"Sanders is fully worthy of support.\n\nHowever, I've been around long enough to see how the campaigns of Robert K, McGovern, and the presidency of Carter were sabotaged by the Democratic National Committee, which is the fundraising arm of the Democratic Party.\n\nFuck the Clintons and fuck the way that the Obamas have to kowtow to the fundraising arm of the Shit Party, which is the alternative to the Assfuck Party."
p486
aS"I'd agree with. If however, someone else thinks Sanders has a very high chance then I'm perfectly happy making a closer bet than that. I've also made bets with people on this issue at what amounted to 3:1 odds or 2.5:1 odds. "

p489
aS"The important things to note about those numbers: \n\n1. 47.8% of Democrats aren't in love with Hillary Clinton. \n\n2. Warren is not running for President and the closest politician to her is Sanders. 12.7+5.6=18.6%.\n\n3. Sanders is not well known. For that matter, neither is Warren. But now he will be. Let's see how these numbers change in a few months. I'd like to see a poll that just covers the two people actually running, so we could see how many prefer one to the other at this stage in the race."

aS"He's never expressed a belief that the workers should rise up and take control of businesses and the means of production. A democratic socialist (which is what Sanders is) isn't the same as a socialist."

aS"Sanders is running solely because after travelling the country he saw a large enough grassroots support for himself to win. \n\nI have to call b/s on that camp being for Hillary. If anything they're for Warren.  When Bernie's name gets out, they'll be for him. "
p492
aS"There's way more than 1.5 million redditors. Not all current and potential Sanders supporters subscribe here. "

aS'&gt; why are so many people contending for the right to lose?\n\n$\n\n&gt; \'mobilizing apathetic voters\' is purely a feature of Democratic voters.\n\nIt is something a democratic candidate may or may not do.  Hillary may not, Sanders will.  That is just a compounding factor to why 2016 is a 0% chance republicans can win.  There will be enough people showing up just because it\'s a presidential election to make republicans unelectable.  \n\n&gt; That may not be what you want to hear, but that is reality\n\nYou said alot of "mays" that is against reality.  Sanders has been going around the country himself, and he knows he has the grassroots support to win.  He said himself that if he didn\'t think he could win, he wouldn\'t run, because that would hurt his message.  Santorum and Huckabee tried using the top-down approach, nothing like what Sanders is doing.  \n\nPeople got out to vote for Obama because of his message.  They\'ll go out for Sanders.'
p497
aS'&gt; Based upon what?\n\nBecause there are 10% of voters saying they support Warren over Hillary.  4% support Sanders (and this was long before he announced running, and obviously before he started spending to get his name out, as that hasn\'t started yet.  3% are for other candidates, like Jim Webb.  The dem voters who read up and care, they are not for Hillary.  They\'ll be going to Sanders.  \n\nPlus, he has already seen enough grassroots support to take on Hillary.  He\'s been going around the country this last year, to see.  \n\nRight, Hillary has the big donors.  First of all, I\'m pointing out that Sanders can spend big with reddit alone, so idk why you bring up that Hillary has corporate support.  The grassroots people for Obama (and a big reason why he won, it\'s not a "machine") were there for a liberal cause.  They deserted Hillary then, they will again.  You know how bad that will look, when Hillary is getting hundreds of millions in corporate money, and Sanders is doing well with grassroots alone?  She\'s going to need alot of luck for primary voters not to see that.  \n\nSanders has the grassroots.  He has the message and public speaking talent.  He also does not need to outspend Hillary.  He needs to have enough to get out frequently enough.  He can get that alone with reddit supporters giving $10-$15 dollar a month.\n\n\n\n\n\n'

aS'&gt; the Warren supporters AND the Sanders supporters AND the supporters of "other" candidates you\'re not even to 20%\n\nAnd that was when none of them said they are running for president!  Or started to try gaining name recognition yet!  \n\nIt\'s not going to be the casual 80% who are the big grassroots supporters, it will be the highly-information 20%.\n\n&gt; What is your basis for claiming that all the Hillary campaign workers, volunteers, and canvassers (joined by the Obama team) will jump ship?\n\nThey jumped ship last time.  Why do you think so?  In the beginning, Obama was considered by most as a long-shot.  He had to run against not only Hillary, but her former president husband also campaigning on her behalf.  Fact is, these dem voters don\'t want Hillary, they want a progressive.  They thought Obama was that progressive.  Now, Sanders is here to take these grassroots workers.\n\n'

aS'&gt;Unless you\'re an anarcho-capitalist, you\'re a socialist,\n\nNo, I am not a socialist. You are crazy to think I am one. I don\'t become one just because a random Bernie Sanders groupie says so. Infrastructure has nothing to do with socialism. IIRC socialist governments suck at it. Look at Burma, Cuba or North Korea. Yes they are socialist, real ones; don\'t make the "real Scotsman" argument with me. '
p507
aS"You begin with a false assumption, that by winning is the only way to make an impact. This is peddled by the media who aren't really interested in reporting how the actual politics works.\n\nNow, it is true that being part of the winning party gives you most of the benefits. So the GOP lost out in both '08 &amp; '12, because none of the executive policy makes will be from the conservatives. (Not *entirely* true, of course, as many corporate donors ask for some of their people to be elevated, regardless of politics, but that's another story for another post.)\n\nRemember in '08, when it was Hillary v Obama? Hillary lost, and then became Secretary of State. She was our foreign policy during those years. Also, going into the convention, the party forms their platform, and those with electoral votes usually have a large say in how that is formed. You might have notice how Hillary quickly changed many of her views to align with Bernie after he announced his candidacy.\n\nWhile Americans focus on the One Person As President (again, with heavy media encouragement), it really is an Administration, with a lot of people forming and implementing the policy. \n\nBy running as a Democrat in a year in which it is nearly guaranteed for a Democrat victory (unless the unlikely occurs, in which a non-crazy conservative can be found that somehow appeases their anti-LGBT global-warming-is-a-hoax base while not actually being anti-LGBT and accepting the facts of HCGW who can also distance themselves from the Koch bros.) That means that even though he may not become president, he will have a greater power to influence policy over a HClinton WH than as a senator. He might be named Vice President, or Secretary of the Treasury, Interior, Energy, Commerce. \n\nThis is actually a very good move by Bernie, because it puts him at the Big Table in the executive branch. The more he raises, the more votes he gets, the more powerful he can be placed.\n\nHe is very different from someone like Nader, who really was an outsider and could have been safely ignored had Gore won (or the SCOTUS not conducted treason, but again, that's a completely different post.) Sanders is very much a part of the political establishment, and his supporters can shift the Democratic party profoundly away from the corporate-centrists of the Clintons."
p508
aS"Nader was and is a political tard running in some easily maniuplated, disorganized divide and conquer party.  Sanders understands politics and is running for the Democratic party endorsement.  If Nader had the wisdom of Sanders, he'd have been President.  The only memory now is of his political ignorance and lack of solidarity with the people who would have welcomed him as a party endorsed candidate."
p509
aS"Well, given that one of his major platforms is an affordable college education, I doubt he'll do anything negative in regards to Veteran benefits. Pair this with the fact that he's a member of the Senate VA committee, from which he has pushed and passed some much needed reforms, I think the military/vets will actually do better with Sanders.\n  \nI think service members are scared that he will cut their pay, benefits, etc, but when Sanders says he wants to cut the military budget, he's predominantly talking about how wasteful it is keep pumping money into military industrial complex. I know I'm probably one of the few in the military that support him (for now), as most service members are republican (even though the GOP constantly votes against their interests). "
p510
aS"Sanders is not anti authority though... he is a large advocate og government authority.   What he is against is police and military authority.\n\nAnd calling Paul's ideas common sense is exactly the comparison that needs laughing at."
p511
aS"They were talking about him on NPR and suggested that he's going to bring up a lot of things to force Hilary to take a stand on, IE take Sanders stand on, to make sure she gets his supporters. \n\nIn the end this may just be him trying to get his agenda noticed, and not actually a challenge to her bid. "
p512
aS"&gt; Anyway, he has my vote for the primary at least.\n\nI literally said I was voting for him in the primary. That means if he wins the primary, I'll also vote for him in the general election. The reason I'm not going to chase this write-in pipe dream is because it won't work. If Sanders can't win the primary (with his name actually on the ballot), how the hell is he going to win the general election with his name *not on the ballot?*\n\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n&gt;Keep finding reasons to wimp out &amp; vote for Hillary\n\nI don't *want* Hillary for president, I'd much rather prefer Warren or Sanders. That is why Sanders has got my primary vote at the very least. What I want is an *actual* liberal/progressive president, and what I absolutely do not want is a Republican president who will make sure the supreme court stays batshit conservative for decades to come, and reverses the few nice things the people got under Obama, like net neutrality and the soon-to-be-revealed [worker overtime pay eligibility rules](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/21/obama-overtime-pay_n_6911808.html). If that means voting for Hillary and not wasting a vote on a write-in, then so be it."

aS'As a Canadian, Bernie Sanders sounds awfully Canadian.\n\nYou Americans might want to seriously think about electing this guy.'
p514
aS"Bernie Sanders is not the first progressive. I do not think anyone is suggesting that.\n\nThe fact that hiliary is 11th  says she is not a progressive. John Kerry is ranked 15th.  Durbin is 14th. Kerry is centrist and Durbin is widely seen as a conservative democrat.  Clinton is closer to these senators than Sanders. Her positions are largely identical to her husband, who supported many free trade deals which progressives opposed.\n\nLets be clear on this: Clinton has never been progressive. She served six years on the board of walmart. No one can argue that she is friends with walstreet and has close ties with many corporations.\n\nEven if you were right (which I don't think you are), why would I want to choose an 11th ranked progressive over a progressive ranked 1st? If I am a progressive, I want to support the most progressive candidate that supports my issues."
p515
aS"Apparently Reddit doesn't care. The guy's behind by 50 points in the polls and is saying he's going to be even more liberal than Obama. Well guess what? Congress blocked every single one of those progressive agenda items. Now Sanders is going to magically take the lead, win the presidency, form a coalition in Congress and work with Republicans (because that's the only way to get a bill passed) to pass everything Redditors want?\n\nGive me a break. \n\nUsually at least one or two comments in these threads has somebody explaining the reality of the situation but recent Bernie Sanders threads are completely devoid of any reason."

aS"Actually I'm right there with you. The numbers are from 2009 onward indicating the wealth accrual. Granted, the numbers have been settling that way for far longer than Obama, but he hasn't done much to change the course.\n\nThis is why as much as I love what Sanders is saying, I'm not convinced anything big will change. Whatever his ideological stances and I have no doubt they're honest, no single person can change the systematic take-over of power by the modern oligarchy. Which is what the original article's analysis goes into."
p520
aS"That's not how that works. Independents don't run with democrats. Sanders declared himself democrat to run in the primary. Independents aren't a unified group. They align wherever they want to. Closer to left or right depending in the person."
p521
aS'He can appeal, but the real question is can he get their vote. Too often people like what they hear, but worry that giving their vote to someone not "mainstream" means they are throwing their vote away. For that reason alone sort of proves what Sanders is saying is absolutely true. Vote with your heart, your gut and stay true to what you believe is never throwing away your vote.'
p522
aS"&gt;Sanders labels himself a socialist and will shed light on what that actually means in debates unlike previous politicians who treat it like a political cuss word.\n\nKind of. Speaking as a socialist, he isn't the revolutionary type. He believes in slow, methodical reforms to the system. So, he's more of a social democrat, like those in Sweden and other places, than a socialist. His views towards Israel and Palestine are still rather conservative. He believes in a two-state solution and kept avoiding having to admit the bad deeds that Israel has done in a town hall meeting. I don't recall what the video was, but I suggest searching it up."
p523
aS'&lt; Sanders has long warned against prescriptions that would cut benefits or slow their growth, upending Washingtons consensus that government needs to cut entitlement programs to keep them sustainable.

aS"Its not about getting things done for the sake of getting things done, the path we are headed on is towards oligarchy so the idea is to get us off that path. Sanders isn't just saying what we want to hear, he is telling the truth. Sanders if given enough airtime can potentially inspire people to vote in large enough numbers that we can turn things around. He is our best hope to do that, no one is saying it will be easy. Obama like Hillary was funded by Wall street, so in a sense he was always a trojan horse. His biggest accomplishment was the ACA a program based off of one implemented by a Republican Governor. Now he is trying to ram the TPP through congress. Bernie Sanders is not like Obama, there is no chance he will betray the people who voted for him the way Obama has."

p531
aS"Here is the thing that concerns me with this election. The right is already refraining from bashing each other and are crusifying Clinton. Sanders is now starting in on her too. To date the only person having attacks thrown at them is Clinton from the right and left. \n\nIf Sanders doesn't win, which is a high likely hood, Clinton will be facing a challenger who hasn't had the same attack adds thrown at them for the past year. \n\nThere are at least 2 Supreme Court justices up for retirement and the next president will likely impliment them. Considering the conservative dream team has passed such golden rulings as the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, gutting the birthcontrol mandate in the Hobby Lobby case because of factually incorrect opinions, and Citizens United I'd say it's pretty god damn important more conservative justices don't get implimented. \n\nSanders knows that this is our reality which is also likely why he isn't running as an independant. It is possible to run a successful campaign based on one's own platform without having to join the right in their attacks against Clinton. \n\nFor anyone that is a pie in the sky idealist: Clinton is likely to win. I wish Sanders would win, but just because reddit likes him doesn't change reality. Many people don't know who he is and many who do don't like that he is a self proclaimed socialist. By running an attack campaign against the likely winner rather than focusing on his own strengths is going to do nothing but seal our fate at a 7 out of 9 strong conservative supreme court. You think things are bad now? People have no idea what a stacked conservative court is like. We haven't seen that since before the 60s"

Bernie was a civil rights leader, he cares more about serving the public than increasing the wealth of the super rich, and he isn't trying to destroy the federal government.\n\nThey are completely different, and should not at all be associated in people's minds.

aS"I'm not saying they're evil, it's just not very impressive when your list is topped out by groups writing $10,000 checks each election cycle. I think if anything, it speaks to the scale of campaign Bernie Sanders has had to run versus the scale that Clinton has run."

That kind of stance won't win him the election, but it may help foster some debate. Don't belittle all other politicians as if what Sanders is doing is noble.

He also introduced the first legislation in the House meant to undo some of the unconstitutional provisions in that bill. In the Senate, Sanders has continued to focus on these and other important civil liberty issues, including reining in the NSA\'s warrantless wiretapping program, restoring habeas corpus rights, controlling the use of wide-sweeping presidential signing statements and putting an end to torture. He has introduced S. 1168, the Restore Our Privacy Act, to amend the PATRIOT Act to curtail overly broad surveillance by the government. He also sent a letter to General Keith Alexander, then-head of the NSA, asking if the NSA spies on Congress.\n-Sanders has proposed legislation to make Election Day a national holiday.\n-Sanders introduced an amendment to the Farm Bill affirming states rights to require labeling of genetically engineered ingredients.\n-Sanders issued a report outlining the Dental Crisis in America and held hearings in February 2012 and September 2013 on access to and the cost of dental care. To address the crisis and improve access to care, Sen. Sanders also introduced S.1522, the Comprehensive Dental Reform Act."\n\nSeriously man... it took me a few seconds. If nothing here is good enough for you then you don\'t understand the depth of the political process. Proposing legislation, getting it out there, is half the battle. I could say the same thing about most politicians except for the fact they\'d be lobbying for Corporate (backed by billions of dollars) instead of something like dental health care for the people (with little financial support).

That's enough to sway the conversation greatly, not only in the 2016 election, but in regards to opening up the public to new avenues of thought in regards to political advancement. \n\nThe Progressive parties of the early 1900's set the stage for the Golden Age of Progressivism (Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, la Follette, and later acolytes of the movement such as FDR), it's worth noting that we might be witnessing a similar generational shift in the present day.\n\n"

They're not. A heavy concentration of her donations are coming from a very specific sector- one that does not account for a (relatively) large number of New Yorkers. This reflects (1) the massive amounts of money present in these institutions and (2) Hillary's evident sympathies for those types of institutions.  Both points give me reason enough to vote for Bernie Sanders.\n\n[Source](https://labor.ny.gov/stats/nys/Largest-private-sector-employers-NYS.xls) Note: The list above also doesn't include public sector jobs which account for even more people who are not represented in Hillary's donor list.\n\nYou *can't* write off her donor records entirely as a product of being from New York State. The fact is she receives a very large part of her money from the very people who pose the most dangerous and imminent threat to the stability of our country and our economy.

Worse, [they have only gotten bigger](http://fortune.com/2013/09/13/by-every-measure-the-big-banks-are-bigger/) so our economy only relies more on they're small point of failure.\n\nBernie Sanders is running on a platform of breaking these institutions up in defense of our nation's economy.

In the end, life is one long reelection campaign for most of them, until they make a big enough name for themselves to go work for one of their bigger lobbyists.\n\nI think the reason that I, as someone who avoids Democrats and Republicans generally, am so excited about Bernie Sanders is that he seems as if he couldn\'t possibly care less about appealing to the latest fad or changing his stance to gain votes.

aS"He most certainly would. Most politicians that run for president don't expect to win. They expect to be heard and change the debate. Bernie is running cause he doesn't want to see a coronation, he wants to see real debates. He made sure to get his voice out first (Clinton announced first, but Sanders has voiced his policy first) so that when Clinton does lay out her policy it needs to be further left than Clintons team may have preferred. Bernie knows that Clinton is the best thing that has happened to the Democrat party in a long time. Her win is pretty much guaranteed. He knows that, and he hopes that his campaign can push her a bit.\n\nJust because progressive policies support the middle class, doesn't mean they are popular within the middle class. And many don't see his policies as helpful to the middle class, but rather just helpful to those of low income. Social democratic policies have been unpopular in the U.S. Because they are often viewed as handouts to the lazy, rather than support for the less privileged.

It means nothing beyond letting me know that you understand how the political process currently works. But the fact of the matter is, we are not studying physics, or chemistry, or mathematics. Politics are not something which will always be the same, and we as people are the direct creators of politics. We, therefore, have the ability to change the system in any way we so choose.

Smear campaigns are quickly forgotten, especially smear campaigns in the primaries. But either way, people aren't smearing Clinton nearly as much as you seem to believe they are. Calling out facts is not smearing someone. Saying that someone doesn't have stances on an issue, takes huge donations from big banks, or that they do not personally like her as a candidate is not smearing her.\n\nOn the supreme court issue, you are correct, but that changes nothing. People who are voting for Sanders in the primary aren't suddenly going to turn around and vote Republican, and the issues that Sanders brings to light may even help increase voter turnout should Clinton be nominated. We need to stop putting the cart before the horse here and just support the candidate that we personally feel is best without trying to line up a ridiculous strategy with essentially no information on which to base that strategy."

Sanders is pretty much the only guy in the game who actually wants to do something about it that has a chance of being effective.

However, his agenda is to preserve American democracy even if it also means preserving the core of American capitalism.  \n\nWhat makes him a "democratic socialist" is that he would save our corporate dominated system by applying policies that infuriate the shortsighted half-wits lounging atop America\'s plutocratic establishment.  He may not be a true socialist who wants to democratize property itself, but he is as much a socialist as one can be without supporting rebellion against the existing political system.'

aS'It\'s not that sanders is a bad candidate, I think it\'s good to have someone who can present some far left ideas and force discussion on issues. \n\nBut people here are just completely buying in to his propaganda. Saying shit like "we need a political revolution against Wall Street!" means literally nothing. It is incredibly vague, nonspecific rhetoric that plays into people\'s hatred of the "ultra rich". It is not proposing specific programs or reforms, or informing at all about how he wants to implement any change. It\'s just nonspecific rhetoric designed to get people who hate billionaires worked up. And it\'s working spectacularly well among the viewing audience in /r/politics. \n\nSo again, don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t dislike sanders at all. But it\'s just sad to watch people gobble up his PR team\'s bullshit rhetoric and not maintain perspective and see it for what it is. I\'m not saying his positions on issues are good, but people are just working themselves up into a frenzy, eating up his hyperbolic rhetoric and they\'re going to be sorely disappointed when they realize it\'s just campaigning. \n\nSo again, I don\'t disagree with many of Sanders viewpoints. But my issue is that, thus far, he has not really said or done anything that would inspire me with confidence that he can be an effective leader. He has proven to be adept at releasing hyperbolic, sensationalist quotes that play very well with people who dislike big banks and the ultra rich (i.e. most of /r/politics) but I have yet to see him say anything that makes me feel like he has a realistic plan for enacting achievable reform since all we\'ve heard from him is sweeping generalizations like "revive the middle class! hold the rich accountable!". Those kind of things test well and get people excited about him, but do not give any indication that he had the realistic capability of making positive change. \n\nPeople criticize Obama for talking big but then being unable to actually make changes, Bernie Sanders is talking 100x bigger and providing me with even less confidence that he\'ll be able to make effective change.

And here is a link to [his complete voting record](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/bernie_sanders.htm), where you can see how he\'s voted on various important issues. \n\nAs the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veteran\'s Affairs, Bernie Sanders is one of the Congress\'s strongest supporters of strengthening veteran\'s benefits.  In 2014, he sponsored [Senate bill S.1982](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1982) to expand veteran\'s medical benefits (although this was [procedurally killed by the Republicans](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/199480-gop-blocks-veterans-bill) for being "too expensive", which I personally find infuriatingly outrageous).  \n\nBased on Sanders\' platform and voting history, I think that military veterans would get a level of support they\'ve never had before from a Sanders administration.  He\'s consistently voted against unnecessary and pre-emptive wars and has never failed to demand that we compensate veterans for serving in America\'s wars.  I think it is safe to say that the military has no better friend in the Senate.'

Do you really think that the American voting population is educated enough to make decisions for itself? No, of course not. When many people hear Democratic Socialist, they think about the good old USSR and communists. Bernie needs to lure them in with things that they want to hear. Its definitely a process, and until he builds name recognition and people start to get over his label, he won't have a chance. How does Bernie Sanders gain followers without being provocative and popular? Sure its all PR, but that doesn't mean he doesn't believe in what he says and doesn't have specific plans to implement change. When we get to the debates and candidates are asked specific questions, we'll get specific answers. Until then, its all about awareness. But if you do want some specifics, please feel free to read any of his [341 sponsored bills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357) and I think you'll be able to see how he specifically wants to change the country.

Honestly, I\'d probably vote for him.\n\n&gt;Sure its all PR, but that doesn\'t mean he doesn\'t believe in what he says and doesn\'t have specific plans to implement change.\n\nI completely agree, and I believe Sanders is a quality candidate. My comment is not a knock on Sanders at all, just on Reddit\'s hypocritical and naive response to the media articles that are posted.\n\nI\'m not talking about Sanders speeches or his viewpoints as a whole, I\'m talking about specifically the Sanders related content on Reddit. While you\'re right that Sanders himself does give much more fleshed out perspectives, a VAST majority of the posts about him on Reddit are 1-2 sentences or sensationalist rhetoric and a link to an article that 99% of the commenters do not read.\n\nThat\'s my issue, that people here on Reddit are praising this guy based on these blatantly propagandist quotes about "fighting the big guy" and "staging a revolution". There is little to no rational discussion about Sanders as a politician or any realistic talk about what kind of changes and reforms he could potentially push for if elected. It\'s just a classic /r/politics circlejerk about "tax the rich! hold wall street accountable!", and people are praising Sanders unquestioningly and without a sufficiently rational or reasonable perspective on both his stances on issues and the current political climate in which he would be forced to try to launch reform from.\n\nIt\'s just frustrating seeing people follow him like sheep based on the sensationalist article headlines that are posted here, especially when /r/politics spends so much time criticizing the voting populace (especially right-wing voters) for being ignorant and blindly believing right-wing propaganda. They\'re just doing the exact same thing, except now it\'s acceptable to be sucked into the media\'s propaganda as long as their propaganda fits in with Reddit\'s anti-rich, anti-establishment left-wing narrative.\n\n'

aS"EXACTLY.  Why do these different economic models have to be applied at the federal level?  If Bernie Sanders is a socialist, he should run for governor of Vermont and try to make a people's state of Vermont!  If Vermont ends up being a success, more states will follow their lead and people will move away from right wing states, like Texas, to move to Vermont.  If another state wants to be a corporate oligarchy, that is fine too.  America is a very very diverse place. Scandinavia has been homogenous for centuries.  Sure, you can get a few million people with very similar backgrounds to agree on things.  Try to get folks from Texas, the deep south, San Fran, Seattle, the Midwest, etc.. To agree on the same form of economy.  It won't work without a very authoritarian, hares, government.  "

aS"That automatic registration law out of OR is fantastic! I'd love to see more states institute that. Sanders has already, among a few others, called for making voting day a national holiday, though holidays only effect certain portions of the populace and not always those who can actually take time off.\n\nYour frustration with Obama is certainly warranted. People definitely wanted him to be more a bulldog and similar is now expected of Sanders. Unfortunately the scenario ends up being that Obama gets elected, then with the incumbency being what it is he has little to work with and since the populace is so masochistic about politics they don't vote people into office who truly care to make changes, though it's difficult to blame the populace when the people who truly care can't actually even run.\n\nI'd love to see a fundamental change to the election system, where there's no more life-time pay after leaving office, where it's completely public funded and candidates have to work with the same amount of money so ideas matter.\n\nI'm with you, a dramatic change is needed.

Plus what the person is complaining about "propaganda" is not what Sanders is about. \n\nSo my point is - don\'t buy their premise (that it\'s "propaganda" not agenda and that we have to change the topic to their topic) Also don\'t buy in to trying to silence people about what the agenda actually is.  I think it is a retreat and also to be concerned with personality traits like whether he has charisma or whether Hillary is more of a "populist" than Jeb Bush is even less about the actual issues.  \n\nWhat he\'s talking about is basic fairness for people who do the work and their families.\n\n'

GOP will stonewall him in a way that will make Obama's frustration look like a kindergarten brawl. His very own party will be alienated. \n\nThe Dems may be more pro-regulation and progressive, but they're also politicians, nobody likes a radical and everyone has their own lobbyists that they have to appease. Bernie Sanders doesn't have the power to bend the whole party to his will. He will flounder and break down. He's too old anyway to be the reformer that he claims to be. Reforms like these take superhuman effort and devotion of time and energy. Won't work even if he was a much more influential politician than he is now. \n\nBernie Sanders is just going to hand the next election to a Republican and serve a single unproductive term.

aS'No. Certainly a third party candidate in a system like ours does have the potential to harm the political candidate from a mainstream party that is closest to them, but the bigger issue for Gore was that many Democrats were very frustrated with Bill Clinton\'s neoliberal third way policies and Gore campaigned as a continuation of that, not as a left candidate. All of his climate change activism didn\'t come until after the election was over. At that time was also the height of the fair trade/anti-glob protests, which started under Clinton and were much larger and more intense than occupy. Meanwhile, George Bush was campaigning as a centrist, nothing like how he ended up once in power. So, Gore lost voters since less turned out to vote and even some registered Democrats voted for Bush, maybe thinking he would roll back on the neoliberalism (nothing to do with "liberal" as used in the US). More registered Democrats voted for Bush than Nader. And iirc, quite a few registered Republicans voted for Nader (meaning their votes didn\'t go to Bush, so in that case, they weren\'t helping Bush by voting for Nader).\n\nAlso, Sanders is running under the Democratic Party, not Independent (as he is in Vermont).

Total dollar expenditures are not an indicator of success, but in the Dem primary I see it being much more difficult for Sander\'s small donor approach to raise enough money to be able to match what Hillary can spend having courted large donors.

aS"&gt;Sanders says elections should be serious debates over serious issues. He takes pride in never having aired a single negative ad, as well he should. There may be another politician of equivalent rank who can make that boast, but for the life of me I dont know who it is. Democrats have come to believe that the politics we have is the politics we must have. They think vicious personal attacks, innocuous ads and empty catch-phrases are the only way to fight.\n\n&gt;Sanders can teach todays progressives how to be more like their forebears, who won elections and historic reforms by prosecuting their cases with fact and logic. Sanders is bright and articulate enough to pull it off. In so doing he could redefine what it means to be a candidate. He might even persuade a few folks that calculation and charisma count for less than intelligence, character and conviction.\n\nI'd love to see him pull off an upset, but even if he doesn't, it will still be a huge step if he can change the way campaigns are run."

aS"When it comes to any sort of financial intermediary that enables political corruption in the U.S., it's a problem.  Regardless of the good work that the Clinton Foundation does around the world, any financial intermediary that breaches the arms length relationship which every politician should maintain with special interest groups is wrong.\n\nAs Bernie Sanders has pointed out, this is not a problem that is unique to the Clinton Foundation.  It's merely part of a MUCH larger problem...widespread political corruption.  Unfortunately, this corruption has reached the point where it is now systemic.  We have no other choice but to dismantle that structure in order to restore the Democratic representation which every American deserves to enjoy in the U.S.\n\nQuite frankly, the only way to avoid even the appearance of corruption is to completely separate policy makers from those who benefit from their decisions while in office.  Their retirement such be sufficiently lucrative (*and* potentially punitive) to prevent the possibility of corruption in office or thereafter.  Influence peddlling should be outlawed entirely. "

He certainly didn't blame the cost of tuition on the rich, not sure how you interpreted that."
p694

aS'No he doesn\'t.  His record speaks for itself.  He\'s been proving he\'s a progressive throughout his political career.\n\nAs I said elsewhere in this thread, if you doubt Sen. Sanders\' progressivism, read up on him.  Check out his page on [ontheissues.org](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Bernie_Sanders.htm).  Check out some of his speeches on [his Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SenatorSanders).\n\nIf you doubt his commitment to progressive causes, it\'s because you have not attempted to educate yourself about his policy stances and causes he\'s fought for over the course of his political career.\n\n&gt;But big time politics, national, requires a more nuanced politics\n\nBernie Sanders has campaigned in as many elections as "Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama combined."  That\'s literally in the first paragraph of the article.  Sen. Sanders is experienced in campaigning, and he\'s won many races that his detractors claimed were impossible for him to win.'

Check out [his Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SenatorSanders).\n\n&gt;I know you probably feel strongly about him, but just let me have my opinion.\n\nNot if your opinion is blatantly wrong.\n\nSo, who's your candidate if not Hillary or Bernie ([currently the top two Democratic candidates](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/yougov-economist-22090))?"

Instead he\'s going to argue policy and policy alone. That\'s going to be very refreshing. \n\nThe Democratic nomination could end up being a very civil argument over policy, which would help unify the Democratic Platform. \n'

aS"You act like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton didn't say those exact same things in 2008. You must be very young. Every presidential candidate spews those exact talking points. No one has any reason to believe Bernie Sanders is any different, and you're going to be hard pressed to get tens of millions of Americans to see him as anything but another old, rich white man. "
p700
aS"I've been involved in the Democratic Party for years, mostly on the state level, I supported Obama less than a week after he announced, I don't particularly care for Clinton but sanders fans right now are coming off extremely unknowledgeable about the political climate he's trying to step into. A major part of Obama winning in 2008 was he was able to win Iowa off of oration and a brilliant background in community organizing (particularly helped in caucuses which he did better in) and he was plugged in enough to peel off super delegates from Clinton. Ted Kennedy might have been so important that it won him the nomination in all honesty. Sanders has had virtually no backing from inside the party like Obama did, he's not even been a democrat before now and super delegates matter a lot, he's popular among young progressives in the party but that's about where his reach ends, could he theoretically build up a name? I suppose so, but he's much more likely to flame out. To me and to be completely harsh he seems like a less electable Elizabeth Warren. He's not the first candidate to run on positions like he's currently running. Dennis kuchinich ran on many similar issues and never gained real traction. Sanders would be considered on the far end of American politics, that's not who usually gets the nomination. Romney, McCain, Obama all have been more centered politicians, granted bush wasn't and you can argue Kerry wasn't though I think an argument could be made either way, bill Clinton certain was, as was al gore. It's hard for more liberal or more conservative candidates to get a nomination, not impossible but difficult, bush was able to do it with a great family name, dirty campaigning especially against McCain in the primary, and Karl rove. \n\nI don't have a problem supporting a candidate fervently, I do think it's better to be realistic however. I also see a growing dissent for Hillary saying if she wins won't vote for her, which to me is dangerous. No she isn't perfect and had major problems but she would be much better than any republican who's announced especially with the Supreme Court possible in the balance. Sanders isn't polling very well at the moment, and has an uphill climb that in all honesty is unlikely, and that's just the primary not even getting into the general. "

p703
aS"Also, Sanders has jumped up 3 points in the latest poll. Given the swell of grassroots support (he raised $1.5 million from 35,000 donors the first day of his campaign), I don't think you can write him off so quickly. Sanders and his supporters are well aware he has an uphill fight, but we're not willing to count him out yet. Even if his chances are slim, he certainly has a shot at beating Hillary (especially if she agrees to debate him)."

p708
aS'Bernie Sanders is completely different. he\'s the living embodiment of "walking the walk." Look at his record as a Senator, to the fact that he\'s refusing to have a Super PAC because he doesn\'t want big corporate donations tainting him. \n\nAmerica is finally becoming more accepting of progressive values. A guy like Bernie Sanders will find a very receptive Democratic primary. \n\nAnd i\'m tired of 20-somethings and 30-somethings already resigned to the fact that "it doesn\'t matter, they\'re all the same. there\'s nothing we can do about it." Yes we can. But if we choose to do nothing, then your self-fulfilling prophecy is correct. \n\nIt\'s past time that people our age begin to fight for what we believe in, because I know I\'m sick and tired of listening to cowards and armchair political analysts saying that nothing can change. \n\nChange comes when the next generation is sick of what the old generation failed to do. Martin Luther King was not even 40 when he was assassinated. The backbone of the civil rights movement was young students and young Americans who put their lives on the line for change. And they made something happen. \n\nSo what are you going to do about it? \n\n\n'

And there of plenty of reasons to believe Sanders is different. Unlike Obama and Clinton, he does not accept contributions from corporations or banks. His [top donors](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8522019/bernie-sanders-hillary-donors) are mostly unions, while Clinton's are Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.

And people like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are in a perfect position to force our girl Hilary to the left, where she needs to be. '

p721
aS"I think you're safe. Obama had only a few years of federal legislative experience behind him, which meant that his rhetoric, while inspiring, was also empty. He allowed people to project their own progressive desires onto his campaign.\n\nSanders has been in Congress for many years. He's done so outside of the two-party system for the entirety of his service. He's been consistent (and consistently amazing) throughout his entire career. He supported gay marriage back in the 90s. He opposed Iraq and the Patriot Act right off the bat. He is projecting his *own* progressive desires onto his campaign and allowing people to see that, and that makes him manifold more trustworthy and predictable than Obama ever was. If he actually went moderate upon winning the race, I'd probably eat my own shoes out of sheer shock and adopt the Bill Hicks notion that Presidents are forcefully controlled by a small room of conspiring, cigar-smoking movie mafiosos."
p722
aS"I'm curious--what issues matter to you? What voting record are you looking for in that moderate republican? How do you want your candidate to vote? \n\nSanders has touched on many issues that are important to me and I agree with his stances on many of them. I am an average working class american--not just some idealist redditor. "
p723
aS'Sanders has a track record, unlike what presidential candidate Barack Obama had. I have much more confidence in Sanders sticking to his guns, than Obama. Obama worked with the political capital he had, but sometimes I felt he stepped down from issues he could have won. I believe Sanders will fight continuously to achieve what he believes to be right.'
p724
aS"This is both fortunate and unfortunate. Of course, socialist Sanders shalln't win. The problem is socialism requires government power to compel the unwilling masses onto the Progressive plantation. Without coercion, without a massive state policing Progressive compliance, socialism will remain locked forever in university faculty lounges and in the dark recesses of fringe politicians. "
p725
aS"The risk with a 3-party Sanders would've been splitting the democratic vote, leading to a republican president"
p726
aS"The headline seems very subversive. It's like the author wants to convince people that the excitement surrounding Sanders is independent of his ability to win, which might lead people not to vote for him; we all know how desperate people are to lend implicitly hollow support to whoever's going to end up winning (as long as it's not the bad guy).\n\nI guess the headline readers will get a different take-away from the article readers. I can see that being by design."
p727
aS'The author of the article says "He relies more on logic than charm  and everyone hes met says thats the right call." Instead of blowing hot air and making general buzz word/ issue statements, he\'ll bring facts and logic which is something we haven\'t seen in American politics for a while. Also, because he\'s not accepting any PAC cash, cooperations won\'t be swaying his votes if he makes it into office as it could with candidates that do. Hilary could say the same things Sanders would say but I don\'t think she could back it up with the facts and logic Sanders has. She would probably dance around the issue as most politicians do. I think the point is Sanders is going to make these other candidates put their mouth where their money is. That is something we haven\'t seen in a long time and will definitely change the tone of the debates.'
p728
aS"Oh sure, I won't disagree with you that those are all actual issues, but how do those differentiate him from the other potential democratic candidates? The answer is they don't. His big issue is finance reform. At least, that is what you will hear about in news articles mostly.\nThere are even a few moderate Republicans who are for some of those issues. With the exception of corporations, you will hear the same arguments from Clinton. If Warren decides to run, and that's a big if, you will hear those exact same issues coming from her. You're going to hear those same issues from O'Malley as well. My question is, so what? I like Sanders and all, I do. But it doesn't change that he is way more liberal than what America wants. \n\nForgetting his age for a moment, the main problem is that Sanders wants more regulation. A lot more government regulation. Whether it's drugs, climate change, education, the IRS, unions, health care, raising the minimum wage, Sanders is all for more regulation. And voters HATE that. He's a socialist through and through and you will hear that again, and again, and again. You will mostly hear it from the media. You will hear it from republican pundits. You will hear it from people who have NO CLUE what it is, but there is such a negative connotation that is associated with socialism it will instantly put skeptical cynicism into those who do not know much about him. \nIt also doesn't help that Sanders is being heavily funded by unions. Sure there are those, like myself, who really support unions and everything they do. I strongly believe that people are better off paying union dues and being in one. But right to work laws are tense issues, and the moment someone says he is being funded by unions it could quickly turn off moderate voters. \n\nAgain, everything you listed are issues. I agree with you on that. But that doesn't make him special. You can't run on the democratic ticket in the 2016 election without saying you will fight climate change, or raise the minimum wage, or support the unions, or pay equity. You simply can't. "

aS"Bernie Sanders is running for president.  You're deluded if you don't think he could beat whatever clown wins the Republican primary."
p730
aS"I don't think people understand how politics work.  The president is not a dictator.  \n\nObama would have gotten universal healthcare if he was a dictator, but Congresspeople actually have to pass the laws, meaning the best he could do was to leverage the bargaining power of the insurance industry against rising medical costs.\n\nIt is far from a perfect solution, but that's politics.  Even if Bernie Sanders was elected president, it's not like he could turn the US into a democratic socialist utopia overnight.  \n\nBut he'd make incremental, concrete steps toward a better nation, which is waaaaay better than having a Republican in office who would actively destroy everything and sell off America piece by piece to the super wealthy like Bush did and like this Congress is trying to do.  \n\nYou should be cynical enough to see how things work, but not so cynical that you stop taking concrete steps to make things better."

aS"Not to get all hipster on you, but as someone who's followed Sanders a while, I agree. I'm happy Sanders has attracted such a following and I will shed tears of joy if this ends up getting him elected, but it really can scare people away."
p735
aS'I agree completely with his social views but the one thing that I cannot agree with is the he assumes the all business is bad and that ALL people who have accrued wealth have done so by cheating other people out of it which are simply untrue, though there are some who have. So if he were more friendly to the average person being able to do business in an ethical manner I might possibly see eye to eye with him a bit more.  I can see why Warren Buffett who is very apolitical usually and who donates vast amounts of his wealth stands with Hillary. \n\nAdditionally while Mr. Sanders blames other politicians from taking money from enormous business corporations he himself takes money from massive organized labor corporations. So is taking money from the AFL-CIO any less of a special interest than say Halliburton? I think not. And this only goes to show that his anti-business stances will continue and will be detrimental to young entrepreneurs like myself who are trying to go into business with very little resources. '
p736
aS"It makes him special because unlike Clinton, he isn't a damn shill. If you want more of what Obama gave us - false promises, mass surveillance, torture, secrecy, assassinations... Vote for Clinton. You'll get more of the same. \n\nIf you want actual progressive change, vote for Bernie. The guy who speaks sincerely and has a voting record to back it up. Example: Clinton talks tough against the patriot act *now* because it's not popular at the moment. Guess who voted for the patriot act back in October 2001? Clinton. Guess who voted against it every time? Sanders\n\nI'll support Rand Paul because I'm a libertarian, but Sanders is the only genuine-article Democrat running at this point. Let me know if Elisabeth Warren throws her hat in the ring and I'll need to reconsider my vote. Your party has some genuinely great people running for president and leading the party and you disgrace them with staggering ignorance. "
p737
aS"&gt;one thing that I cannot agree with is the he assumes the all business is bad and that ALL people who have accrued wealth have done so by cheating other people out of it which are simply untrue, though there are some who have.\n\nWhere does he say this?\n\nI think you have a misconception about Sen. Sanders.  What he wants is a level playing field, where the deck isn't stacked in favor of wealthy corporations, where corporations don't receive massive welfare checks.\n\nAlso, I think it's only fair to point out that Buffet--a staunch critic of Super PACS--lamented that his money went to Clinton's Super PAC.  Bernie Sanders doesn't even take Super PAC money.  Since Sanders wasn't sure he would run when Buffet donated to Clinton, I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that we could see him switch teams and start betting on Sanders."
p738
aS"I think Sanders is amazing but I hadn't even considered donating to his campaign. Not for any particular reason, it just hadn't crossed my mind, at all.\n\nConsidering I've spent thousands of dollars on video game Kickstarters...

Some polls even had him tied with or beating Clinton, most had him within single digits of her.\n[source](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html#polls) \n\nIn contrast, Sanders is like 60 points behind Clinton, can't/won't raise serious cash, doesn't have the youth and charisma of an Obama, or the novelty/cool of being the first serious black presidential candidate. \n\nSeriously, as a Republican I'm telling you that if you want the White House it has to be Clinton. A Biden or an O'Malley loses by at least 5%, Sanders loses by at least 10% and gets wiped in the electoral college. Look at 1964 when the Republicans nominated hardline libertarian Barry Goldwater, it would be like that in reverse."

aS"As someone who agrees with just about everything Sanders says, and would vote for him in the primary, you're not wrong."
p745
aS'The problem here is expectations. It is hard to convince those less informed because of the "rational expectations" mechanism. People see him as a dark horse candidate, so they expect him to remain a dark horse candidate, especially when the mainstream media continues to label him as such. It is one thing to raise enough money to compete and another to overcome this barrier. Enough force must be applied to change the mindset of the average citizen. \n\nHow can this be done? It is easier said than done. In order to overcome this restriction, enough support must be garnished to outweigh the negative effects of the expectations of the public. I think this is where the grassroots movement comes in. The comments above saying "he could win" counteracts the negative pull of those saying "he can\'t win." Enough people just have to say he can win in order to influence the masses that he actually can. It doesn\'t take believing he can win, rather just saying he can win probably helps him more than sending a small sum of money because it shifts the expectations of the average citizen. It moves him from dark horse to front runner in the minds of those who hear you say it if they hear enough people say it.\n\nTL;DR Bernie Sanders is going to win. Tell everyone you know.\n\n'

aS'The difference is Ron Paul was popular because he was contradicting the Republican message. Sanders is going in the other direction, away from the centre.'

aS"Wait I'm confused, do people on reddit actually think Sanders has a chance of winning or are you guys just supporting him so that he can get his message heard?"

p749
aS"No, Bernie Sanders is actually quite anti-Fed himself, though not as much as Ron Paul.  And he's against the big banks quite aggressively, much more than Ron Paul is (though Paul was against the bail-outs).  Of course the Fed and the big banks aren't the same entity.  The big banks are actually themselves different entities.  (My post didn't suggest otherwise.)  Though, in effect, the Fed and the banks usually act in unison, especially with regard to Congress."

aS"Ummm because you have to pay taxes if you want to create a socialist utopia like denmark. \n\nSanders' platform sounds great until you look at the countries he is inspired by. \n\nWho cares anyways? Sanders has almost zero chance of winning the primary. He has zero chance of winning the general election. "
p752
aS"You have to pay taxes wherever you live, at least in the developed world. I don't think Sanders is advocating a 50% tax rate and if he did it'd be on the very high earners, not normal people."
p753
aS'Yes, he had 6% support based on polls from *over a month before he had even announced his candidacy*. The reality is, I anticipate seeing more and more polls in the coming months where his popularity will be trending sharply upwards. \n\nDrawing in 1.5 million in your first day of campaigning (with virtually no money with which to announce your campaign on a large scale) is a pretty big sign to me. Mark my words, Bernie Sanders is a Black Swan. '

p755
aS"&gt; Whether it's drugs, climate change, education, the IRS, unions, health care, raising the minimum wage, Sanders is all for more regulation. And voters HATE that. \n\nNot true at all. Voters saw what happens when we have too little regulation like the mortgage backed security derivatives crisis illustrated.\n\nThe only people that hate more regulations are Wall Street and some shady business owners like the Koch brothers. The majority of the voting population benefits far more from regulations that protect them than unregulated messes that costs tax payers billions of dollars due to profiteers."
p756
aS'If you look at his actual positions on the issues in comparison to what Obama ran on in 2008 they\'re pretty similar. Obama by all accounts was considered too progressive to be elected then and it ended up happening. However, you could argue that Obama ran during the perfect time for a perceived progressive candidate to run since people were so tired of Bush, and people tend to vote for a candidate of the challenging party when the incumbents approval ratings are low. That same effect could end up hurting Sanders in 2016 if people look to the Republican Party for change. \n\nAlso, if you look at our history, Sanders is actually not that much of a radical in comparison to past presidents. It\'s just that the Democratic Party has moved so far to the right in the past 30-40 years that he looks much more extreme. For instance, FDR had many of the same beliefs about the "super rich" and income inequality that Bernie has.'
p757
aS"Sanders is basically a unicorn in American politics because Vermont is so small (both in terms of population and geographically) that you don't have to have a ton of financing to get name recognition.  Vermont was one of the few states where what he's done was even possible.\n\nNow he's on the national stage, he has a long, persuasive, and progressive track record, and he's getting a ton of support through the internet.  I love it that our biggest champion of in Congress is starting to shape the Democratic primaries."
p758
aS'You\'ve injected "feminism" into this conversation for no good reason. Is Sanders talking about feminism? No. Is HRC talking about feminism on that rating? No. Did I say feminism was "social justice extremism"? No. Did I mention feminism at all? Nope.\n\nBut since you\'ve baited me, I\'ll give you a response on the assumption that you think I\'ve called feminism "social justice extremism".\n\nIn a proper world? No, feminism is not "social justice extremism". But online and in the world of college activists, feminism has been co-opted as a term by a huge variety of different social justice groups, some of the most vocal of which are extreme in their positions.\n\nIt\'s dumb because it gives feminism a bad name. I say this as a supporter of equality. Like many others, I feel the need to distance myself from "feminism", particularly online, because it has picked up a lot of baggage.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter if that\'s not real feminism. It doesn\'t matter if it\'s just a few bad apples. It matters that it\'s tainted people\'s perceptions (again, predominantly online). It matters that people are calling their extreme viewpoints "feminism" because it ruins feminism for everyone else.\n\nMy point is that there are social justice extremists out there. They give the equalit movement a bad name by pushing away potential allies. Are they feminists? No. But some of them call themselves feminists, and it stinks.'

p761
aS"Let's assume Sanders is the Democratic nominee: How will his campaign financing work? Would it even be possible to be competitive by relying solely on a large number of small donations?

p763
aS"I don't understand this attitude, and I'm not even going to vote for Bernie. Why can't people talk about what he has to say? It's little different than listening to someone like Noam Chomsky or Neil de Grasse Tyson, with the difference that Bernie Sanders is actually in the Senate and knows how the halls of power work. Why shouldn't people be obsessed about that?"
p764
aS"I'm curious:\n\n\nDoes this mean we should privatize social security?\n\n\nShould we provide vouchers for people that do not want to attend public school?\n\n\nWhat about all the deregulation that has happened in Sweden?  Is that what president Bernie Sanders wants?\n\n\nWhat about private healthcare?  the government promoting private health insurance?  Private emergency rooms?  Hospitals on the stock market? \n\n\nWhat about privatizing public-transportation?\n\n\nDoes Bernie really want the US to be more like Scandinavia?\n\n\nMy hunch is he actually has no clue what is going on in Sweden - but if he does he gets my vote.\n"

I don\'t believe any other Senator owns that label in the way he does. '

aS"This is just the beginning.   He's Reddit's newest sweetheart and soon his name will be plastered all over the front page for months on end.   He's Ron Paul without all the anti-abortion craziness; the candidate that we wished Ron Paul was.  Polite, level-headed, and progressive.  Sanders was too liberal to win in '08, but after everyone was burned by Obama's cronyism, the CIA drone attacks in Pakistan, and stance on whistle-blowers, people are finally hungry for a politician who isn't a slave to super PACs, and with a voting history that reflects modern,  progressive ideals. "
p769

aS"He is not communist or socialist by any textbook definition. He supports in a Keynesian welfare state, which most republicans do on some level (ie progressive taxation). He is not a Bolshevik or anything and *actual* socialists think Sanders is just a tad bit to the left of Clinton and other Democrats who raise money with donations from Goldman Sach et all. If Sanders proposed a centralized economy, than your simpleton meanderings would make more sense. But he doesn't so you just clearly don't understand much about this stuff. "
p772
aS"So does Bernie Sanders support the privatization that is taking place in Sweden?\n\nWill his first EO be the privatization of social security?  As they have done in Sweden?\n\nIf that's the case.\n\nGo Bernie Go!"

aS'Sanders is well to the left of Obama (who is not on the left at all, IMO). He, for instance, knows you guys have the right healthcare system, whereas Obama abandoned rational solutions for healthcare (like Medicare for All) as soon as he became a national figure. On the other hand, Obama capitulated enough to big donors and corporate power enough to win; Sanders has no chance and is doing this to get his message out. I am glad he is because he will be a nice counter to Clinton, but I think it is nave to think a long-shot primary run will spearhead change. Change comes with actual resistance (organizing, civil disobedience, etc... not a Democratic Party primary. '
p775
aS'Ron Paul wanted to go back to the Gold Standard, weaken unions, cut all student aid etc... the only things these politicians have in common is that represent a challenge to the status quo -- but on policy that have little in common. I guess maybe they might share some ideas on foreign policy, but even on that Sanders is not much of an advocate against the horrors of US foreign policy as he is on economic issues. He basically just  votes the way the party whips him on any close vote relayed to foreign policy. '
p776
aS'Ron Paul is a libertarian, which is nonsense. Sanders is a social democrat / democratic socialist, which is not nonsense. This is the difference.'
p777
aS"Man, I had hope in the electoral realm once. I remember in 2006 when the Dems took the House and Senate and promised to end the war. They passed a non-binding resolution and enabled that war crime by funding it. Then there was Obama. I had grown skeptical by then, but his failure to be progressive in the slightest way was eye opening: Survellience, abandoning the Employee Free Choice Act, appointing DLC types to his Cabinet, expanding the war in Afghanistan, invading Libya without approval from Congress; abandoning the Public Option.\n\nI am in my 30s. I feel voting is not a real catalyst for change. Don't get me wrong: I will vote for Sanders, because he is better than Clinton and voting is not hard. But for real change we need to organize and engage in civil disobedience, resistance etc... Again, support Sanders but put hope in the People, not politicians. Hell, even if Sanders won, the Senate would crush any good proposal he made (even if it was made up of mostly Democrats, almost all of them get their funds from the corporations Sanders would seek to rein in). And only a third of the Senate can be replaced every two years ... anyway, I hope Sanders does good. But, and I think he would agree, change is not going to come from within these broken institutions. voting for better people is not enough. We need to change the system from the bottom up. "

aS"Super PAC money doesn't go to candidates. The real name for them is Independent Expenditure Political Committees and under FEC rules and the Citizens United v. FEC case law they can't give money directly to campaigns all they can do is make their own ads for or against a candidate or even an ideology. This is where liberals don't get that Citizens United should stand as it doesn't allow the rich to give infinite money to candidates but all it does is allow anyone to collect donations and use them to make movies or bill boards that must not be in direct coordination with a campaign. And there are even rules as to who can use the names of candidates and whatnot. Coordination with a campaign as a super PAC is illegal. So I don't see where the problem lies. And Sanders does have Super PACs backing him look at Ready for Bernie Sanders. And Buffet despite his investment acumen and knowledge knows nothing of politics. "
p781
aS"I never thought that I would hear of a politician that I liked, let alone felt that I could trust. But, after reading the majority of the posts about this guy, it would seem that Mr. Sanders has done that for me. I'll be honest and say that I really don't know what his stances are, but I can't help but want to be behind this guy just because it seems like he actually has some morals."

aS"I had the same fear as well going into this, but it's slowly being alleviated when meeting people on both sides that are just as attracted to the message. Not going to try and sugar coat it, most his support is on the left, yet there's a surprisng following on the right as well. Want to fix the welfare state? How about we make the economy more rewarding for the lower and middle classes? People who can afford to buy groceries won't need to get food stamps. Want to reduce unemployment? Increase demand for services by giving the lower and middle class the ability to go out to eat more, see a movie, take a vacation, etc. Instead of trickle-down economics, it's pump-priming.\n\nSanders isn't pandering to a base with dog-whistle politics and crazy promises. It's sensible questions, hard truths, and an impressive track record to back it all up. Maybe, just maybe, people have had enough of being taken advantage of by both sides and want something better."

And the Presidency is *not that powerful*. Bernie, *without help in Congress*, will not stop anything. He isn't a silver bullet stopping the werewolf that is corruption. I'm going to repeat that for you because it is critically important to understand. The President of the United States, **without help from Congress**, is not all powerful, and not as effective as far too many make it out to be. Bernie is but one piece of a much larger puzzle, he is not the endgame itself. \n\nWhich of course brings up a really important part to consider. \n\nIf we are all serious about Sanders For President then we need to be serious about a *Congress For Sanders*. We need to eventually have a list of who is running, their State/District/record/etc. and accompany this information alongside the SFP plugs. Because Congress is arguably more important than the Presidency. Even if people like to think if they vote once every 4 years then they've *done their duty* for democracy."

How? Obama is to the right of him and he can't get Congress to pass a single bill. The only reason we got the mediocre ACA is because we had a democratic house and senate for a few months. Now we have nothing close to that. \n\nWe need somebody in the white house who's a coalition builder and can work with republicans to get things done since they're likely going to try to block any kind of progressive agenda. \n\nReddit needs to realize that the power of the president is limited - all he can do in terms of legislation is pass executive orders which are fairly limited, and direct policy. That means we need a president who has the connections needed to actually get things done.\n\nOtherwise it's going to be business as usual - a democratic president getting behind (barely-)liberal causes and being shut down by a GOP controlled congress.

p803
aS"Running as an independent, you're right. But since he's running as a democrat, he absolutely has a chance to get into the white house.

Besides, it's not just about Sanders getting into the white house. The real goal should be (and seems to be) getting Americans to talk about issues that are incredibly uncomfortable for the upper class.

There is no reason to get preachy about it and don't put people off by being too pushy, but make sure that people you know that only pay attention to major news outlets are informed that Bernie Sanders is a real option and deserves their support, because they won't be told that by traditional election coverage.

Clinton is running with the support of the dem establishment, her husband's connections, and a more moderate tone (meaning, very broadly speaking, she'd get more done in office). "

If there was an American president who wanted to tackle it, this could literally turn politics on its head, as most of the politicians at the moment won't even recognise that the corporate elite running the show is a problem. \n\nThats why I donated 75$ to Sanders yesterday, and why as soon as my exams are done I'm going to write to every American I know urging them to help him out"

I'm not sure that I would've voted for him, but he's the first right-leaning politician whom I've even considered voting for, and I bet he had a good chance of beating Obama had he won his primaries. \n\nSanders is the only truly honest person running right now.

I am glad he is using the presidential race to do that and I am looking for responses from all candidates, because again... these are very important issues.\n\nI hope the candidates take him and the policies and points he brings up very seriously, because it can cost them quite a bit.'

Sanders is too far to the left for most plutocrats to whip out their checkbooks and write large checks. But rather than talking about Sanders\' issues and positions, MSNBC gives us this drivel.\n\nIf Sanders\' campaign does catch on, the media will destroy him (like they did to Howard Dean after his infamous "scream"), or they will bring him to heel and adopt pro-war and pro-corporate positions (like the plutocrats pressured Obama to do in his campaign against Hillary).\n\nThere\'s no surprise or nothing unusual in this. It\'s just plutocratic politics in the US. The surprise is that people stick their head in the sand, ignore the obvious, and pretend that US politics and our 2 ruling parties are actually representative of the people.'

aS'&gt; testament to the power of mindless propaganda.\n\n15 Bernie Sanders links on the front page at one time, and you\'re accusing me of falling victim to propaganda.\n\nI despise the GOP as much as the next guy. I mean it\'s hard not to. Many Democrats are influenced by the same big business, and not all big business is evil. But the thing that I don\'t get is, what exactly is the *solution*? Tax the shit out of them? Make campaigns publicly funded? I agree with the latter, but unfortunately our Supreme Court has deemed that unconstitutional, so it\'s *very* hard to implement. The government protects inefficient monopolies in some industries, but not all of them. I\'m not sure of any company that receives "our tax dollars", I believe most pay taxes even if it\'s arguably less than they should be. \n\nI guess my point is, on /r/politics I see a lot of anti-billionaire, anti-corruption drivel and support for people who speak on those things without actually proposing any real-world solution. Bernie Sanders, for example, is a union whore judging by his funding. Come over to California to see a labor union poster child at work. Once unions get big enough they do just as much for the little guy as the corporations they speak up against. I guess my point is the problem is a lot bigger than just needing to vote for someone who promises to get the rich out of influence. '

Obama is to the right of him and he can't get Congress to pass a single bill.\n\nThis is missing the point. Bernie is not under the illusion that he is some all powerful being, he knows being the President has real limitations. But how do build coalitions with outright obstructionists? You have to instead get people involved once again in the political process.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SmD1RG7u_g&amp;t=8m11s"

I have directly stated that Bernie Sanders **has no clue what is happening in Scandinavia**, which is privatizing not nationalizing.  Bernie Sanders want to nationalize and be a central planner,  Scandinavia is doing the opposite.\n\nThere is privatization happening in Norway as well, with public transportation, or that it prioritizes its economy on the extraction of fossil fuels..  Finland has some pretty awesome gun laws.  Is that the direction Bernie Sanders wants to go?\n\ni doubt it.  So what the feck is Bernie Sanders talking about? He is that much of a moron that he certainly could be president."

aS"You're right, we can't forget about Congress. If the 2016 elections give us a divided government, Sanders, Clinton, whomever, won't be able to accomplish as much. Honestly, neither of them will be able to accomplish anything. We are not working with a responsible Republican party that has shown any interest in actually governing. They'll be more interested in talking about how Sanders is an evil socialist and obstruct him at every turn. They'll be more interested in talking about how Clinton is a traitor that wants to see Americans die on foreign soil. Because that's what they've been saying for years about Clinton. The closest thing the GOP has done to governing is setting up redundant committees investigating the Benghazi ordeal in the hopes of finding evidence that proves their nonsensical conspiracies about Clinton. They already loathe her and have loathed her since Bill was President. Her moderate tone, backing from the Dem establishment and connection with her husband's connections won't change that.\n\nIf the GOP were full people who took governing seriously and were willing to make some compromises in order to accomplish something, we'd see some progress. Small progress, but there'd still be changes. Either candidate could function in that environment; but we, instead, have an environment where there is no loyal opposition, only opposition. Unless the comically far-right Congressmen decide that passing a bill they're not 100% in love with is better than throwing a tantrum and damaging the country, it doesn't matter which Dem wins the nomination or the White House.\n\nA President isn't enough. We need a candidate at the top of the ticket that excites people and boosts turnout and Congressional candidates that hold similar positions."

Unfortunately Obama went back on his pledge to only accept public funding in 2008.  Unfortunately the people in power are the ones who would have to reform this system, and money got them into power.\n\nSanders is the only candidate not backed by the big financial interests, which is why so many of us are rooting for him.

This is something FDR made use of and Sanders would follow. Not to mention the veto.\n\nHe has proven time and again that he is willing to fight for issues that do not seem to have a chance of passing. See the bills he has cosponsored, [here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357).\n\nThe presidency also has a lot of power over things such as NSA spying, trade policy, and constant invasions of foreign countries which are some of his major issues.\n\nOn top of these, there are the numerous potential supreme court slots opening up which would affect U.S. policy for decades.\n\nHim becoming president over any one else would mean a huge difference no matter how much the media and others try to downplay him or marginalize his potential in the office.'

So, I'll make a prediction that if Sanders wins the nomination, Democrats will make substantial gains in the Senate and House, even if Sanders doesn't win the Presidency. However, if Hillary is the nominee, the Dems might not take back the Senate even if she wins the White House."

All are such strong wise people who I am certain will run the country with the benefit of everyone, in all classes, in mind, and not just billionaires. Bernie is dangerous because he doesn't take money from the likes of Kochs or Adleson. How can a candidate be a good leader if he doesn't play by the rules the good ol' boys have established. Sanders says mean things about Citizens United and it hurts my feelings to see him diss rich people, because I will be rich, too someday. We just have to wait for the trickle. Bernie is also mean to governors and corporations that give our jobs to foreigners over seas. He has hangups about not keeping jobs here in America, silly man. He's also bossing the uber rich around telling them it's un American to take their huge profits and stash it over seas to avoid taxes. Can you imagine if these billionaires actually paid taxes like the other classes do?

Most people actually *do* end up leaning, not running full tilt to the extreme of their party.\n\nThis idea that people who vote for moderate candidates are by and large actually being cowed into voting for one of the two major parties because of propaganda and strategic voting (rather than sincerely disagreeing with Sanders) is pretty profoundly arrogant.\n\nI\'m not voting for Sanders because I don\'t agree with Sanders.

aS'http://dissidentvoice.org/Nov06/Smith15.htm\n\n" Despite his own claims, Sanders has not been an antiwar leader. Ever since he won election to the House, he has taken either equivocal positions on U.S. wars or outright supported them. His hawkish positions -- especially his decision to support Bill Clinton\'s 1999 Kosovo War -- drove one of his key advisers, Jeremy Brecher, to resign from his staff. Brecher wrote in his resignation letter, Is there a moral limit to the military violence you are willing to participate in or support?\n\nSo outraged were peace activists over Sanders\' support of the Kosovo War that they occupied his office in 1999. Sanders had them arrested. Under the Bush regime, Sanders\' militarism has only grown worse. While he called for alternative approaches to the war on Afghanistan, he failed to join the sole Democrat, Barbara Lee, to vote against Congress resolution that gave George Bush a blank check to launch war on any country he deemed connected to the September 11 attacks. " This was a piece Ashley Smith originally published in Socialist Worker.'

aS'This kind of passion is fantastic... But what I think many are worried about is that forcing Hillary into a fight for the nomination now is only going to detract from democratic chances in 2016. \n\nMany people don\'t understand the urgency of this election. That\'s understandable - every election is "the most important one" nowadays - but consider this:\n\nCurrently \nRuth Bader Ginsberg is 82\nAnton Scalia is 79\nAnthony Kennedy is 78\nStephen Breyer is 75.\n\nIn 2020/2024,\nRuth Bader Ginsberg will be 87/92\nAnton Scalia will be 84/89\nAnthony Kennedy will be 83/88\nStephen Breyer will be 80/85\n\nIn the next presidential term it is very likely ( a near certainty if re-elected) that we will see 3 or 4 retirements (Ginsberg likely intends to die on the bench and is in great health so hopefully isn\'t going anywhere... Notorious RBG does what she want).\n\nThe pool of qualified lawyers and judges is limited. Hillary and Sanders will likely have similar selections to fill these positions. \n\nHillary is far mor electable than Sanders. I love the guy, have for a while, but part of the reason I love him is because he\'s the closest America has to a socialist, and that makes him unelectable in the here and now - socialist is still a dirty word, as silly as that is. I want to see this change. I want someone with Sanders\'s views to lead the country. But now is not the time to risk it.\n\nThe next president will likely be a foreign policy president - it\'s what we need above anything. Obama\'s domestic agenda is pretty much done, and the economy is in a position that\'s stable. We need a president who will defend that progress and then focus on cleaning up the foreign policy mess that the world is in right now - Hillary Clinton is pretty much the most qualified person do do this (aside from Joe Biden, who\'s just about as honest and respectable as Sanders but is a little more tolerability centrist from a national perspective - please Joe, please run...)\n\nThis is an election that primarily needs a democrat to win because of the SCOTUS appointments approaching - all else is secondary. After that, though, we need someone with foreign policy skills who will give the nation time to acclimate to the thought of more liberal policies in the future. We need time to overcome some of the stigma and propaganda associated with American far-left liberal ideas before we can legitimately run s Sanders. Essentially, we need a domestic care-taker president. Find a young Sanders now and start getting them ready for 2028 or 2032. The country is pushing back against going conservative too quickly - let\'s not jeopardize the opportunities we have now by going liberal faster than the country can stand.\n\n\nExcuse any weird errors - this treatise was typed on a phone...'

p865
aS"He won't be able to. So many of these elections are about charisma and likeability because most American voters don't super care about the actual issues. Obama was able to motivate people because he was great at commanding a room, in fact looking back every president since Regan has had that ability to be larger than life minus Bush sr. and he was the only 1 term president of the bunch.  I'm not convinced Sanders has that charisma. "
p866
aS'No no no....Bernie is so amazing that he convinces people to give up what they have believed for their entire lives and move the the complete opposite end of the political spectrum. \n\nThese seem to be attempts to make Sanders as "cool" as Obama was in 2008. My belief is that people are trying to make Sanders seem like the guy that everyone supports if they just pay attention. I\'m sure that will work on some people, but anyone who has firm political beliefs isn\'t going to be swayed by others talking about how awesome he is without even mentioning policy.\n\nOther subs are already joking about the hilarity of these fake "former-Republicans" who love Sanders now. '
p867
aS"I agree. Ron Paul wasn't very popular amongst republicans. He appealed to libertarians, but didn't really grab the conservative base. \n\nSanders has already gotten a lot of support from democrats and left-leaning independents. And who else is running right now besides Clinton and Sanders? If the primary is kept small, Sanders could get a lot of attention."
p868
aS"&gt; The difference between Sanders and Paul (aside from vastly differing economic ideology) is the base doesn't hate Sanders. Paul got amazingly far with the majority of the Republican base hating him, so I think there's reason to be optimistic about Sanders, even with the comparison to Paul.\n\nI really agree with this. Ron Paul questioned the Republican base. Sanders epitomizes the ideas supported by the Democratic base.\n\nI just can't imagine why a democrat would vote for Clinton over Sanders. She has money and name recognition. But he has integrity, spunk, and a desire to really fix things."

aS'From the article:\n\n*Bernie Sanders isn\'t going to pull her to the left because she was already moving that way. She\'s talking about issues like inequality and criminal justice reform in terms that she might not have used 10 or 20 years ago...Talking about them in more liberal terms isn\'t just good for her in the primaries, it\'s good for her in the general elections.*\n\nNo.  Clinton is not "moving left", she\'s *pretending* to move left, and the source of her campaign contributions is the nail in the coffin of that argument.  Sanders will expose the fact that she\'s basically a corporate stooge who\'s been bought by Wall Street.  She doesn\'t give a dusty fuck about inequality.\n\nSecondly, I\'d like to disagree with everyone who is saying that Bernie\'s campaign is doomed.  He raised more money so far than Republicans have, and the reason for that is he\'s getting people off their asses; those 65% of Americans who disdain the entire political process (justifiably) and refuse to vote altogether because they\'d just be electing another corrupt bigot are realizing there\'s a candidate who actually *does* give a dusty fuck about them.  If we get enough of these disillusioned citizens to vote, Bernie could absolutely win.'
p879
aS'Well, since you ask so nicely.\n\nOverall: The premise is that had Bernie decided to challenge Shumlin for the Gubernatorial office, he could have used that position as a base to build a statewide Progressive Party analogous to the organization he built in Burlington.  That\'s unlikely, and here is why:\n\n- All Vermont politics is intensely personal.  Bernie has a strong *personal* following (he\'s not a nice guy, but he\'s widely seen as honest and straightforward), rather like a fiscally conservative Republican Governor, Richard Snelling.  Snelling was downright rude, abrasive and difficult to deal with.  But he kept getting elected, and when he retired he was succeeded by a liberal Democrat (Madeline Kunin) who proceeded to muck up the budget.  Snelling came back and fixed it again with a stunning deal between him and the powerful Democratic leader of Congress.  It was Snelling\'s unexpected fatal heart attack that put then Lt. Governor Howard Dean - remember him? - into the Governor position.  Dean, brilliantly, immediately announced that he hadn\'t been elected to anything, was going to implement Snelling\'s program and leave Snelling\'s people in place in the government.  Vermonters thought this was pretty classy and re-elected Dean in his own right with a massive majority.  So Vermont had a very fiscally conservative (and rude) Governor, followed by a Liberal (and wishy washy - she was known as "Straddlin\' Madeline") spendthrift, followed by a "Jeezum Crow, I gotta clean up the f*cking mess *again*?" return, followed by a moderate Democrat who acted like a conservative Republican and fought tooth and nail with the Progressive wing of his own party.  Dean called them "kooks" and "nutcases" and "idiots" - and that was in public.  Do you see strong ideologies at play here?  Me neither.\n  \n -  The takeaway here is that Vermont politics is not so much ideology based as personality based.  People like Bernie and trust him, but outside of the enclaves of the Progressive Party, notably Greater Burlington and a few other cities, the PP doesn\'t have a lot of traction.\n\n- On Shumlin\'s failures as Governor (labeled betrayal).  Shumlin did come in promising single payer health care in Vermont.  It was to be the centerpiece of his administration.  Very unfortunately, the launch of the Vermont health care portal - a custom programming job for goodness sake, so that it could be unique to Vermont - was a much bigger disaster than the Federal portal.  It still doesn\'t work, and the Governor has said if it\'s not fixed by the end of May, it\'s going to be scrapped and Vermont will just use the Federal software. (Or maybe not.  There\'s been some hemming and hawing about this.  Heads have rolled, but not Shumlin\'s.)\n\n  -   We spent millions and millions on the custom site.  That\'s enough to piss everybody off, just to start with, and is one big reason that Shumlin came very very close to losing his seat in the last election.\n\n -    Shumlin had already annoyed the Legislature by refusing to discuss how the single payer plan was to be financed.  Various Democrats (and the exceptionally weak for now) Republicans kept asking, before the election, "Ummm.  Pete?  How we gonna pay for this?  What will it cost?  We\'d kinda like to know, if you don\'t mind."  After the election, the Administration came out and said, "Oops.  Sorry.  Too expensive."  The blithe statement that the cost could be covered by "taxing the rich" is just too disingenuous for words.  Remember there are only 600,000 people in the whole state, and the wealthiest tend to be retirees.  They can (and do) establish winter residencies in income tax free Florida but spend summers here.  There aren\'t enough 1%\'ers here to finance single payer.  It would take a broad based payroll tax, and few people were really eager for that.\n\n- Bernie as mayor of Burlington.  Yes, his supporters were called Sanderistas.  He did spend a lot of time and effort talking about Central America.  A famous quote from a disgruntled member of the city council was, "El Salvador!  El Salvador!  What about El Burlington?".  *However* - and it isn\'t something you read a lot about in the hagiography of Sanders - he was very practical and actually listened to the Old Guard that had run Burlington for decades.  He didn\'t always agree, of course, but when he wanted to accomplish something practical for the city, he brought them in and they helped.  He did a lot of good for Burlington and is one of the reasons that it still has a thriving downtown despite the Big Box stores on the perimeter.  And if housing is expensive, there is still some working class housing available.  (Although many people complain it\'s filled with UVM students pushing out the Burlingtonians.  The city keeps hammering on the University to build more on campus housing - it\'s an annual fight.)  Bernie talked a lot about Central America but he still got things done for Burlington.\n\n- Sanders has "uncritically supported the Democrats in Vermont".  Um, yes, but no.  Bernie is not playing on the Vermont stage, he\'s playing on the DC stage.  It\'s often a bad idea for DC politicians to interfere in State level politics, particularly outside of the electoral cycle.  A campaign appearance or two, maybe a pancake breakfast fund raiser here or there, sure.  But Bernie directly attacking Shumlin\'s policies in Vermont would be kind of offensive, even to us Sanders admirers.  "Mind your own business, Bernie" would be the tart reply.\n\n- The Great F-35 fight.  This is a local hot potato.  On the one hand, you have a long standing Air National Guard base in Burlington, Vermont (sent to patrol NYC on 911, no less), which provides a lot of good jobs, and gives tiny little Burlington airport really state of the art avionics, runway clearing (helicopters blow light fluffy snow off sometimes - it\'s fun to watch), and generally make it possible to fly in and out in frequent bad weather.  The F-35s had to be located somewhere, and a mix of upper middle class professions in South Burlington (where the airport is) went all NIMBY on it, aided by the old Left who just generally hate anything military.  After much turmoil, South Burlington voters went with the pro F-35 crowd, as did the entire Vermont Congressional delegation.  The city of Burlington bought out a strip of houses next to the airport just in case the F-35 turns out to be as loud as some shrilly say it is.  I don\'t know and arguments are ongoing.\n\nWell, that turned into a wall of text, even if I tried to restrict myself to the Vermont comments.\n\nTL; DR: The author of this piece misunderstands and misrepresents Vermont politics, and especially as it pertains to Bernie Sanders.'

What I have to ask though is who is willing to vote for Clinton that won't vote for Sanders? Because I've never met anyone who fits that qualification. \n\nI've met plenty that won't vote for either, because they're staunchly team Red. And everyone I've met who will vote for Clinton will vote for Sanders. But I also know quite a few people who won't vote for Clinton that will vote for Sanders. Now, I suppose that could change if the Republicans somehow manage to nominate someone that appeals to moderates (these mythical moderates I've never met, but I'm told must exist) and really cast Sanders as a fringe candidate... but I'm not sure the party is capable of that anymore."

Presidents can make more of an impact if they actually tried, and were not afraid of not being relected, or pissing off their uber donors. \n\n\nHe can't just write bills, but he can push the discussion in anyway he wants, get as much press as he wants. If Bernie is elected it is because of a massive grass roots effort, which would translate to more liberal seats this election, but potentially many more in the mid terms, if President Sanders is not letting the discussion drop, anything can be accomplished on that grass roots fire.

aS'If he wins the Democratic nomination, you can bet we will have a Republican President. They will treat him the same as they treated Ron Paul. It will probably be Hillary vs. Rand Paul, and of course they will cheat Rand Paul out of it and we will end up with Hillary who has the same policies as George Bush (for the most part). The King is dead, god save the King. Nothing changes. We will have a "George Bush" for the next 50 years. Democrat, Republican, Socialist, whatever "LABEL" you want to put on them, they will all just be  "George Bush". Sanders is great, but those in power will never allow him to win. He\'s just a spoiler for Hillary. 73 years old too. Remember how they treated Ron Paul at that age when he ran?? Even though the man will probably live to be 100 and he challenged all the Republican primary candidates to a 25 mile bike ride in the heat of a Houston summer, and all of them turned him down? Even Mitt Romney turned him down saying, "He would probably win." Yet, they painted him as an old kook who would die in office. I bet Ron Paul out-lives Romney and Santorum and all of those other knuckle-heads. They will paint Sanders as too "european" in his thinking, not "American" enough. They will paint him as a "kook". The same way they did to Ron Paul. So yeah, Sanders is great but he doesn\'t have a chance in this political environment. -- For posterity, this is Dr. Ron Paul challenging his opponents to a bike ride. This is a great little bit of political history for those interested, and a testament to how strong a candidate Paul really was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jus6l9l9zQo'

aS"I completely agree. Sanders rejecting big money is just hurting himself by giving himself a handicap. However, you can still play the game to the fulist, including taking money because that's required to get ahead. But Hillary hasn't even hinted at that she takes this issue seriously. She just says it as a quicky to get attention, but has no intention to do much about it. Sort of like when Obama would win people over by mentioning weed, then once he got in, he forgot all about it."

To be frank he's the only recent candidate that has had my interest because he doesn't mince words. \n\nThe only criticisms I've really heard are from democrats who say he will never best Hillary (we'll see) and from Republicans who say he's a socialist/communist radical (he's closer to JFKs politics than any socialist - only in America would he be considered radical.)\n\nCheck him out you might find he's someone you'd vote for.

Just because you fundamentally disagree with them doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t acknowledge that there are reasonably different views for a lot of important issues.

I think our current trade policy is largely, though not solely, responsible for undermining the American middle class.  I think the NSA's mass domestic spying is a gross violation of the 4th amendment and not actually effective at stoping terrorism to boot.  Finally, I'm sick of Middle East wars and Clinton is definitely more hawkish than Obama who narrowly avoided getting us mixed up in Syria as it is.  Or rather, more mixed up in Syria than we already are.  Clinton is pro TPP, TTIP, and TISA.  Clinton is pro NSA.  And I simply do not trust Clinton not to waste our country's blood and treasure on another avoidable war.  Meanwhile, Sanders is anti-free trade, anti-NSA and significantly less of a hawk than Obama while not being an out and out pacifist.  \n\nThe GOP may be even worse than Clinton but Sanders is much better than either."

aS'Sanders is not really a true "socialist" as most people understand the word, as he doesn\'t push a completely socialist government and/or economic system.  Rather, he sees the different economic tools to get jobs done, and applies them where practical: some things, like Social Security, shouldn\'t be privatized.  Small towns will have a volunteer fire department, which is communism.  Some things run best on a socialist structure.  Other things, capitalism works best.  He simply accepts that SOME things work best with socialism or some other economic system other than capitalism.  That\'s not radical; that\'s a recognition of reality.  The truly odd thing should be to be a capitalist and demand that all socialism cease.\n\nAnd on the issue of income inequality: it\'s a threat to democracy and national security, causes unnecessary suffering and squanders human resources.  There\'s nothing radical about protecting our country and people, right?'
p903
aS"Well, no. It's just that Sanders has no chance at winning the presidency. The Democratic nomination is the goal here."
p904
aS"He is the first candidate in our lifetime NOT bought by banks and oil.

This is why Bernie Sanders is capitalizing (socializing?) right now. "
p905
aS"It honestly scares me how many people on this sub want Presidents to hold the same power as tyrannical dictators.\n\nEdit: So, I feel like I should address what I meant considering the large number of replies implying I don't understand how the executive branch works. Trust me, I do know how it works. My initial response was a remark at how nearly every post on /r/politics about the presidential elections or just presidents in general for quite some time have had comments get upvoted clamoring for the use of more and more executive orders. It was meant to address the attitude people have that what we need is immediate, swift, and conclusive action by a single person to fix everything that has ever been wrong in our country. That attitude is dangerous.\n\nOn the note of the purpose of executive orders, they are merely a means of issuing how all offices under the executive branch should carry out a law enacted by congress. It's disheartening to me to see a large number of people wanting the executive order to turn into something akin to Palpatine's authority. \n\nPeople replying to me also seem to believe for some reason that I'm trying to protect the big bad banks from the glorious good of the government. I'm not. In fact, above all else I support wholeheartedly what Sanders is doing. It should be the legislative branch that issues any law to break up the banks. In addition, we should stop viewing our Presidents as these all powerful beings who should wave their dicks/vaginas around exercising power they shouldn't have. If you honestly believe the executive branch hasn't been accumulating power over the last thirty years or more you're blind.\n\nTL;DR: You're replies are figuratively killing me. Also, maybe you should stop reading TL;DRs and read the main body of text.\n\n\n"
p906
aS'I guarantee this is all part of the script. They will let Sanders gain traction, then sabotage him. Just like Howard Dean, Ron Paul, and every other party politician that actually stands a chance at getting elected by actual people, not money. They need him to energize the base, then convince everyone to fear the opposition and settle on Clinton. '
p907
aS"Part of the problem is that when you're beholden to money and special interests you can't exercise your full presidential powers. Sanders has none of those issues, he'll be able to follow his platform because if he wins then there will most likely be a populist surge and some dems will be able to take the 50/50 spots. When the public is voting out people who aren't getting in Line and your base is dying off reps are going to struggle. "

aS"Ugh. I'm so ready for this circle jerk to end. \n\nNo, socialism is not as American as apple pie. America largely rejects the European socialism that Sanders believes in.\n\nSure, some of my generation thinks socialism is nifty because they read about Marx in their poli-sci and sociology classes. But fortunately, my generation doesn't represent the majority of Americans. \n\nFortunately, Bernie Sanders is not going to win. "

aS'Yes.  So we need to get the message out to Democrats to under no circumstances vote for Hillary. \n\nBack Sanders as far as he can go. Once they hand the nomination to Hillary, make sure she loses by getting people to back third parties.\n\nI guess it\'s also possible Sanders is running only to run interference *for* Hillary, to head off the possible emergence of an anti-war/anti-imperialism candidate that could out flank Hillary to the left on economic issues. Sanders\' platform says nothing on foreign policy. That defaults to a policy of imperialism,  continuing "War on Terror," continuing insanity in Ukraine and Middle East,  new Cold War vs China. Which is basically a Bushian foreign policy. \n\nEither way, challenging Hillary from the left during the Dem primaries can\'t be wrong. His foreign policy sucks, but there\'s nobody better. And at least he isn\'t making it worse. And in the general, decline to help Hillary win by backing an anti-imperialist. \n\n'

If the country is going to be saved from this corruption then he is one of the rare chances to fight it. Unfortunately, I still am pretty doubtful that he's going to win and will become more so as the sheeples just watch more and more attack ads towards him and vote for Hilary instead because Bernie Sanders is such a stand up guy that he refuses to make attack ads of his own even when they're sent his way. Incredible. Can't wait to hopefully see him in the debates."

aS'It would be interesting to hear more specifically what he meant by expanding it. Is he talking about expanding veteran benefits? Because expanding Social Security for everyone who applies for it would nurture a culture of lazy people who will never work for the rest of their lives. Maybe he meant expanding it so that people who already receive benefits and are qualified will receive more money? This will obviously make their lives better but that money has to come from somewhere.\n\nThe really interesting proposal he is making is about creating jobs by updating and maintaining our infrastructure. This will allow people with a lower education to get a job so long as they are physically fit and have a clean record. It will also alleviate some of the burden on social security. This kind of reminds me of "America Works" :D\n\nTLDR; A vote for Bernie Sanders is a vote for American Infrastructure works'

Many hate him because he stands opposed to their ideology, some respect his conviction but simply disagree with him, and quite a few think he's 'kooky.' Not many would vote for him, but some would in the way some Democrats would vote for Ron Paul.\n\nBut the big difference between Sanders and Paul in the political context is that the Democrat base doesn't hate Sanders. Most of the Republican base hated Paul... just less than they hated Democrats. "

p923
aS"It's *how* cruz spits nonsense to the people, not necessarily *what* he says. Cruz is crazy or a liar, and he blasts this nonsense because he understands mob mentality and knows it is how he will achieve power.  Sanders wants to fix the unfairness of the system.  He is considered so far right because he's the only one playing the political game by the rules that most people deserve instead of the ones set out by people already in power.\n\nIt's quite refreshing actually...\n"
p924
aS"Obama campaigned with no voting history and allowed people to project their own desires onto his campaign. His populist rhetoric was empty, so it's hardly surprising that he didn't actually go through with half of it.\n\nSanders has been in Congress for nearly three decades with a remarkably consistent voting record, and he got there with crowdfunding and union support. He's given no indication that he's actually insincere in his convictions. When he says he's promising to do something, you can actually trust that promise.\n\nWhether it's *possible* for him to do it is another matter entirely, but since Constitutional amendments can be brought forth by the populace with a Congressional Convention, he doesn't actually need Congress to support the amendment. All he needs to do is gain access to the bully pulpit and rally the electorate around him so that we have a unified plan of attack to call for a CC and implement the amendment ourselves. It's really quite plausible, assuming he's able to defeat the Clinton machine to get the DP nomination (and win against the Republican nominee, but that shouldn't be too hard in comparison)."
p925
aS"The US postal service is on it's way out. And yes, exactly like GM. Banks are easier to go after because they don't affect the working class as directly. I'd argue thst Sanders is not the leader here playing pied piper to the populous (read: people)  rather that he is the follower after what the people want. American politics inexplicably demands and pushes leaders, when it is the people that should be leading politics. I think Sanders is doing just that. "

aS"It would be incredible if (the theoretical) President Sanders pushed for the constitutional amendment to overturn Citizen's United. If Congress doesn't do it (and who am I kidding, why would they?) I can actually see Bernie drumming up support for a constitutional convention to bypass Congress. Those at the state level are much less beholden to the big donors, and therefore could, in theory, get it done."
p929
aS"No measure that Senator Sanders has put forth has been passed. Therefore, his legislation is not productive. He does not put forth legislation that will even get voted on, let alone pass.\n\nPolitics aside, he does not reach across the aisle to try to write legislation that has any chance of passing. He writes all or nothing bills that can't get out of committee."
p930
aS"Unfortunately Sanders misses the problem here. First, the U.S. [has a relatively low concentration compared to other countries](http://are.berkeley.edu/~sberto/Banks07.pdf) (warning pdf)\n\nSecond, the banks failed due to inefficient regulations. No regulator knew who was to regulate what or even what some of the products were. This lead to gross misconduct, but nothing to do with size of the banks. \n\nI can only hope people can see that breaking up the banks wouldn't much but make some things less efficient while not adding much safety at all. "
p931
aS"Sanders is one of those guys who would try and find a way to muck that up right quick even if he had to use his own two feet and do it himself.\n\nHe would totally be the kind of President that would use every rule available to him to pressure the kind of change everyone wished Obama would do.\n\nHis opposition would be equally relentless so I think even if he somehow won this is one President that would require a massive amount of support from the population to constantly intervene with mass protests.... I just don't know if people are willing to do that.  It doesn't seem like it.  I don't think anyone will until they go back to the 1800s style shithole life that existed before the labour movement."

aS'Actually I agree with everything you said. I think there may have been some misunderstanding, I\'m not for an absolute leader, but I responded to the "until the next guy" person because the whole post stemmed from someone saying an executive order is overreaching. My main purpose of my posts was to explain that Bernie Sanders using executive orders for things like reversing Citizen\'s United, and actions towards his agenda are not overreaching as there are checks in balances in place. Basically I felt that the "until the next guy" person was trying to downplay Bernie\'s agenda by stipulating that it would be tyrannical.'

He has done nothing besides talk about how liberal he is.\n\nTo be fair, I'm a socialist, and if sanders does live up to his promise I'll be happy. I'm just extremely doubtful. "
p938
aS"Dude. You're living in a bubble.\n\nThe rest of the world is very, very different from the comments section of r/politics. Sanders is polling maybe 5-6% just in the dem primary right now. At best he might double that or even (absolute best case scenario) jump up to 20%. But that's it.\n\nI know it's kind of a crazy thing to accept, but mainstream folks really aren't foaming at the mouth with support for him and are perfectly content with a Hillary.\n"

aS'&gt; obviously you can\'t just ignore the game of foreign relations and not play it.\n\nMany other countries in the world do pretty well while not ignoring the game of foreign relations. They just don\'t bomb the shit out of everybody else. \n\nIt is possible to be involved in world affairs it cannot be avoided in this day and age and not receive the enmity of entire ethnic groups. I think that\'s the kind of "isolationism" Sanders is a proponent of (if he even is a proponent of isolationism?). I\'d be shocked if he was actually for what you are describing.\n\nIn fact, I can\'t really find any indication that he is even in favor of any kind of so-called "isolationism." If you have a source, I\'d love to see it. \n\nI don\'t think he ever suggests not being involved in foreign relations. That\'s absurd. And impossible. I think he\'s just more cautious when it comes to meddling in other nation\'s affairs. Just like most other places in the world.'

Consider Ben Rosenthal who sponsored [377 bills over the course of 11 years](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=409406) only to have three enacted--the same as Bernie. \n\nLet's pick names we know, though. [Obama sponsored 124 bills over 13 years and only 2 were enacted.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=400629) Over 8 years, Hillary Clinton sponsored 417 bills, and only 2 were enacted. [John Kerry sponsored 802 bills over 27 years](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=300060) and an astonishing 17 of them passed. John McCain is a bit distinctive. [Over 33 years he sponsored 806 bills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=300071) and 34 have them have been enacted. That's just over 1 per year! I'm not trying to shit on the topic, but most of those had to do with providing services to local Native Americans because Arizona has more reservation land than any other state in the country.\n\nThe point is that Sanders' sponsor to pass rate for bills isn't anything odd. He's an idealist, I guess, but *posturing*? Based on the pass rate of the bills he sponsors? Every person in congress sponsors bills knowing that it's got almost no chance to be enacted.

Sanders\' calm reasonability is no match for the right-wing propaganda machine when it comes to convincing the average voter, who is not much smarter than most of the fish in my aquarium. I will proudly vote for him in the primary as a show of support for his ideas, but I know he won\'t be nominated unless something crazy happens to Clinton. \n\nI\'m sure Sanders knows he won\'t win, and he\'s just running to boost support for his ideas.

aS'I can try to explain the bill, but it is pretty heavy oil and gas tax law, so if you have no accounting or finance background then it may be difficult for me to adequately explain it. I\'m going to use tax jargon so I can keep my explanation as brief as possible. \n\nHere is the bill: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s1041/text\n\nFirst note that I cannot give an informed opinion on the entirety of the bill. My knowledge is limited to tax law, which isn\'t discussed until Section 15 of the bill. All prior sections amend law that is not part of the tax code. I\'m also going to skip provisions to code sections I am unfamiliar with and are not easy to grasp with a single read.\n\nThings I personally agree with or don\'t care either way:\n*Removing IRC Sec. 43. This credit only applies when oil is below $34 per barrel, which it hasn\'t been in quite some time.\n\n*Removing IRC Sec. 45I. This credit only applies when oil is below $18 per barrel, see above.\n\n*Removing IRC Sec. 45K. This credit only applies when oil is below $29.50 per barrel,\n^Those provisions essentially clean up the tax code, with no real economic impact. \n\n*Removing IRC Sec. 263(c). This one is going to be a bit trickier to explain. This section allows an oil and gas company to deduct "Intangible Drilling and Development Costs" (IDCs) immediately, as opposed to capitalizing these costs into the basis of the lease and depleting them over the life of the well. This does not change the dollar amount of deduction an oil and gas company can take, just the timing. It is probably the most lucrative section in the tax code for growing oil companies. Currently, large integrated oil companies (there are currently five, think Exxon sized) are already limited to taking 70% deduction on IDCs and amortize the remaining amount of 60 months. This provision was enacted in the 1954 Code to ease the pain of risk, since oil and gas exploration is still one of the riskiest businesses out there with a very small success rate for wells even after collecting seismic data. This would hurt oil and gas companies, but at the same time bring them in line with the capitalization rules that all other businesses have to adhere to.\n\n*Amending IRC Sec. 167(h) to change the amortization period of Geological and Geophysical (G&amp;G) expenditures from 24 months to 7 years. If you look at early case law, G&amp;G was deemed a capital expenditure, so it would be depleted over the life of the lease. The production of wells is usually around 10-20 years, so even at 7 years (current time period of large integrated companies) it could be slightly advantageous over pure capitalization.\n\nThat ends the amendments I could see as fair alterations to bring oil and gas taxation in line with the rest of the business community.\n\nHere\'s where he loses me.\n\n*Removing IRC Sec. 613A. This is another area that is difficult to explain. As a precursor, I would like to say that when Senator Sanders introduced this bill, he stated he wanted to end subsidies to large oil companies. Large oil companies cannot utilize this provision. \nOne big issue with oil and gas extraction, is that landowners most often also own the mineral rights beneath the land. When they purchased the land, they do not allocate a basis to the minerals in place, so there is no depletable asset. This code section allows a deduction based on gross revenue received, so that people are compensated for having their resources removed from the ground. There is an exhaustive list of minerals that are eligible for percentage depletion, I think its well over 100. This provision is limited to an average production of 1,000 barrels per day, so relatively large (nonintegrated) oil companies like Anadarko with 42,000 barrels per day can only percentage deplete 2.5% of their production. This provision aids small oil companies and mineral owner and greatly helped the West Texas economy in the most recent oil boom. So in short, this screws smaller produces, does not effect the largest, and has a small effect on the relatively large.\n\n*Removing IRC Sec. 193. This would disallow deductions for utilizing tertiary injection. If you want to outlaw tertiary injection in the US that is one thing, but this would disallow deducting it for projects abroad as well, leaving US companies at a significant disadvantage. Not a well thought out policy.\n\n*Removing IRC Sec. 199(d)(9). This is under the Domestic Production and Activities Deduction. This is a general manufacturing provision that allows companies to deduct an additional 9% off of taxable income if they utilize enough american labor within US borders. Currently oil and gas is restricted to 6%, but this would eliminate it entirely for oil and gas. This would cause US oil to become more expensive while singling out oil and gas as one of the very few industries that is not available to utilize this code section. Also, screws the little guy, does lesser damage to larger.\n\nThat is all of the in-depth analysis I have energy for tonight. I also don\'t like the modification of foreign tax treatment, completely disallowing expensing clean up efforts, and the additional 13% proposed tax on oil extracted from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nI\'m happy to try to explain certain terminology tomorrow if you have questions. Sorry for any typos or wonky sentences, didn\'t feel like proof reading.'

Who in here wants us to raise taxes on your parents to pay for this?\n\n&gt; Not many, based on the show of hands.\n\n&gt; O.K., so much for financial aid, Sanders said, shrugging.'

aS"That's because the higher education *system* is junk.

What's crazy is a system that racks up more debt than credit cards. A system that subsidizes wealthy students at elite universities more than students public universities. Robert Reich, the guy who Sanders said he would make his Treasury Secretary, wrote [a great article](http://billmoyers.com/2014/10/17/government-spends-per-pupil-elite-private-universities-public-universities/) on this very issue."

He may not be getting as much news coverage right now, it's still very early in election season anyway, but he will be present in the debates and what he has to say could change the minds and views of many people willing to listen. That's a pretty big deal."

aS'Of course I am.  I\'m not an idiot.\n\nI also align, very strongly with Bernie\'s views and *greatly* admire his consistency.  Especially in today\'s political landscape.\n\nA lot of people are "one issue" voters.  Right now I am too, but my "one issue" isn\'t even Veterans.  It is getting the money out of our election process.\n\nHillary *says* she wants the money out of politics.  A decent number of politicians *say* they want money out of politics.  Their actions don\'t match their rhetoric.\n\nTHAT is why Bernie has my vote.  He isn\'t forming a superPAC.  He isn\'t taking corporate donations.  He has raised over 2 million dollars with an average donation of around forty dollars.  Donations from normal people who *also* want the money out of politics.\n\nConveniently, I agree with a lot of what Sanders has to say.  Conveniently, he supports Veterans and has sponsored a lot of legislation I am interested in that was voted down by people who claim to support Veterans but who\'s voting record doesn\'t agree.  Conveniently, Sanders is a consistent candidate that I think the American people can rely on.'

aS"I'm Vermonter and a veteran as well. Bernie Sanders spoke in a flight facility when my unit returned home, at the end of 2010, just a few days after his marathon filibuster. It was the first time I really took notice of any politician because it felt like he genuinely just cared about me as a person. \nHe was against the wars but he is the one who is fighting the hardest to make sure the people who had to  go are getting the care they need.

His platform is one of the only in recent memory that stands for the middle class and poor americans rather than the rich and big business. 11 of his 12 platform points revolve around strengthening our middle class and poor. The 12th is about addressing climate change.\n\nIMO, the US gives more than enough to big businesses and the rich. Their income and wealth has been rising for the past 30 years. Middle class and poor wages have been stagnant. The 30 years before that they were rising together. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate interested in reversing that trend.'

Affairs, Homeland Security.\n\n2. He is in charge of the party, so if you want the whole democratic party to follow the beliefs of Mr. Sanders that is quite powerful.\n\n3. The President has limitless access to the media. If he wants the whole country / world to listen to him he has that power.\n\n4. The President appoints those in charge of the 435 administrative agencies and can direct them to impose rules and regulations that have far reaching effects.\n\n5. The President can influence the way laws are implemented through signing statements and veto anything as long as 2/3rds of the Congress doesn't oppose him/her.\n\n6. The President has the power of executive order, which has the force of law, which he/she can be used to institute policies that are difficult to get through congress"
p1035
aS"He is an Independent, as it says in the second sentence on his wikipedia page.

The solution always seem to be more government/regulation.\n\nB) I actually believed that their policies would only tax/affect the rich. Obama promised for years that if we like our plan we can keep it, and that no taxes would be levied against the middle class for obamacare. Both were obvious lies. I realize he's not a progressive in the sense that Sanders is, but he's still a liberal.\n\nI will add, I do think Sanders is dead on with a lot of issues. He didn't support the bail outs or the Iraq war, he was one of the first people in congress for gay marriage, he understands problems with our criminal justice system, he knows the fed is enabling the banking cartel. \n\nHim and liz warren seem to think the Fed can be fixed but I disagree.

The Fed was established by bankers for bankers, that will never change as long as it exists.\n\n"

aS'I can objectively answer that for you! [Here\'s the post I made on the subject (so you can read the replies if you so care)](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqvvpsg). I\'ve re-posted its content below (slightly edited):\n\n----------------------------------\n\nUsing the Obama primary campaign as a comparison, what is the likelihood of Sanders\' campaign against Clinton succeeding? [Here\'s the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.\n\nThe following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:\n\n* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, \n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%\n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%\n\nNow, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):\n\n* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% \n\n* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   \n\n* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, \n\n* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%\n\nSo, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It\'s hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it\'s an insanely large difference.\n\nSecondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus "not-Hillary" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary\'s level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains "flat" she\'ll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). \n\nAdditionally, the "not Hillary / Bernie" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she\'s included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She\'s [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). \n\nIf I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the \'08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially "Warren Lite". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.\n\nSo where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)\n\n-----------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama "only" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she\'s doing a better job positioning herself as the "populist" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn\'t chip away at her initial polling numbers.\n\n[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]\n\n-------------\n\na shorter tl;dr: he\'s not in good shape right now...'

aS"So, I'm referring to Bernie Sanders deciding against talking about Clinton and instead talking about the issues."
p1053
aS"Some people do and still don't want socialism. Simple. Socialism isn't just the public policies, it is also the socialization of business and some people don't want that. Bernie Sanders isn't that type of socialist but media tries to act like he is."
p1054
aS"Sanders is a ratings bomb. He's not controversial, he doesn't have a sketchy record to report on, he isn't involved in scandals- he's the quintessential public servant that people always say they want in a leader. But this is America- if it doesn't sell headlines, the press won't promote it. Clinton is a ratings gold mine. She's everything the press LOVES reporting on and she's possibly the first female president. They can't pass up that kind of hype, regardless of how unfair their reporting is or the long term repercussions it will have on our country.\n\nI hope Bernie calls everyone of those assholes out on manipulating the election, including the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz, who's already grandstanding for Clinton. Fuck the Democrats- I can see why Sanders runs as an independent."
p1055
aS'The Clintons have always had a lot of support among the African American community, but I doubt many of them are aware that Bernie Sanders marched with Dr. King in the 1963 March on Washington and was a member of SNCC. More people just need to talk about him.'
p1056
aS"&gt;So in order for Sanders to win, he'll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway).\n\nEven then, about 29% of the Democratic delegate count is made up of party establishment leaders. Obviously, If Sanders were to be a clear favorite in the primaries they would move their support to him. However, in a close race, they would probably still back Clinton giving her the win. Sanders needs more than just a minor margin plurality to get the nomination, he'll need a relatively solid majority."
p1057
aS'By "the American leftist movement," I didn\'t mean progressive liberals. I meant socialists, communists, anarchists, and every other radical leftist tendency that has graced the United States.\n\nBernie Sanders is not a radical leftist and the fact that the United States\' collective mind is being blown at the presidential campaign of a social democrat just shows how pathetic the level of class consciousness has been these past few decades.'

aS'Bernie Sanders has my vote! :D'
p1059
aS"The comparison between Roosevelt and Sanders has at least one issue, even though the outcome in policy might be rather similar:\n\nRoosevelt was not a socialist himself. He was a convinced capitalist. The reason why he still enacted some of the furthest left legislation of modern US history is that he was faced with a situation in which he had to made compromises with the pressure from the left, or else the integrity of capitalism itself would be threatened from popular pressure. Roosevelt saved capitalism. \n\nBut since the 1970s the fears of the socialists from Roosevelt's times were proven right. When the principle of private property itself remains unbroken, the pendulum will swing back. Since then we went back to a political configuration were we are an effective oligarchy, [entered the first era in US history in which wages no longer grow with rising productivity](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg), inequality soars, and we have a complete disconnect between popular opinion and policy."

aS"Fringe national candidates hold public office in small states all the time. Sanders garned 207,848 votes in 2012. This is only about 80% of the votes the *loser* in the New York *City* mayoral election got in 2013. It doesn't take a lot to hold a Vermont senate seat.\n\nHe's fringe because [he's polling behind Elizabeth Warren](http://www.wmur.com/politics/wmur-granite-state-poll-clinton-leads-but-some-democrats-looking-for-alternative/32823502) in New Hampshire, someone who has repeatedly said she's not running for president. This is to say nothing of how he'll play in bigger states.\n\nHis actual political views having relatively little to do with why he's fringe. I think he's probably my favorite announced candidate with respect to his substantive positions (though I'm not a Sanders fan either). He's fringe because he has relatively little support, and even less chance of winning.\n\nWhat got us Bush was people backing another fringe candidate in Nader in 2000. "
p1062
aS'For some reason people think the office of the president has far less power than it does.\n\nThe idea is, those that turn out to vote for him will also vote for a Congress that will support him and help him apply pressure to them after he is elected to get things passed.\n\nSanders has also made it no secret that he thinks the bully pulpit should be utilized far more than Obama has. This is something FDR made use of and Sanders would follow. Not to mention the veto.\n\nWith the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890), Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), Robinson-Patman Act (1936), and the Hart-Scoss-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act (1976)  he can break up the banks and too big to fail businesses. \n\nHe has proven time and again that he is willing to fight for issues that do not seem to have a chance of passing. See the bills he has cosponsored, [here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357).\n\nThe presidency also has a lot of power over things such as NSA spying, trade policy, and constant invasions of foreign countries which are some of his major issues.\n\nOn top of these, there are the numerous potential supreme court slots opening up which would affect U.S. policy for decades.\n\nHim becoming president over any one else would mean a huge difference no matter how much the media and others try to downplay him or marginalize his potential in the office.'

She is in a tough place now because she can not support the bill and that will become ammo to use against her later on or she supports the bill to prove she's not for big banks and she loses a shit ton of her financial backing. \n\nHillary can't win this election unless she manages to best Bernie and he decides to not run as an independent. I'm not saying Bernie is going to win but if he runs as an independent we'll run into a Gore situation where he effectively cyphined votes that would have more than likely gone to the democrats which lead to Bush's election. \n\n2016 is going to be a really interesting year. Republicans are in control and just as Insane as ever and Democrats have two powerful candidates that can effectively ruin each other. If Hillary is willing to drop wall street she could pull ahead or at least give Bernie a huge push for office. \n\nLet the game of lies begin!"

aS'Your previous post shows that you went from being naive about how the political process works to a realist. No one gets 100% of what they want, this is why Sanders is loved here as he tosses out great black or white soundbites, yet they have no chance in reality, just like his chances of getting elected.\n\nYou should still vote but realize the US system is set up this way to prevent any one person from drastically altering the country. Thus change is slow and takes time. Obama has gotten a lot of good accomplished during his time in office so far, just not the naive sweeping change you think is actually possible by one administration in a small amount of time.'

aS"&gt; Sanders is never going to be president. Most voters are not ready to approve his full program. Still, he will have done this country a great service if, through his blunt talk and grandfatherly presence, he gets more citizens to stop being distracted by scare stories and political labels and to start considering ideas on their merits. A 40-hour work week, a minimum wage and restrictions on child labor were once thought of as subversive, socialist doctrines, but they have turned out to be pretty good ideas for Americans  except maybe for the billionaires.\n\nExcept for the last sentence. Good thing it's just an opinion column."

We also need more people, especially those who have more influence and ability to spread the message, to do so. We need famous people, forward thing companies who want to see our country not become a shithole, etc., they need to announce support.\n\nBut super duper mega extra importantly.. every one of you fuckers reading this, ALL you younger folks going "CAN THIS HAPPEN" need to fucking _REGISTER RIGHT THE FUCK NOW_ so you can vote in the primaries. If you fuckers don\'t vote and help make it happen then no, it won\'t. You must vote. WE must vote. We have to actually show the fuck up for this one.\n\ntl;dr - if you want this to happen then REGISTER and fucking VOTE in the primaries! Few younger folks I know bother to vote, much less vote in the primaries. We have to push if this is going to have a chance, and we have to start pushing now. Look up your voter reg, get registered, check your affiliation.. tell your friends to do the same! Talk about Sanders, challenge people when they brush him off as unelectable, question them when they just call him a \'socialist\', invoke Roosevelt, we have to push this message back in another direction if there\'s a chance of it happening.\n\nI\'ve seen it just about every day on reddit..

Kshama Sawant got elected as a City Council member for Seattle, and she was hailed as a success for the socialist movement and she made headlines. That's where the left wing is at right now. Small in number, disorganized, and fractured. There's hundreds of little groups, usually based around pro-labor stances.

Sanders is as far left as the party gets and that is a huge turnoff to a lot of people who might otherwise vote Democrat. I like Sanders quite a bit, but his role in the process is to pull Clinton slightly away from the center, not win the nomination. Shifting national political attitudes is a game of inches, not one of miles."

aS'Since Sanders declared himself independent, his open socialism need not rub off on the official Democrat party. So to the OP: no, people will not agree.\n\nHowever, there is an awful lot of enthusiasm for Sanders and Warren in the Dem grassroots, and both candidates are unabashed in their belief that a much larger welfare state built upon more steeply progressive tax code is required for social justice. \n\nA more accurate headline would be: "With Bernie Sanders running, can we all agree that the Democratic Party continues a 15+ year trend towards the left?"'
p1098

Sanders is little far to the left in some areas for my taste, but I will at least seriously consider voting for him if he winds up with the nomination.\n\nAll the Republican candidates?

aS"The thing about Hillary is that she's almost guaranteed to win if she gets through the primary. She may very well turn Texas blue with her support among women. I read a poll that said many Republican women would vote for her, upwards of like 30%, although I have no source at my finger tips at the moment. The flip side of this, which is very real, is that if someone like Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, he may very well lose the general election, leading to a republican president who will flip the supreme court from a 5/4 republican majority to a 7/2 republican majority, with life time appointments that will not only reaffirm Citizens United, but put American on a path that is so far off from what any voter who supported either Bernie or Hillary wanted. The scenario where Bernie Sanders wins the primary, only to lose the general election, paving the way for an extremist republican president, is not that far fetched. The echo chamber of Reddit wants to deny Hillary, and accept nothing less then their idea of perfection, but if that results in a Ted Cruz presidency then they, and the country, will certainly regret it for decades to come. I want a a wide field of candidates for democrats, but pretending that somehow our views are the majority does us a massive disservice. After all, in 2014 republicans destroyed democrats. "
p1111
aS"I think it is you that do not fully understand how vague the term socialism can be by itself. Going with the simple oxford definition. Socialism is when the means of production are owned by the community (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/socialism). The result of this in practice is state owned businesses (but it can in theory be on other forms as well, but this is the most common by far).  \n\nThis means that what socialism is can be rather vague at times, but this does include countries such as Cuba, North Korea, (the former) Soviet Union, and arguably Venezuela (all of these countries are mostly socialist). There are also many countries with socialist attributes such as France, but these countries still have a free market and there therefore by definition not socialist. \n\nAs I said in previous comments theory can be very different from reality and this is very true for socialism. In theory socialism can be a very moral kind of government that truly cares for its people. However as can be seen in history this does not always play out. \n\nThe problem with socialism in reality is abuse of power. All the countries I mentioned as socialist (even North Korea to some extent) started with good intentions for their people. However in socialism there is absolutely no way of regulating the political elite as they hold all the political and economic power. The result of this is that the political elite can do whatever they want which leads to abuse of power. Examples of this includes slave labor as can be seen in North Korea and an in the former Soviet Union.\n\nAnother problem I mentioned was little incentive to work. By this I meant that there was no reason for people to work hard in a socialist country because they all get paid pretty much the same anyways. This is not accounted for in socialist theory, but is the case in reality. One good example of this is how in Cuba you could a few years ago find doctors and engineers driving taxis because taxi drivers got paid more (because of tips by tourists). \n\nIt is also worth pointing out the 2 main forms of socialism. There is state socialism and libertarian socialism. What I have discussed above mostly falls under state socialism (except for the incentive argument). Libertarian socialism is probably what you mean when you say socialism as this is the kind that is viewed as the most moral. The problem however with libertarian socialism is that it does not work at all. I could go more in depth here, but to keep things shorter I will use an example. If I lived in a libertarian socialist country and I started a restaurant (where I had to grow all the vegetables and raise all the animals I was going to use) then the government would have to shut me down or force me to become government (if not then the restaurant would technically be a private business which socialism is opposed to). This does not sound very free nor moral as I am not allowed to enjoy the fruits of my labor. This goes on to the issue of dictatorship of the majority. In a socialist society it is the 51% that rules. While this might sound nice it leaves out 49% of the people. These 49% are not very free as they coerced to do whatever the 51% wanna do. They simply do not have a choice. The result of this is that freedom in any form of socialist society is rather reduced and that a free society can not be 100% socialist. A free society can have many socialist attributes, but will in the end not be fully socialist. The society Bernie Sanders wants is not a socialist society. It is a society with some socialist attributes. He does not wish to eliminate the free market, but instead wants to regulate it more than has previously been done.\n\nPlease before you reply understand that I'm arguing socialism in practice, not in theory. The theory sounds really nice, but is more or less useless since it is so different from real life socialism."
p1112
aS"&gt; After all, in 2014 republicans destroyed democrats. \n\nYou're overlooking the fact that there is generally at least a 20% difference in turnout during presidential election years than midterms. Statistically, democrats don't vote in midterm elections and that's nothing new. \n\n&gt;The flip side of this, which is very real, is that if someone like Bernie Sanders wins the nomination\n\nPlease show me where I once mentioned Sander's. Just because he and Hillary are the only people that actually get talked about doesn't really mean anything right now. A great deal can change alot in 17 months. Right now Hillary is leading based largely on two factors, *gender* and *name recognition*\n\n&gt;I read a poll that said many Republican women would vote for her, upwards of like 30%, although I have no source at my finger tips at the moment.\n\nI think that says a great deal about both Hillary's moderate-right views and dissatisfaction with the GOP among more moderate republicans.\n\nBottom line is that it's too early to declare a winner. Suggesting that she's guaranteed to win if nominated is misleading because that could be true of any moderate democratic candidate. The republicans are looking at Rubio(40%), Bush, or Huckabee(42%). Bush(53%) is a complicated choice because of the silent disdain among republicans for his brother. They've been pretending for the past 8 years that the G.W. presidency never happened and nominating John Ellis Bush would mean that they would have to face their past, something republicans really aren't good at. Rubio could garner support among minority groups, just as Obama did in 2008 and 2012, though in states with strict voter I.D. laws that may prove more difficult than before. Finally, I don't actually know enough about Huckabee to comment on his campaign but he's currently in the top 3. Following them, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are tied for 37% and Rick Perry sits at 36%. Cruz is too far right for democrats and a large number of independents. Rick Perry is an idiot(he was my state's governor for a decade unfortunately), and if Rand Paul can figure out what the hell he even stands for than he may have a shot.\n\nHowever, as I've said repeatedly alot can change in 17 months among both republicans and democrats. It's two early to declare a winner right now.   "

aS"Bernie Sanders hasn't got a hope in hell of winning this election because his policies are terrible.

I hope that Sanders is able to win over the Democrat party and then the presidency, we need an honest guy in office."
p1115
aS"Or it's because he, y'know, *doesn't stand a chance*. He's as old or older than McCain, whose age was a SERIOUS issue. And he's fringe-left. Even Republicans don't nominate fringe-right candidates. The only chance you have to win an election is to appeal to moderate independents like myself -- the ~10% of voters who don't blindly vote with one party or the other. A fringe left candidate is just as unappealing as a fringe right candidate to us.\n\nThere's no conspiracy, here. Sanders *doesn't* have a shot.

p1119
aS"Obvious op-ed piece, but the reasoning is sound.  I can't think of the last time we had someone who resonated as an authentic leader campaigning for the White House.  Bernie Sanders comes close, but he seems to be more of an ideologue than a leader of people.  I think both Sanders and Webb would act on principle, but I think Webb would be much, much harder to undermine or double cross without severe consequences.  I don't see Bernie Sanders as a credible threat to the GOP's stranglehold on the middle-right and right."

All that matters in a politician's life is their record. Sanders has a record of supporting gun legislation. Period."
p1122
aS"But he has no chance precisely because the media is pushing him out. If they do mention him, they treat he like is a clown. Sanders has more integrity than just about any politicians.

And as it stands today on [Realclearpolitics.com] (http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-3195.html), that brings it  Clinton 60.6 to Sanders 38.2--even without serious campaigning.

aS"&gt;wealth distrubution is a HUGE fucking issue... do you disagree?\n\nCan you explain to me why having unequal distribution is unfair? (I'm aware of the numbers but I'd like to understand your moral or economic argument.) I don't think its a good thing, but I think it's blown out of proportion. That said I do believe we can do more in terms of tax credits for the working class, and some tax increase on the wealthier classes to the end of balancing the budget.\n\n&gt;The banks are a big fucking problem and priority in addressing the issue.\n\nI'm not a fan of the banks having a stranglehold on things, but I don't think Sanders is proposing practical policy here with his bill.

I think a Bernie Sanders Presidency could bring real progressive change to this country even with a Republican controlled congress. There are powers that the executive branch has but haven't been used by establishment democrats like Obama and Hilary that are funded by Wall Street. \n\n1.) The president has the power to break up big banks with out having to go through congress. He will need to go through the Supreme Court, but it is worth noting that it is speculated that 3 justices will be nominated by the next president so I think he could have the support.\n\n2.) The president has power over trade deals. Currently Obama is working on a free trade deal within the Pacific rim called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). The scary this about this is that no one is allowed to know what policies the TPP contains until after congress approves it, they aren't even allowed to read it before voting. Sanders is the only announce presidential potential that is against it and as president he wouldn't need congress to act, and it is worth noting that [Sanders largest donations vs Hilary's](http://i.imgur.com/GCOVi0J.png) is really just Union and labor groups vs Wall Street.

aS'You\'re making a few fundamental errors.\n\nFirst, there is a difference between a socialist and a democratic socialist.  The former wants to replace the capitalist economic system with a socialist economic system.  A democratic socialist on the other hand wants to maintain the capitalist economic system for the majority of the economy but mitigate capitalism\'s negative attributes by socializing essential services and provide a social safety net.  It is the middle ground between pure lase-fare capitalism and total socialism.\n\nTo a fair extent the US is already a social democratic country.  Many essential services are socialized, pre-college education, police and fire services, most roads, some healthcare, ect.  And we have a social safety net if a weak one.  What Sanders wants to do is really just an evolutionary change rather than a revolutionary one by expanding what services are socialized and strengthening the social safety net.  Oh, and increasing labor rights, the other major piece of the social democratic system I left out.\n\nNow, as to the NSA, seem to be falling for the Republican dichotomy of big vs small government.  As should be clear from the strong GOP support for the NSA this simplistic view is false.  The real debate isn\'t about the size of government it is about the role of government.\n\nTake libertarians.  They are not for smaller government for the sake of smaller government.  Rather, they believe in reducing the role of government to just a few fundamental areas like protecting property rights and resolving disputes.  That results in a smaller government but that is a by product not the goal.\n\nDemocratic socialists believe that a fundamental role of government should be to ensure people\'s needs are met. The reason for this is that if a person is not having their basic needs met or in fear of losing the ability to meet those basic needs they are vulnerable to  coercion and so are not truly free.\n\nWhether mass surveillance is a good idea or not is really an unrelated issue.  People greatly value privacy.  It allows us to escape the pressure to conform to social expectations.  But some of these social expectations we can mostly agree are good, an extreme example being the social pressure for a pedophile to not molest children.  Or these expectations can be as harmless as holding an opinion that others in your social circle would disagree with.\n\nThe conflict is should people be able to escape social expectations or should they be under constant pressure to behave.  It isn\'t an issue that fits the standard one-dimensional left vs right spectrum because it really is an issue of authoritarianism vs anti-authoritarianism and there are both leftwing and rightwing authoritarians and anti-authoritarians.  It is a completely different political dimension.\n\nSocial Democrats like Sanders tend to be fairly anti-authoritarian.  It is the primary division between democratic socialism and communism which is extremely authoritarian.  And if you are wondering how a democratic socialist can be anti-authoritarian when they are for "big government" it is because of a difference in the perception of authority.  To the social democrat opposing the power of government is but one power to oppose.  The power of wealth and of institutional religion must not also be allowed to become controlling authorities either.  The fundamental goal of democratic socialism is to use democracy to direct the authority of government in opposition to the authority of wealth and religion and to achieve a balance.\n\ntl:dr Sanders is a moderately anti-authoritarian democratic socialist.'

aS'&gt; "If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist," Sanders said Tuesday. "No single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world economy into crisis."\n\nThis would be the end of international finance. Next time you travel abroad for vacation, forget about using your credit card. Hell, with the size of the US economy at roughly 25% of planetary GDP, I wouldn\'t be surprised if this ended up being the end of *national* finance. Fees using credit cards would go up because, of course, inter-bank fees apply when paying out of state.\n\n&gt; The firms on that list would also be banned from using customer money to make "risky or speculative activities on the financial market," Reuters reports.\n\nSo, no more lending mortgages, then?'

aS'The size of the bank is determined by the size of their portfolio. Now, the problem isn\'t that there is ONE huge bank cornering the market. That would be a problem, but it isn\'t the problem facing America. The real issue is that the world has 10 or 15 banks that are so huge that they dominate planetary finance. They are huge not because they have cornered the American market, but because, together, they have cornered planetary finance. Most of these banks are American, or have gigantic operations in the USA, but a smaller proportion of them are British, German, Swiss, French, or Japanese. (Note: I\'m including investment banks).\n\nThis is actually good for America because planetary profits for American banks are taxed by the US government, becoming a de facto taxation from the US on planetary trade. This is the system that enables the American Empire and American supremacy.\n\nIt does have its short comings, though. It makes those banks "too big to fail".\n\nIf you forced those banks to be broken in America, the reason why they\'re big (planetary finance) wouldn\'t go away, so they would most likely just relocate their headquarters from New York to London, or a similar finance-friendly city. They wouldn\'t stop being too big to fail the world economy. They would just stop operating as a unit in the US. They would be replaced by smaller banks without the scale to compete at a planetary level. So, it would be the end of US-dominated international finance. It may cause some strain on international finance while the banks re-adjust, particularly because the US represents a quarter of planetary GDP. But the banks will survive, just outside of America.\n\nAs for using your credit card, well, the banks that move outside of the US and continue to dominate the world\'s financial system, will have higher cost of servicing the smaller US banks. At the same time, they will have larger scale and power than the smaller US banks, so they will force fees upon them, which would be borne by the customer. Of course, you can either pay fortunes to use your credit card when abroad, assuming the smaller American banks can come to terms with their gigantic planetary competitors, or you could just not use it. I\'ve seen people from countries with small national banks (Argentina, Mexico, some African countries) struggling to use their nationally-issued credit card abroad and fail. The super rich in those countries have "internationally certified" credit cards that they can use abroad because they are paid abroad too, through affiliates. But for most people, that\'s uncommon. That is how the world looks like with small banks, and that\'s the world that Bernie Sanders wants: one where there is less economic activity because finance is hindered. Except he won\'t hinder international finance for ever. He would just shift it\'s power to outside the US.\n\nThis idea is very bad for America.'

The biggest one I recall from past elections was every time Ron Paul\'s name was mentioned they followed it up with something like "but he doesn\'t have a chance".

Even though it's Vermont, his history as a politician has been far from typical, perhaps he's got a better grasp of how politics works than anyone else.  \n\nI personally don't like the array of establishment candidates and something unique is very welcome in my opinion.

The libertarians brigaded up and provided the glue.\n\nRon Paul's Policy positions, proposals, and ideas are ANETHEMA to the vast majority of republicans and democrats and honestly only appeal to a fringe political ideology and low information voters of various types.\n\nBernie Sanders has policy positions and ideas that are popular with many Americans in many different areas.  he has some liberal positions that are maybe more deeply liberal than your standard democrat and he has a tendency to use rhetoric that is mostly avoided by democrats.  but the biggest problem that people see with bernie is that he is a self discribed socialist.  He hasnt been referring to himself or self identifying as socialist publicly and politically for a long time.  He doesnt even affiliate too directly with the Vermont Progressive party, which identifies as progressive, not socialist, and which grew up around Bernie in Vermont, and continues to be the largest third party operating in a state government(not doing too well lately, mostly because the Mayor of Burlington was a Progressive and he was incompetent).\n\nBernie is a pragmatic populist liberal who looks out for the people's interests.  He wants free community college, cheaper prescription medications, protect farmers and the diversity and security of our food supply, fight global warming and environmental collapse, fight for veterans issues, protect reasonable gun rights, and stuff like that\n\n[here is a good example of what I mean, his record on gun rights issue probably isnt perftect according to the NRA and a perspective that demands pure opposition restrictions.....but any reasonable person can see that he has stood up for and voted for reasonable protections of gun rights, including to protect gun manufacturers from liability and such, that rightwingers would have you believe no liberal democratic socialist progressive etc would ever support.](http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Bernie_Sanders_Gun_Control.htm)  For those of you who dont know, Vermont has extremely few restrictions on gun ownership and has extremely little agitation for gun control beyond the most modest reforms.  We are a gun owning rural sportsman's state even though we are the most liberal state in the country.\n\nbut he is not someone who wants to balloon the size of government nor someone who trusts government enough to do allow that.  But he is, as am I, even more concerned about the power of corporations, the super wealthy, and powerful special interests of every kind subverting the will of the people to the detriment of humanity.\n\nNot that I trust the NSA or the DEA of the CIA for a second, but I am at least as concerned with Wallstreet, Googlefacebookapple, etc and how closely they work with congress and all of the Letter organizations."

aS"What's the problem in trying? I am completely disillusioned with the American political system at this point and think it is fundamentally broken. Corruption is rampant in our government and the wealthy run this country. With that said though, Sanders is the first politician I have ever been excited about. He is the first candidate, at least in my lifetime, that has truly been for the people. So, for this election, I'm going to go all out and try to be the change I want to see in this country. I will not only be voting in the primaries, I will be volunteering for his campaign. Something I never ever thought I would do. I will go door to door, I will make phone calls, I will place signs. Whatever helps. I feel like if we want things to change we need to step up and try to be that change. Complacency is what has landed us where we are in the first place. \n\nI think bernie said it best himself. His presidential run is going to see, once and for all, whether or not a candidate who isn't funded by billionaires can even stand a chance in the modern day election. And while I think him getting the nomination is a huge longshot, it doesn't hurt to try. In a way, this will be a giant social experiment. If he fails, maybe it will just add to the frustration of every day Americans and spur some change in the future. And if he gets the nomination somehow, then I don't think him getting elected is too far fetched. \n\nMy main point is that there is no hurt in trying. If we all want to be apathetic and completely disillusioned with the system, maybe we should all try, just once, to help the only candidate that wants to make a difference. If he fails I will give up all hope for this countries political process for sure. But I figure I might as well try to be part of the change I want to see before completely giving up. \n\nApathy isn't going to change anything, people. "

You are absolutely right that most of the major banks, if not all, hold a variety of assets in a variety of industries and in a variety of geographies. My point was to ague against exactly what Bernie Sanders is proposing....that by breaking up the banks, some how you will end up with less risk. If anything, Canada's model of having a very small (in terms of number of players) banking industry comprised of large, diverse banks has proven to reduce systemic risk more so than the US model that consists of over six thousand FDIC insured banks. The simple reality is smaller banks have less scale and fewer abilities and thus are unable to diversify as well as larger banks. If you break them up, you will likely end up with a less healthy banking system, and will end up with a bunch of smaller banks that over time try to merge in order to achieve economies of scale, diversity geographically, and expand their service offerings. Ultimately you end up right back where we are today. So I don't support Sander's strategy here, but that is just my opinion.\n\nAnd I appreciate the kind words. Thus far everyone has been very civil, so I have enjoyed the discussion. I work at a bank, so I likely have a different perspective than most. "

We know from history how corrupt small government works, and it's atrocious. Perhaps small government could work better than big government if we had a functional system... but that's simply not the case right now.\n\nBernie Sanders is the only candidate proposing campaign finance reform to a level that would actually have an effect on our government actually following the role of a representative democracy. Right now, the voice of the people is statistically insignificant. Just look at this video--it explains the situation really well: http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/2015/05/corruption-is-legal-in-america-video/"

aS"In the Primaries for sure.  If AFTER the primaries, Sanders didn't win, then I will have to vote Clinton (which I believe is what you are alluding to).  People still have a hard time with this concept and refuse to vote for someone they feel doesn't truly represent them.  I agree it is most unfortunate that we have to play this game, but we do have to play it.  It will not change, at least not in any foreseeable future.  Voting for the lesser of two evils is a necessary evil, whether you like it or not.  \n\nEdit:  Thanks!"

aS"I wrote at length about this yesterday and I won't rehash it too much here but Bernie Sanders has a ceiling of support in the early primary states that have been polled to date and it's limited to about 25% of the Democratic electorate. And Hillary has a floor and it's about 50% of the same electorate. Reason being is that progressives are, to the tune of about 70-75%, satisfied with their choices in the primary and with Hillary Clinton as a candidate.\n\nIf Bernie was a viable alternative you'd want those numbers to, at a minimum, be in the sub-50's. And they're just not. Sanders supporters are passionate and vocal, to be sure. But there's just not a whole helluva lot of them. And while I'd like to say that there's some end roads for Bernie to make, the ones that are there just aren't very substantial. The only room for growth that Bernie can make that I see adds up to about 10% of the electorate and it's simply put male progressives. Strongly liberal males like Hillary the least and while they make up abut 20% of the Democratic electorate, they still support Hillary to the tune of about 49%. Even if Bernie can get, say, 75% of them on his side that's maybe another 5-10 points at best. So even on his best day Sanders is looking at about 20-25% of the electorate. A healthy percentage to be sure but nowhere near where he needs to be to make a dent in the Hillary machine."

aS'YouGov is actually a less-than-stellar pollster and this poll in particular is incredibly innaccurate and misleading.\n\nNow, why would I say that? First of all this is an internet poll, which by its very definition is highly specious. But as far as internet polls go YouGov is one of the better ones, so let\'s go ahead and look at it before we dismiss it completely.\n\nSo next up is the methodology: 1,000 Americans. Not registered voters, not likely voters, not Republicans, not Democrats, not Iowans or Ohioans or Michiganders: Just 1,000 Americans that took an internet survey. No limits on likelihood of actual political participation or geographic location or political affiliation. This kills the survey.\n\nBut let\'s go ahead and look at the headline: Bernie Sanders much more competitive than media is reporting\n\nWell, is he really? Considering that there\'s no willingness to separate Democrats from Republicans in the survey (or at least no indication they did so in the methodology) we can\'t be too sure, since if Republicans (who can\'t, generally speaking, vote in Democratic primaries) gave their opinion on the Democratic candidates, dislike Hillary Clinton to an extraordinary degree. (And indeed only 26% of survey participants self-described as "liberal" or "very liberal" whereas 36% of them self-described as "conservative" or "very conservative", so this poll already has a deep conservative slant.)\n\nBut I digress yet again. Is Bernie Sanders performing better than reported according this poll? The short answer is: **Nope**.\n\nBernie Sanders is polling at 15% in this YouGov poll. That is **exactly the same** as he polled in a poll from (a much more reliable and traditional pollster) Qunnipiac among almost 700 likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa that was also released today. It is also **5 points worse** than the UNH Granite state poll released Tuesday.\n\nThis poll is despite its many flaws _exactly_ representative of Sanders\'s draw in early primary states: 15-20% support  which is not onlt not enough to even begin to be competitive with Hillary Clinton; it\'s barely even enough to receive any delegates at the convention.\n'

aS"Yeah I'm not expecting you to clarify each time that you just mean the corrupt ones - that'd be unreasonable. I guess I'll just use Reddit to share the other side of the story.\n\nI started ~6 months ago age 22 as a graduate, so let's assume that's the earliest age to join the industry. So no banker under 29 was working during the crash, and no-one under at the very least 35 (but more realistically 40+) could've had any impact in the decision-making for it. Given the pyramid structures of these firms, that represents the vast majority of the employees in the industry.\n\nImagine you decided to push yourself at arguably the most competitive and meritocratic industry on earth - often working from 7.30am-1am. But everyone thinks it's okay to casually/dismissively badmouth you/your profession - in fact people are commended for it.\n\nI'm not going to say that it actually bothers me a great deal, but it creates a bit of an us-and-them thing.\n\nAnd that's without mentioning that it's already pretty much the most-regulated industry around, that the reason banks become too big to fail is because they provide so much benefit to everything around them that they become relied-upon, and that the sub-prime crash was caused not only by banks being willing to lend to homeowners and securitise mortgages, but also by the government promising better-than-expected housing for everyone (and altering regulation/monetary policy to encourage that) and homeowners for borrowing more than they could re-pay and in the process making poor choices for themselves. Everyone played their part and acted on their incentives, as you'd expect them to, and no-one saw it coming. And people say that banks weren't affected by it, which is just not true. Of the 11 bulge brackets, Lehman went under, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got acquired, and Nomura, Paribas &amp; UBS in particular have had tonnes of issues since (really bad issues). I'm from Britain and the banks here are equally fucked - RBS just lost 446m *in a quarter*, and 4 of the biggest 5 are currently being valued at under the value of their assets by the market (so there's actually a negative amount of value within the intangibles of the firms). Here the government bailed out Lloyds and RBS, but the shares are being trickled back out into the public, % by %, and the taxpayer is being repaid. It wasn't just a bunch of free money.\n\nNo-one on here would ever trust the opinion of an investment banker on these issues because we're biased, but we do know the most about this stuff. We understand that the reason these firms earn a lot of money is because they provide valuable services which add to the economy, not because they trick people and bet on a zero-sum gain. I can tell you from experience that the amount of regulatory hoops we already have to jump through is *insane*. We sell some retail products through independent financial advisers (not allowed to sell directly to the public) - and it's our responsibility to check that the IFAs are selling the products correctly, to the right profiles of clients and with the right explanations (we literally have to monitor the ages, wealths and investment experiences of all our retail clients and cut off business with IFAs if they're selling to too many of the wrong people. My desk alone has ~200,000 individual clients). It's not the investor's responsibility, it's not the IFA's, it's not the regulator's - it's ours. That actually takes a huge amount of work. Most firms make profit by being efficient and not spending employee time doing analysis that isn't completely necessary - stuff like this sticks out like a big red flag in relation to the firm's normal operations.\n\nA lot of the existing regulation is doing its job well. My feeling is that some of it will be pushed back - not expanded as Reddit seems to think - but that's neither here nor there. The point is that bills like the one Bernie Sanders is introducing come from people who have no understanding of what is a fairly complex system, and would destroy billions in GDP overnight.\n\nReddit seems to want lots of small institutions like credit unions to take retail deposits and invest them in risk-free assets. Has everyone forgotten that there was a huge crash when we tried that as well (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis)? The reason that financial systems keep fucking up is the same reason that people keep trying to innovate them and do new things with them - it's a huge gain to everyone when we get it right, so a lot of time/money is spent trying to perfect them. If you're unsure what I'm talking about - the primary function of investment banks is to facilitate capital markets, which, through debt and equity, allow firms to finance their activities. An efficient/competitive market (where investors are incentivised to pick the places where their money will get the best returns) encourages the money to be allocated to the companies that can use it to create the most GDP (and at the same time reward their investors). This means that the limited supply of money in the world is put to use in the companies who have compelling plans to use that money to grow and improve their business, which is a massive shot to the veins of the economy.\n\nIgnoring all of that, willfully misunderstanding the industry and demonising the people who work in it (who statistically probably had nothing to do with the crash and who work frankly ridiculous hours, creating GDP for the economy in doing so) is just not going to get anyone anywhere. Reddit should understand this.\n\n(sorry that was long I got carried away)"

Nobody's prediction is any better than anyone else's and there's no harm in exploring our options this far from the election.\n\nSanders so far has a better bipartisan (or rather non-partisan) appeal than Paul ever did.\n\nThe pattern I've seen up to this point has mostly been Sanders supporters talking about Sanders, and Hillary supporters talking about Sanders.  That's a win/win for him at this stage because what he needs more than anything now is sheer name recognition.\n\nSanders has zero war baggage and a lifetime of political experience.  That will become extremely important.\n\nThe same people who were new voters and Obama supporters in 2008, but became disenchanted in 2010 seem to be fairly common among Sanders supporters.  So he's already pulling in voters that became inaccessible to Obama and were always inaccessible to Hillary.  And that was a hell of a big group."

If that\'s the right term. I am in no way a pollster, sociologist or demographer. I\'m just another asshole trying to read the tealeaves.\n\nThis survey seems to break things down a bit more than what was on the wikipedia page, but take a look at item 3b. He polls well among self-described liberals (be they very or somewhat liberal). He drops to 16% at the self-described moderate/conservative Democrats. He has very little name recognition at this point and (as noted by someone elsewhere) unlike Obama hasn\'t been "groomed" for the job, so to speak. Much of the data was collected before he announced, but while speculation over his pending announcement was going on. He played coy for a long time.\n\nIn general, from what I see of the Quinnipiac poll, Hillary seems to be trending down a bit, and Sanders is on the rise with plenty of room to go. "Don\'t know enough about him to say" was something no one said about Hillary, but plenty of people said about Bernie. \n\nMuch as I hate to admit it, I am pretty sure that I misread the poll earlier, but I still think there\'s lots of hopeful data in it. I would like to see a Clinton/Sanders poll in about a month. I bet it would be intriguing. \n\n'

In the general election Sanders has no chance unless the Republicans choose one of their very longshot candidates and Sanders as a general candidate hands the Republicans the election."

aS"&gt;Exactly. Warmongering is standard practice, but when your campaign was based on the anti war vote, it's particularly hypocritical to EXPAND war efforts.\n\nIt won't be anymore if we can get Bernie Sanders elected. Here's his platform:\n\n&gt;**Income and wealth inequality:** In the United States today we have the most unequal wealth and income distribution of any major country on earth -- worse than at any time since the 1920s. This is an economy that must be changed in fundamental ways. \n&gt;\n&gt;**Jobs and income:** In my view, we need a massive federal jobs program which puts millions of our people back to work. We must end our disastrous trade policies. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And we have to fight for pay equity for women. \n&gt;\n&gt;**Campaign finance reform:** As a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, American democracy is being undermined by the ability of the Koch brothers and other billionaire families. These wealthy contributors can literally buy politicians and elections by spending hundreds of millions of dollars in support of the candidates of their choice. We need to overturn Citizens United and move toward public funding of elections so that all candidates can run for office without being beholden to the wealthy and powerful. \n&gt;\n&gt;**Climate change:** Climate change is real, caused by human activity and already devastating our nation and planet. The United States must lead the world in combating climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainability. \n&gt;\n&gt;**College affordability:** Every person in this country who has the desire and ability should be able to get all the education they need regardless of the income of their family. This is not a radical idea. In Germany, Scandinavia and many other countries, higher education is either free or very inexpensive. We must do the same. \n&gt;\n&gt;**Health care:** Shamefully, the United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. The United States must move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Health care is a right, not a privilege. \n&gt;\n&gt;**Poverty:** The United States has more people living in poverty than at almost any time in the modern history of our country. I believe that in a democratic, civilized society none of our people should be hungry or living in desperation. We need to expand Social Security, not cut it. We need to increase funding for nutrition programs, not cut them. \n&gt;\n&gt;**Tax reform:** We need real tax reform which makes the rich and profitable corporations begin to pay their fair share of taxes. We need a tax system which is fair and progressive. Children should not go hungry in this country while profitable corporations and the wealthy avoid their tax responsibilities by stashing their money in the Cayman Islands. \n&gt;\n&gt;And these are just some of the issues that we will be dealing with.\n\nBasically everything I care about. It's unbelievable (in a good way) that a Senator with these beliefs is running for POTUS."

aS"He appeals to a tiny sliver of people who are otherwise independent and he'll lose the centrist and right sections of the Democratic Party, who will stay home rather than vote for him; and Independents will stay home or worse, vote Republican.  \n\nWhat remains of left wing Republicans will probably stay home, but he will energize the right who will brand him a socialist and get everyone who is fiscally conservative, socially conservative, and/or hawkish out in high numbers to vote. Sanders being the Democratic nominee would probably set a record for the percentage of Republicans who go out and vote."
p1225
aS"And how exactly is Bernie Sanders going to accomplish this 'revolution'?\n\nIf he were elected President he would have almost no power to affect the electoral system, and unless he somehow motivates so many voters that they can clean house in the legislative branch over the next 4 years, literally none of his ideas will be implemented, because the GOP congress says no to anything even approaching change they don't think of.\n\n"

aS'People think the office of the president has far less power than it does.\n\nThe idea is, those that turn out to vote for him will also vote for a Congress that will support him and help him apply pressure to them after he is elected to get things passed.\n\nSanders has also made it no secret that he thinks the bully pulpit should be utilized far more than Obama has. This is something FDR made use of and Sanders would follow. Not to mention the veto.\n\nWith the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890), Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), Robinson-Patman Act (1936), and the Hart-Scoss-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act (1976)  he can break up the banks and too big to fail businesses. \n\nHe has proven time and again that he is willing to fight for issues that do not seem to have a chance of passing. See the bills he has cosponsored, [here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357).\n\nThe presidency also has a lot of power over things such as NSA spying, trade policy, and constant invasions of foreign countries which are some of his major issues.\n\nOn top of these, there are the numerous potential supreme court slots opening up which would affect U.S. policy for decades.\n\nHim becoming president over any one else would mean a huge difference no matter how much the media and others try to downplay him or marginalize his potential in the office.'
p1233
aS"That's some really pretty rhetoric.\n\nLet's boil some of that off and get to the core of the issue-\n\nYes. A democrat will likely add justices to the court that will, if prompted, possibly reverse Citizens United.\n\nBut, doing that judicially will take years, as first the balance of the court must change, and since that requires death or retirement that might take years in and of itself, and then it requires a party with standing to sue for redress, and that case must go through all levels of the judicial branch, again, incurring a long wait for any change to happen. \n\nThat is the most inefficient way to accomplish that goal I think you can manage. The quickest way is to pass a law that makes the ruling irrelevant. And that requires people to do more than vote for Bernie Sanders, or any Democrat, for President. \n\nElecting him doesn't fix that in any kind of timely fashion, and there are quite a few elections that money will rot before any kind of progress can happen through the SCOTUS. It's not practical to use that as a reason to make that choice. \n\n&gt;  Ultimately leading to unlimited campaign spending helping a Republican sweep of the rest of the states needed for a constitutional convention to rewrite the constitution in the grain of extreme right wing Republican corporatist oligarchic views. \n\nThat verges on conspiracy theory thinking. Not that the GOP isn't thinking of making lots of money and shaping American society so that they can keep doing that, but there's no reason for them to try to create a constitutional convention to achieve that. There are fringe elements who think that's a solution, but if you really look you'll mostly find they're railing on social issues like abortion or gay marriage, not ensconcing some oligarchic language into it. The system already gives them pretty much all the tools they need to accomplish their goals, so that hasn't been the issue for the last 30 years. The top 1% didn't get to have so much of the money because their strategies have been failing. \n\n&gt; Where as Bernie Sanders would not stop until Citizens United is overturned.\n\nStop doing what? Talking? As President he has no power to change it, except to wait for a retirement or death and hope the person he selects, *if* he can get them confirmed, *might* revisit the ruling, and only if there's a chance to do so.\n\nThe GOP congress will shrug off any calls to pass a law, simply because they can. The Democrats can hate the ruling all they like, but they don't hate the campaign money it allows them access to, so their resistance will be weak, at best. \n\nYou math doesn't figure. No amount of adding Bernie Sanders to the equation moves the needle when it comes to this issue. He's more effective, as a matter of fact, exactly where he is, if that's your intent.\n\n&gt; Bernie Sanders is the bully we have needed this whole time on the pulpit.\n\nBullies are only effective if anyone is afraid of him. He has no timely levers to pull to force anyone to do anything here. If you think otherwise, tell me what those might be. \n\n&gt; The only politician running who is willing to tell truth to power, consequences be damned.\n\nRight. So he's saying *unpopular* things? Because he sounds awful populist to me, sounds like he is feeding you big long menu of exactly what you want to hear, and hoping you will not realize that he cannot possibly put much of that on an actual plate.\n\nNo President you can elect can accomplish what you think is important in this particular case. You need to be worried about who your state elects next to the House and Senate, *those* people can get you where you want to go.\n\n&gt; He is doing that not for himself, but for America.\n\nRiiight. It's a selfless act, in no way based on his desire to hold one of the most powerful offices on the planet. Sure."

aS"&gt; With Bernie Sanders as President he would use the bully pulpit to levy pressure through media.\n\nWhy? What makes you sure that this is the case?

Oh, and wait until they start saying the 'S' word out loud. The GOP influenced portion of the universe lost it's mind when they *thought* the guy being elected *might* be a socialist.\n\nThis guy admits it, is proud of it and will repeat that he clearly, *is* a capital 'S' socialist. Now, once you hear the man's ideas you realize that they are not very related to the way the term was used during the cold war, but that doesn't matter. It's club to bat that man with that will never stop giving.\n\nIf you think the deep red constituency is ever going to get past that roadblock to even care what he's up to? You haven't read enough comments sections of You tube/Facebook/right wing blogs.\n\nIt's funny that a person with your username has such fanciful ideas of what Bernie Sanders can do, considering he's been in the Senate for 8 years with a pretty decent sized pulpit to bully from and hasn't really lit the world on fire, in Vermont or nationally. \n\nbut, we'll see. Maybe the guy has some heretofore unseen persuasive capabilities that turns 'socialism' from the equivalent of a political STD to some kind of wonder drug everyone wants to take. It'll be interesting to see if he can do that, actually, and if he does, I'll certainly hand the man my vote.\n\nUntil then? I'll certainly not buy what he's selling, because he can't do what he says he wants to do."
p1235
aS"Not at all. \n\nThe other option is to look at candidates with clear eyes, and separate out what they can actually do from what they *say* they can do.\n\nHey, if Bernie Sanders says he will do something that, as President, he can actually do, then you should vote for the man. But don't fall for the BS and elect the guy because you like his idea of some new progressive paradise, because when he gets into office? There's a whole lot of political reality that says that won't happen.\n\nI don't want to burst anyone's balloon, but I sure would like if it hovered at a sane altitude instead of flying way too high and then getting burst after the election. The last time we did this the entire youth vote drained away when Obama overpromised and underdelivered. They didn't show up and the Tea Party did, and it's been all dry with no lube since.\n\nAnd now Bernie Sanders is kicking off his campaign trying to pull the same trick, and I see people round here revving up to go along wit it. Great, might work for him, but we won't get a Democratic or even a progressive Congress for another decade if this happens again.\n\nThis is not a time for believing fairy tales. If the population of voters left of the conservatives screw this up, those conservatives will win the whole ballgame. \n\nDisbelieving totally? Same result. The GOP just wins because you don't show up *now*, instead of showing up now and then not showing later.\n\nBelieve what is likely to be truthful and discard that which is pandering. Support someone, anyone who has ideas that can pass through a GOP congress with a bit of compromise, not radical Earth-shaking ideas that won't make it out of any committee, anywhere. \n\nVote with your brain, for what we can actually accomplish, and not with your heart for what you wish would happen.\n\n"

aS'&gt;You got to be fucking kidding me, the top 12 richest people in America made 152 billion in the past 2 years and you think America cant afford "entitlement spending" to lift up the poorest among us... Come the fuck on.\n\n1) What the 12 richest people make is private income, entitlements have to do with government income. \n\n2) America already is running massive deficits to cover the expenses, but to be honest I don\'t know exactly which program is running a deficit, but e.g. the [social security trust funds](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/oact/progdata/fundFAQ.html#a0=7) will be depleted within the next 20 years in two out of three possible scenarios, in the third the trusts will remain solvent over the next 75 years. With not only healthcare costs rising, I doubt the likelihood of the last mentioned scenario. The current system is not sustainble, both in europe and America.\n\n3) 21-year-old virgin here, don\'t tell me about fucking ;D\n\n&gt;The rich must be reigned in and made to pay fair taxes. Corporations must be forced to stop offshoring money and jobs, and Citizens United must be overturned to take unlimited campaign spending out of elections and the media. \n\nAgree with that.\n\n&gt;This extra tax revenue in company with money saved from reducing military spending can more than pay for "entitlements" for the next 100 years. Healthcare, education, policing, firefighting, etc. are all things that must not be privatized or made for profit, because that profit comes at the cost of peoples lives, their chance to get a good education, or their right to have protection from crime/fire without a pay wall.\n\nYou might look into PPP, public-private partnerships.\n\n&gt;Im sorry, but as an Austrian you know fuck shit about American politics and would be better off if you left it to us... \n\nActually I know way more about American politics than Austrian politics, partially because I one day plan to emigrate to your country. And no, I will not shut up and just stand by, I\'ll voice my opinion just like everyone else. You disagree with me? Fine, I\'m always open for new points of view, always open for debates. But I won\'t shut up just because some guys behind a screen tells me to.\n\n&gt;We know Republicans are the problem, and Bernie Sanders along with a revolution to take money out of politics is the solution. The rest will follow once we can have debates without every politicians mouth filled with a corporate dick.\n\nWell, although I agree with you that the GOP has drifted away from its [traditional role](http://sun.iwu.edu/~iwucrs/oath.htm) almost too far, they\'re not responsible for every failure in the american political, economical and social system. But our view differ on that.\n\nAnd perhaps I got this wrong, but Sanders wants more taxes and more redistribution of wealth, so he\'s actually adding more money that circulates on the hill, or?'

He needs a machine. The RNC actually made a rule in 2012 allowing previous nominees to veto delegate slates at future conventions, in an attempt to further deter those outside the political process from getting involved. That's how successful Ron Paul was at showing his supporters how to put boots on the ground and infiltrate the political process so as to really when the grassroots battle. So successful that they made a rule against it.

In 1993, voted against the Brady Act, which mandated federal background checks for gun purchasers and restricted felons access to firearms.

That will be the first time most Republican voters get to hear anything other than "Bernie Sanders cant win".  They will slowly realize that because he is running a populist campaign he is espousing things they believe in, to some extent more fervently than the Republicans will offer.  They will notice he is just like them, old and white, and will be hearing him talk about the issues that directly effect them, like strong social security, medicare, medicade, etc.  This will be the bridge that Republicans need to abandon the crazy Republican establishment and elect a true Independent Bernie Sanders.'

Also, note also that Paddypower uses the bookie-odds, which aren't strict probabilities (as you can see from the fact that if you take all their probabilities together for the win on say the Republican nomination and add them up one doesn't get 1). Also, even given 16:1 and 33:1, Rand and Sanders may have a much higher chance of winning or much lower chance if the probabilities aren't independent. For example, if one expects that the scenario where either wins the nomination is where there's an overwhelming surge against establishment candidates, one would estimate odds at much better than 528:1, maybe something as high as 50:1. On the other hand, if one expects that many of the people who would vote for either Rand or Sanders are people who would be the same people and it matters whether they choose to vote in the Republican or Democratic primary, then it becomes almost impossible for both of them to win, and the odds should then be more something like 1000:1 or 2000:1.

That is a process that might need to take decades and can only happen after there is an alternate solution in place to ensure capital can still get where it needs to go. Sanders might have the right idea on a base level, but I don't see him proposing a solution to replace the banks once they're gone."

aS"The benefits of economies of scale a negligible when you have institutions with revenue that makes up close to a full percent of US GDP. Economies of scale works because you spread out overhead across units of production or across the amount of services provided. Yes breaking up banks does increase overhead but that only makes more jobs and competition there is no hurt to be had, really. And from a risk management point of view any institution can fail and not have a significant effect on the entire financial system. I doubt that Bernie Sanders knows most of this and he's probably only doing it to make it looks like he's breaking down Wall Street in front of his friends in big labor unions but I think that the benefits of this to the industry will be greater than Sanders realizes.  If anything he just asking the financial system as a whole to grow. "

aS"&gt; Nothing Bernie advocates really flies in the face of what an actual conservative would support.\n\nThe guy is a self proclaimed socialist. His views are literally the opposite of what an actual conservative would support. One of the chief tenets of American conservatism (and I don't just mean the current Republican Party) is free market capitalism, which Sanders is against.

p1342
aS'So, I\'d be way more concerned about the overly-broad derivatives provision than breaking banks up into smaller pieces.\n\n Lots of very different things are derivatives: futures are not much like swaps which aren\'t much like forwards and none of those are anything like options. Their only unifying characteristic is that a derivative is a contract for a (possibly contingent) claim on some asset of some kind. \n\nEven within those categories, different derivatives have wildly different risk-return characteristics -- and depending on which "side" of the trade the bank is on, many of them actually reduce the bank\'s overall risk of failure. Buying options: maybe costly, but risk-reducing. Selling options: probably lucrative, risk-increasing. Selling and buying "matched" options at a slightly different prices (selling to a counterparty that wants to get rid of risk, and buying from a counterparty that wants to take it on): slightly profitable, risk-neutral, and exactly an investment bank\'s job. This legislation does not differentiate at all among these scenarios, and that\'s a major problem. It gives the (accurate or not) impression that its author doesn\'t understand what derivatives are or how they work. \n\nEven sticking to the most traditional, vanilla, "boring" conception of what banks are supposed to do: they borrow short-term from depositors (and money market mutual funds, etc) to make longer term, risky loans like mortgages, car loans, commercial business loans, etc. When they do this, they\'re bearing two kinds of risk:\n\n1. Credit Risk: the risk that the person money is being loaned to will default on their loan.\n\n2. Interest Rate Risk: the risk that changes in credit-risk-free interest rates (primarily long-term rates going up unexpectedly) will make the payments from the loans they\'ve already made worth less in present value. \n\nCredit risk isn\'t much of a problem if defaults are independent across borrowers -- if each borrower\'s likelihood of defaulting is unrelated to whether any other borrower defaults, then as long as you have enough borrowers and charge them at least the Treasury rate for the same term plus their probability of default, you should be fine. \n\nIn real life, though, they\'re correlated: there are lots of conceivable things that can cause lots of people to default at once, and those tends to happen at the least convenient time possible. Because this kind of risk is difficult or impossible to "diversify away", whoever bears that risk earns a "risk premium" for bearing it. This is on the order of maybe 1-2% or so (above the raw probability plus treasury, or \'actuarially fair\' rate) under normal conditions. \n\nIf we really want banks to be less risky (and less profitable under normal conditions), then it would make sense to let them **buy** contracts from investors or reinsurers that would pay them if lots of borrowers default at once. That way, the bank\'s less likely to fail, and the people bearing the risk of losing money in events that would cause the bank to fail are earning enough for that risk (and have enough already) that it\'s hard to feel bad for them. That\'s efficient: the systemic default risk and the normal reward that goes  with bearing it go to whatever rich guy or mutual fund is willing to take it for the lowest return, and they\'re almost surely less systemically important to the rest of the economy than the bank is. **As long as everyone involved knows what they\'re getting** and giving away when they buy or sell it, everyone is better off. There\'s nothing wrong with investors bearing this risk (someone needs to do it if credit\'s going to be available to borrowers at all) and nothing wrong with the fact that bearing it is generally profitable.\n\nThat last "as long as" is actually really important. A particular subset of contracts like these (not all of them) contributed to the 2008 crisis because they were deliberately mislabeled to hide how risky they were, and in particular their systemic risk (the probability of lots of people not just defaulting but doing it all at once) was mismodeled (sometimes deliberately and fraudulently by people who knew what was going on, and sometimes mistakenly by people who didn\'t know better but probably should have). So it\'s not that reform and regulation isn\'t needed -- it\'s absolutely critical that contracts like this be constructed transparently enough that everyone in the transaction knows what they\'re getting and doesn\'t take on more of that systematic credit risk than they should realistically be able to bear. But if enacted, the bill Sanders filed would also ban banks from using much clearer derivatives to protect depositors\' money (er...to prevent the bank from failing so that the depositors have to go get their money back from the FDIC). It\'s a really blunt instrument that would completely disallow a broad set of tools, many of which have lots of perfectly legitimate uses. \n\nBanks also use different kinds of derivatives (e.g., futures on Treasury rates/bonds) to mitigate their interest rate risk in a similar way (they pay a risk premium to some investor who\'s willing to take it). Those present much less potential for systemic risk than credit-default-linked derivatives and have never been controversial until people started saying "ban ALL the derivatives!!1!" recently. \n\nRegarding size / breakups / too big to fail: \n\nI don\'t care about this as much. Big banks are almost certainly less risky than medium sized banks because they can be more diversified in terms of borrower mix. But it\'s not clear that HUGE banks are any better this way than merely big banks, and maybe some of them should be broken up. I do think breakup advocates vastly overstate the extent of "monopoly power" from the current huge banks, especially if we include large banks headquartered outside the US that do a lot of business here (I didn\'t see Deutchebank or HSBC on Sanders\'s list...). It\'s not like clients of investment banks don\'t have twenty to choose from. It also might make regulation and monitoring harder, rather than easier, to split the existing huge firms into twice as many merely big ones. On the other hand, it\'s possible breaking them up would mitigate systemic risk enough to be worth any extra oversight costs. **I don\'t know what the answer to this is, and it\'s an important question. But if Bernie Sanders can\'t tell an exchange-traded rate future from an OTC swap, then I definitely don\'t think he\'s the person to answer it.**\n\n**TL/DR:** It\'s things like this that make me dislike Sanders and Warren. When they talk about issues like this and call for regulations, they make it sound like they have little or no understanding of how even a healthy banking/financial system is supposed to work. It\'s not that I feel bad for the banks; they\'re doing fine and on balance we really should be harder on them. We certainly need more transparency and oversight. But the details are really, really important. Replacing "hail the banks!" with "f*ck the banks! And stop them from taking RISKS and using spooky derivatives!"  doesn\'t really help. More like a  clumsy step too far in the right direction.'

If Warren is seen as an "outsider" to America\'s dysfunctional politics.  If she gets lumped in with Hillary, she\'ll just be another Dem in progressive\'s eyes.  \n\nSanders is rising sharply in polls, and half of democratic voters don\'t even know about him yet.  You\'re underestimating his grassroots support, his record, and his leadership ability.  It\'s not just topics like Hillary being for the ACA, and Sanders for guaranteeing everyone healthcare.  Sander\'s grassroots campaign strategy, because it is being effective, is nothing like American politics has ever seen.  And it\'s going to be talked about, and how Hillary is very much not going that route.  There\'s an allure to Sander\'s campaign that gets progressives, the apathetic, etc. out.

They feel like they don't have a horse in the race, so they simply don't participate.

Thus a lot of power depending on the financial/political Ecosystem you're in (as in this is less of a problem in a heavily regulated ecosystem). \n\nHaving a shit ton of money is actually a problem in our current system of government. You can't have companies able to donate or buy politicians at such magnitude. With enough money you can buy both sides.  Bernie Sanders is running today specifically stating that this is one of the reasons. Citizens United is taking away democracy and giving us Oligarchy. Banks that are too big to fail are the top of this oligarchy and the fact that the laws work in their favor is direct evidence of this. The fact that a crash as bad as 2008 could happen and everyone at the top got away Scott free is evidence. The fact that they BENEFITTED from the crash is more evidence and means their power has grown even more. With everyday and with every bit of legislation they are getting to pass they are getting closer to full control. \n\nThis is why they are pushing so hard against net neutrality. Control communication and you control the masses. This almost sounds like a conspiracy theory but we are returning back to serfdom.

Compound that with Sander\'s volunteers, and that will be a variable that we don\'t know how it will play out in America, because it\'s never happened before.  \n\nPeople being talked to by volunteers who are part of this "major grassroots presidential candidate" they\'ve heard about, I think can affect people to vote who usually don\'t, and get people who poll for Hillary now to vote for Sanders.  There\'s alot of campaigning, both in the media and on the ground to go, and half of democratic voters don\'t even recognize Sander\'s name yet.  \n\n&gt; the value of pragmatism\n\nI\'d vote for Hillary in the general, if Sanders doesn\'t make it, for sure.'

aS"I've not been around as long as McGovern and Mondale but I have been around for more than a few primary fights. The key aspect that people for sanders seem to keep forgetting is that party leadership makes a huge difference. There seems to be a misconception about Obama's run in 2008, he basically had a perfect storm of good speaking, surprise challenging, debate skills, and most importantly endorsements and even with all of this it was an incredibly close race. Obama began effectively courting super delegates in 2004 when he gave the keynote at the convention, from there he used Dick Durbin to establish connections within the party. Super delegates matter. A lot. They count towards overall delegate count and their endorsements can make or break a candidate. They campaign for you and usually have a following that brings votes, Obama actually beat Clinton in super delegates and that was a Huge determine factor of him winning. Sanders doesn't have any of that built in, he's from a small state with little connections, and has been running as an independent his whole life, sometimes even against democratic candidates. A lot of party faithful will be wary of that. \n\nI use Obama as the example because really there's hardly anyone to compare Hillary to, she's been so well established its crazy and just added Secretary of State to her resume and I think she's learned from her failed run in 2008. Plus She has the power of using one of the most popular figures in the party, if not the most popular figure in the party with bill Clinton. It puts her in a unique position. She's extremely well established, currently well liked in the party with a variety of experience and a huge secret weapon campaigning. Obama negating bill a little by getting maybe the most well liked woman in America on Oprah to campaign for him in 2008 in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Bernie doesn't really have that help, even the biggest name that would most likely agree with him, Elizabeth Warren, seems to be tepidly supporting Clinton probably looking to run in 4-8 years herself. Now Maybe you could argue Robert Kennedy in 1968 challenging the sitting Vice President but he had the Kennedy name and even before the assassination he was trailing and likely to never catch him in delegates. \n\nOverall I think it's great a lot of people are excited about sanders but party politics is tough, and the general can be even harder. I don't see Obama's unlikely win in sanders. He has a lot of things working against him and a lot of problems in terms of electability to compound those problems. There have been similar candidates (kuchinic, I know people hate the comparison but Ron Paul for the republicans, etc) and they have faced the same hurdles in the past without much result, I'm not optimistic about his chances but everyone has the right to campaign and donate and speak in favor of a candidate I just hope people take a step back and be realistic about the situation. If they end up disengaged because Clinton wins or wins big I am afraid of the progressive base of the party not showing up to vote as is needed in the general. There seems to be a resentment about her, which granted I know for progressives she's hardly a perfect candidate but she's also a lot better than a republican. Having a republican president could be disastrous for the Supreme Court. There are currently about 4 justices at or approaching retirement age. Ginsberg, Kennedy, Breyer and Scalia. Two of those are liberals, one is a swing vote and one is a conservative. If any one of the first three leave with a republican president then the court shifts from a split court like we currently have to a solidly conservative court, and the other justices are young in comparison. It's really something that could affect the laws of this country for decades. It's what concerns me the most. "

aS"I think what you mean is that by decreasing NASA budget, the government effectively lowers the amount of money that it subsidizes to then private industries. \n\nMy point was, that while the private industries that do research for NASA recieve a fair portion of subsidization from the United States government, a decrease in this money might starve them for the time being, until they innovate and find alternative means to making money. \n\nThe oil industry began under private industry without any government intervention. It wasn't until the purpose of subsidizing these industries became vital to the continued existence of the governments that it began to see government intervention. My point is that decreasing the money spent on NASA is one thing, but one should focus on where the money is spent alternatively. Republicans want to stop funding NASA so it can be spent on defense, Sanders wants to decrease funding NASA and do what? It appears he is all for scientific research, which is a plus. Personally, I think we need to advance more in science before we can honestly tackle the space problem, and with a limited government budget, right now funding science in other areas might be reasonable. "
p1357
aS"It is a disingenuous title though isn't it?  It appears to be suggesting that Sanders is just like the conservatives who want to lower NASA's budget, which couldn't be further from the truth.

aS'&gt; Admitting that you could be the one incorrect in singe situation isn\'t giving the other party free reign to be treated as absolutely correct.\n\nThere\'s nothing in what he originally stated that corroborates this assertion.  He\'s since admitted that on issues he knows less about, Sanders is more than likely right.  There\'s absolutely no reason whatsoever to believe that to be true.  It could very well be that on issues you know very little about, any politician may have a position that is absolutely wrong-headed, and it would be naive to trust any politician on such an issue without knowing anything about it.\n\nJust to be clear, there\'s a gigantic difference in saying "I like this politician even when we disagree on certain issues", and saying "This politician is right on certain issues I know less about even when we disagree on them."'

What I think is that if you took a look at his Senate record, you knew he supported these things all along, and that he's not compromising. He's always been and has governed as a Third Way Clintonian.\n\nTo clear up the Gitmo misconception, Obama's plan was actually regressive. It stripped detainees of more rights, and the ACLU opposed it. Warren and Sanders actually both voted against it too.\n\nI personally think she'd be much better, even though I'm not sold to her 100%. There are still positions of hers I'd like to know. I'm by far convinced Sanders would be many times better than Obama.\n\n"

p1374
aS'However, the polling would suggest that Mr. Sanders is incorrect.\n\n-----------------\n\nI\'ve made the same post on the subject a [couple](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqvvpsg) of [times](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqvvpsg) and thought I\'d reiterate it here. \n\n\n----------------------------------\n\nUsing the Obama primary campaign as a comparison, what is the likelihood of Sanders\' campaign against Clinton succeeding? [Here\'s the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.\n\nThe following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:\n\n* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, \n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%\n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%\n\nNow, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):\n\n* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% \n\n* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   \n\n* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, \n\n* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%\n\nSo, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It\'s hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it\'s an insanely large difference.\n\nSecondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus "not-Hillary" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary\'s level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains "flat" she\'ll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). \n\nAdditionally, the "not Hillary / Bernie" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she\'s included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She\'s [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). \n\nIf I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the \'08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially "Warren Lite". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.\n\nSo where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)\n\n-----------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama "only" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she\'s doing a better job positioning herself as the "populist" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn\'t chip away at her initial polling numbers.\n\n[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]\n\n\n-------------------\n\nNow, as has [been correctly pointed out in each of the two times I\'ve posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqw26xs), Obama entered the primary in February, so by now he\'d already been campaigning for some time. However, when you go back to the February data, the picture just gets more damning. \n\nLets look at the data back in mid-Feb. There were two polls 2 days after Obama announced:\n\n** Poll 1**\n\n* Clinton 37% - Obama 17%, \n\n** Poll 2**\n\n* Clinton 28%, Obama 24%\n\nSo this actually paints an even bleaker picture for Sanders. Coming into the race, Obama and Clinton were polling neck and neck in one poll and were relatively close in the other. Sanders is down by like 50 points in all of the polls from early May when he announced.\n\n#In Conclusion:\n\nThe polling data would suggest that Sanders is going to have a much harder time (than Obama) dismantling the "presumptive nominee" Hillary Clinton.\n\n'

aS'Yet, NOWHERE CLOSE to being in the 1%, again!\n\nLook up 1% of NET WORTH.  $400K isn\'t even close.  \n\nBernie Sanders is not within a mile of being a 1%er.

p1377
aS'For those who do not know, the Citizens United vs FEC (corporations united) was a Supreme Court ruling that corporations can donate indirectly to politicians through political ads funded by corporations (direct donation is still illegal, which would be much worse than what we have now). However, this "donation" has become into "bribery" since the corporations obviously have more money to donate than an invididual, meaning that they get to control the politicans who make rulings that puts the money back into the pockets of the corporations, all at the expense of the middle and working class. Sanders wants to bring an end to this and corporate money in politics overall. This is why him becoming the president will possibly create a second Progressive Era, and even if he doesn\'t win the president position, his ideas will still be planted in the public and he will most likely be the Barry Goldwater of Liberalism (although Goldwater did not win any presidency, he did create the ideas that became new conservatism and were used by Ronald Reagan and Reaganomics.) '
p1378
aS"I'll believe Sanders is more than a stalking horse when he starts attacking the shady Clinton Foundation donations. \n\nThat's the sort of corruption he usually rails against. "
p1379
aS"This is both smart, and consistent with [Matt Yglesias's piece on why Sanders is so popular around Reddit.](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8560925/bernie-sanders-reddit) (tldr: He's not trying to win, so he doesn't need to worry about the fact that his positions don't have mainstream appeal)."
p1380
aS'Nobody who is running for president is going to say, "You know what, I don\'t really have a chance in hell of winning. I just have some issues that are very important to me and I want to get them in the spotlight before I fade away as a historical footnote." (Which is slightly better than the GOP\'s also rans which is, "I know I don\'t have a chance in hell of winning, I\'m just hoping to get a ton of free air time and ink to promote my book and hopefully line up a show on Fox Business Channel. Now go donate to my SuperPAC.")\n\nBernie does not have a chance of winning. Not in the general and certainly not against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Look at the polls: HRC has 60% support in New Hampshire and Iowa. Bernie has 15 on a good day. 75% of Democrats have Hillary as a first or second choice versus 20 for Bernie. And most importantly 70% of Democrats are satisfied with their complete lack of choices. Now I\'ll grant that eventually the laws of gravity will catch up with Hillary\'s numbers. Throw a couple more honest competitors at her and they might even drop to the mid 40\'s. But Bernie (and all other comers) are going to top out in the high teens, maybe _maybe_ the low 20\'s. I\'m glad you all are passionate about a political candidate. But 2015 is not 2007 and Bernie Sanders is not Barack Obama. And I know it because unlike 2007/8, Bernie\'s supporters aren\'t in it because they love the Democratic platform; they\'re just in it for Bernie and most (though not all) of them will evaporate as soon as Hillary gets the nomination.'
p1381
aS'True yet when does the mainstream start to vote against it?\nAre there any candidates that even talk about it?\nExactly why Bernie Sanders is so important.'
p1382
aS"Well, there are some other factors.  First, there is significantly more class division this time and Sanders has a lot more appeal to the much more numerous class.  Second, past elections were largely negative--people voted against other candidates instead of for their own.  Obama made strong gains by taking a more positive approach--the Hopey-Changey thing.  Sanders' campaigns have all been 100% positive.  Third, Dean's 50-state strategy had a powerful influence in 2008.  Dean seems to like Sanders' chances.  Fourth, the Iraq War vote is still a big deal to many of us.  Hillary has admitted that she considers it a mistake.  Sanders can run around and proudly say he was right and can foresee consequences she can't. \n\nSo I think it's much more complex than simply taking past polling patterns and mapping them to today's dates and numbers."
p1383
aS'Fun fact, Sanders has more money than Marco rubio'
p1384
aS"That's not entirely true. But if you want a different metric, look at endorsements: [as of mid-April](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/238912-2016-hillary-endorsement-list), Clinton had already secured endorsements from 104 Democrats in Congress, more than the 99 she got during her entire run in 2008. Sanders has zero."
p1385
aS"I thinking polling data is great at the right time. I don't think it is useful at this point in the primary process, especially on the Democratic side. Hillary is largely ahead due to name recognition and is generally well liked. Sanders is a relative unknown and even less known than Obama was when he was running for Senate. You have to remember that Senate candidate Obama likely had bigger name recognition than Sanders does today due to his very well receiver convention speech and bio. \n\nYes Sanders has an uphill battle to get the nomination but I don't think the polling numbers are a useful measure of that. "
p1386
aS'There are certainly differences between the two elections both in candidate substance (as you\'ve pointed out) and and procedure. I actually think the biggest difference is that there are only two candidates in the race this time, meaning Sanders\' platform will probably get a fair amount more attention that it would otherwise get in a crowded field of 4-5 candidates.\n\nThat said, the differences in the polling data between Obama and Sanders is so significant, so damning to Sanders that I think it\'s worth noting, if for no other reason than to prevent the echoing effect of /r/politics from giving people a false sense of reality re the primary situation.\n\nImportantly, the fact that Clinton is polling well over 50% puts us in a markedly different situation than in 2008 because it means that Sanders has to flip not only all the undecideds, but also a substantial number of Clinton supports. [And as was pointed out in an earlier reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3522ut/bernie_sanders_says_more_than_200000_people_have/cr0nl0z), in a "close race", the party establishment (aka the Superdelegates) - which controls nearly a third of the primary votes - will still probably back Clinton due to her (currently) more perceived ability to win the general election and close relationship that Clinton has with many of them.'
p1387
aS"People say Clinton faced similar kickbacks  as Obama faces. \n\nFact is, they'd do the  same for anyone: They're extremist-right-wing racists who serve their billionaire-donors only. \n\nSanders in the general election can cause a huge turnout, resultin in a Dem supermajority. Even without that, might as well have Sanders making executive orders among all the blockage. But what's *more*, Sanders is planning to keep his grassroots network alive after winning, something Obama didn't do. That will mean the national conversation will show the Republicans for what they are, and mid-term elections will have better turnouts for Dems. "
p1388
aS"You can't apply the same rules to this campaigns as last ones, b/c Sanders campaign (which is proving to be the successful strategy), is completely unlike anything before in American politics. \n\nOnly 13% of Hillary's supporters are sure they'll vote for her (of the 51% of dem primary voters). Sanders has 13% of the voters, who are 100% sure of him. 50% of dem voters don't know him yet. There's plenty of fertile ground for Sanders. \n\nedit: Sander's campaign is unique b/c it is completely grassroots, that is a very alluring variable, and is being brought up very often by the media, which both acts as a positive ad for Sanders, and a negative ad for Clinton.  "
p1389
aS"What we do know from this data, is that the 13% or so of Dems supporting Sanders are definitely voting for him. That's up from 6%. That's huge this early and in a week. \n\nOnly 15% of the 51% who poll supporting Hillary say they will definitely vote for her, and only 50% of Dem voters even know Sanders. \n\nThe election is up in the air. "
p1390
aS'Bernie Sanders is the candidate of choice for a new generation who has never heard of Eugene McCarthy.'
p1391
aS"Bernie Sanders is an experienced candidate who speaks the truth. He doesn't have to carefully parse his speech to avoid slipping up in a gaffe. He stays consistent; that way he doesn't have to worry about what he's saying to one group being surreptitiously recorded and used against him. Poor Mitt must have always been so scared to really speak his mind, and then when he did and it was recorded, it derailed his campaign."
p1392
aS'&gt; That said, the differences in the polling data between Obama and Sanders is so significant, so damning to Sanders that I think it\'s worth noting, if for no other reason than to prevent the echoing effect of /r/politics from giving people a false sense of reality re the primary situation.\n\nOk.  To what end?  What are you trying to convince us to do and why are you trying to convince us to do it?\n\n&gt;it means that Sanders has to flip not only all the undecideds, but also a substantial number of Clinton supports. \n\nYou\'re making an assumption that we can\'t know yet: that he cannot gain votes from the opposing team.  I certainly have no way to prove it will happen on a wide scale, but among the people I know, Sanders has a surprisingly high appeal among republicans.  Probably because their field is so laughably weak and the republican leadership has been an embarrassment to them.  Most voters still have the ability to sense honesty--they simply don\'t get a lot of opportunities to demonstrate it.\n\nSo I still think the poll numbers you keep going back to aren\'t able to give us a complete picture.\n\n&gt;And as was pointed out in an earlier reply, in a "close race", the party establishment (aka the Superdelegates) - which controls nearly a third of the primary votes - will still probably back Clinton due to her (currently) more perceived ability to win the general election and close relationship that Clinton has with many of them.\n\nI\'d be surprised if they did that.  The blowback from upsetting the younger voters who\'ve embraced Sanders this early would be extremely painful in the general.  We saw in 2010 how much damage disheartened voters can do.  In past elections with candidates who were more similar it wouldn\'t matter if super-delegates threw their weight around since it\'d be hard to even notice a change in the outcome, but there could hardly be more contrast between Clinton and Sanders.  \n\nIf they have any sense they\'ll tread very carefully.'
p1393
aS"Thing is, Sanders has never and will not run negative campaign ads. He will though bring up his issues that are also what's wrong with Hillary, and the media highlights those differences. "
p1394
aS"I guess I don't understand what the problem is.\n\nEdit: Sanders is running as a Democrat. If he loses the primary, he said he would endorse the Democrat who won and not create a Nader situation. He has stated this specifically. Where's the problem?"
p1395
aS"&gt; That's the sort of mindset that keeps us in a mess of career politicians as the American way.\n\nSanders has been in Congress for a quarter century and was a mayor for nearly a decade before that. He is literally a career politician."
p1396
aS'By all means, let\'s be realistic. \n\nAnyone who actually thinks Hillary Clinton has a snowball\'s chance in hell of winning a Presidential election is out of their damn minds. \n\nSo far, Sanders has a pretty strong populist approach and that\'s going to net him some growing appeal as the cycle moves forward. Hillary\'s already hamstrung by hate from her husband, the whole "Benghazi" affair (which, believe it or not hasn\'t been "settled" at all to the satisfaction of a large number of people) - and she\'d be perhaps one of the easiest candidates to target for devastating smear campaigns in the light of the Clinton foundations financial higglety-piggleties. \n\nI usually vote dem. And when I say that I mean I almost always vote dem. But there\'s simply no way in hell that I\'d consider flipping the switch for Hillary Clinton. The support for her just proves to me that the DNC is so whackamole out-of-touch with the populace that the entire party itself has lost its credibility. \n\nAs far as I\'ve been able to find, Sanders has consistently said what he means, hasn\'t prevaricated, isn\'t embroiled in the hint of a scandal, and has only the tag of "socialist" to overcome. \n\nAnd with the current state of domestic affairs being what they are...I don\'t think that\'s going to be as hard to do as some people would like to imagine.

aS"I disagree, I'll focus on this much more but Ron Paul has had a populist campaign strategy and it turned out very little results, Perot was probably the last somewhat successful populist candidate and he had to spend an insane amount to get the 18% he got running as a independent. Looking at it Obama was much better positioned than sanders so much so it's far off to even compare the paths they had/have, the only thing revolutionary with sanders its virally backed very early where Obama tapped into social media a little later but to a much bigger degree. Obama used a grassroots campaign but he compounded it with an effective strategy to win the primary with endorsements and big name support. Sanders has almost no super delegate support at the moment, Obama had been working on his essentially since 2004 when he did the keynote and connected with long time party insiders dick Durbin, deveal Patrick among others to essential wreck Clinton's party by overwhelmingly taking super delegates, most notably Ted Kennedy who might have been so important it won him the whole damn thing. On top of that Obama started with Oprah campaigning, which was huge and had an extensive network of community organizers and training in community organizing to win Iowa and gain momentum from there, then bill clinton's gaffe in South Carolina which helped turn out even more African American voters made him dominate South Carolina. \n\nObama started out stronger, caught Clinton by surprise and have a clear plan set in place to win the nomination with years of back work and it BARELY worked out for him. That's not to even mention he was a once in a political generation speaker and excellent debater with a clear concise message. Sanders has a nice message but isn't a great orator, doesn't have any democratic connections (he's not even been in the party, he's ran against democrats his support by the brass of the party is very small) and many other factors on top of how hard it was to beat Clinton the first time, most likely harder this time now she's taking the primary serious from the beginning and essentially paid her dues to the party elite means sanders has a very small chance of pulling anything off. He's improved but not polling as well as Obama when he started off and his fundraising numbers look nice now but over the scope of what the primary and general will cost isn't all that important yet, especially with the fundraising power that Clinton has. \n\nObama winning was a surprise but completely on plan and had a clear path. Sanders currently doesn't. Super delegates keep getting overlooked, as does how hard it was for Clinton to be beat in 2008 and how it was basically a perfect storm to lead to Obama's win. "

Then he will be seen as a real candidate, and that's when many Hillary supporters will swing to Sanders.  He has a top-notch marketing team, gives great speeches, has a large volunteer workforce and donation force, and a great record.  You know what matters greatly, and is unique in this election like no other presidential election?  When every time the media mentions Bernie Sanders (and they do it alot), they mention how he's running grassroots, and Hillary is not.  That works as a positive ad for Sanders, and a negative Ad for Hillary, and it's going to be branded into everyone's mind in the coming months.  \n\nI'm not surprised most people don't think he has a good chance.

aS'Given the current system I would advise against voting third party. Since there is no sense of representation by voting population (i.e if 46% vote democrat, 45% vote republican, 1% vote tea party, 2% vote green party, 3% vote party X and the last 3% vote party J then the representation is the same based on those percentages) but rather by majority, we have a big problem. The majority system kind of sucks and it works against a third party candidate. I know that voting for a lesser of two evils (not to imply Sanders is an evil, of course) is not a "good" thing to do, but it is probably preferable in this situation.\n\nHypothetical scenario: we have 3 candidates: Bob the democrat, John the republican, and Roy the independent. Roy\'s position on issues is significantly closer to Bob\'s than to John\'s (let\'s say they Bob and Roy agree on 80% of the issues; John and Roy agree on 20% of the issues). There is only one person who can be the representative and only one of those three can be the representative. The fact so few these days vote independent means that there is a very sad result: the independent hurts the candidate to whom he (or she) is closer on the issues. With Bob and John, the results may read as 52% Bob, 48% John. But with Roy in the picture, we may end up with 47% Bob, 48% John, 5% Roy. \n\nIf you identify as a third party then that is fine. However, I do think that voting that third party in the current system is not advisable. Sure, Sanders was elected as an independent. But there are so few of the such now that they are the exception.'
p1422
aS"No offense, but I think you are looking too far ahead.. The odds of Sanders winning the nomination are very slim.  The only way I could see it happening is if halfway through the primaries Hillary had some health emergency and was forced to drop out.  Even then, I wouldn't bet on it because the Democratic party establishment would enter panic mode and pull whatever shenanigans necessary to pick someone else as nominee.\n\nAs much as Reddit loves this guy, and don't get me wrong I like him too, he is not electable in our current political climate.  A not insignificant portion of the population honestly believes everything Obama does is some sort of secret communist plot to subvert the constitution and declare martial law. They believe this about Obama, whose actions as president could barely even be characterized as moderate.  How would they react to someone who openly declares himself a democratic socialist?  No amount of reasoning and explaining will convince them that he is not Lenin reborn.  \n\nWhat Sanders run can do though is provide a platform for expressing actual progressive ideas and actually fight for them rather than apologize for them.  This is a fight that needs to happen for there to be any chance of moving the political discourse back towards the realm of sanity where in the future a person like Sanders will have an actual chance.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure I would even want Sanders to win the nomination this year.  People are quick to forget history.  McGovern in 1972 comes to mind.  He was the Liberal wet dream.  He had helped reform the democratic nomination system so that the nominee was chosen by the primary voters instead of democratic party bosses.  Then he ran a powerful grass roots campaign to win the nomination in the face of huge establishment opposition within his own party.  After winning the nomination he received little support from much of that establishment and outright opposition from some of it.  He then went on to lose 49 of 50 states in the general election and lost the popular vote by 23 points making Richard Nixon president again.\n\nI'm not saying people shouldn't vote for Sanders.  I hope they will and in large numbers.  But if we want real change in the Democratic party and country as a whole I believe we would be better served by him coming in a strong second for the nomination than winning it.  Not because I like Hillary, I certainly do not.  Because Rome wasn't built in a day, and you can't move the overton window in one election cycle."

aS"Though I was excited about the enthusiasm of candidate Obama, I have been disappointed with president Obama...\n\nHe does not appeal to his base.\n\nHe seems obsessed with compromise, but every time he takes a step to the middle, he just gives his opponents a chance to step further to the right.\n\nI feel like we ended up with a center-right president.\n\nThe president doesn't make laws, but the world watches the president closely. The president has the opportunity to set and frame the national dialogue. He can also make very important appointments.\n\nTom wheeler and the net neutrality rules are an example of what a bold president can accomplish. I would hope to see similar things from a sanders presidency.\n\nBtw, one of the most impressive things to me about sanders is the way he brilliantly holds his own on fox TV news without ever backing down from his views or resorting to petty attacks.\n\nI think Sanders is the leader we need. Proactively searching for a compromise is a mistake.\n\nAnd I really doubt it is possible for him to be hated as much as Obama lol."

You literally cannot conceive that someone who is highly intelligent and totally aware of Sanders would be totally against what he stands for.\n\n&gt; the best ideas and policy positions\n\nI understand you think Sanders is that man, but that is not even remotely objectively factual. \n\nJust as one example, we had a big thread about his plan to break up the banks. Universally knowledgeable people who know about economics thought it was a dumb idea and that banking regulation was what was needed.\n\nAnd I personally believe Sanders absolutely knows it's a dumb idea. So why did he propose it? Because he knows it makes him look good, and more importantly, *he knows it has no chance of passing*. He knows it's terrible legislation, and if it did have a chance of passing, I think he wouldn't push it. But since Sanders is all about empty populism, he pushes the dumb idea."

Some European countries are even built on these political ideologies, most notably the Nordic nations. Countries like Norway are built so much on this ideology that they can be described as social democracies. \n\nWhat he is asking for is not crazy. It's not even new. He's not asking to go beyond Norway. He's not asking to even be Norway. He's quite modest in his goals if looked at through the prism of a social democrat. He just wants a considerably move in that direction, and America is so far away from such a point that it seems crazy to some people. \n\nI think it's important to emphasize this point, because what Ron Paul was asking has never been seen in the modern world before. Ron Paul really was advocating for something completely new. We know what Bernie Sanders is asking for. Much more extreme versions exist today than what he is asking for. \n\nNow of course I'm describing this somewhat objectively. I don't think such rationale will fly in American politics anytime soon. I do think it's important for people to understand the distinction though. Social democracies do exist today, and they do function with a good degree of success. "

Getting Bernie in is showing the politicians what the people want. They need to follow by Repainting both houses.\n\nOne of my greater concerns isn\'t that Bernie isn\'t a great candidate, it\'s that even if he does get elected, people will grow impatient with his inability to effect change as they continue to support sitting representatives and senators. If there\'s one thing I hope he does is to push for strong electoral changes including term limits in both houses.\n\nLast issue though is how he plans to deal with citizens united. I too feel it\'s wrong, but I also see how it\'s a very difficult issue. It\'s easy to say you want money in politics gone, but how do you do it? The opposite end of the spectrum is the japanese electoral process where everything is publicly financed and tightly controlled. The problem here is no-one knows what each politician stands for. They\'re each given a short timeslot on public tv to make their stance clear, and they\'re allotted space for posters. Canvassing is not allowed. They\'re not allowed to run print, tv or internet advertising and I believe they\'re even banned from appearing on tv for some time before  the elections.

And the really bad thing for Hillary with the sole competitor Sanders is, when she tacks further to the left to secure progressive votes, she is going to have more trouble *flip-flopping* to the centre and right if she secures the nomination.  With more competitors she can stay more vague with what she stands for, so she can stand for what ever sound bite will get her elected.\n\nWhat she wanted in the primaries was no competition, and now what she needs is lots of competition, otherwise the whole atmosphere could flip just like it did in 2008.\n '

aS'Populism is not on the political spectrum, it just depends on how and why you appeal to the electorate.\n\nGenerally, it means adopting policies not because they are good, but because they are popular, adopting policies that are seen as challenging elites or the establishment, relying on grassroots support, often populism embodies short term thinking at the expense of long term goals or big picture ideals.\n\nSometimes populism is very successful, other times it attracts only a vocal minority, and it can also fall flat on its face of the electorate is actually smarter or more pragmatic than the populist candidate counts on. For example, a candidate might run on the idea of a deep tax cut that everyone loves, but the electorate realizes that such a tax cut will lead to lower defence spending and severely weaken the country so they might think twice when they pull closed the curtain at the polling station.\n\nBoth Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders are populists, they just both come at it from opposite angles. Ron Paul\'s "end the fed" and Bernie Sanders\'s "too big to exist" are both populist policies. In the case of Ron Paul, he wants to shut down the federal reserve and completely privatize US monetary policy. In the case of Bernie Sanders, he wants to break up the "too big to fail" banks. Both appeal to a mass audience who either see the elites in government controlling monetary policy and messing up the country, or see the elites controlling the big banks and screwing up the economy.\n\nI can also see drawbacks in both policies that could contribute to a lot of people becoming wary of them, which would then lead to a voter backlash despite being popular policies that seem to have a lot of support.'

And Obama was charming and a good speaker, but he had little in the way of credentials, which the GOP certainly made sure we knew.  Sanders has decades of experience, as a Mayor, in the House, in the Senate.  Being outside of politics and outside of corporate america, being a "poor" senator, he has a lot to connect with the average man about.  It\'s not hard at all to make Hillary look disconnected, hell didn\'t she make some remark about her and Bill not making "much" even though they rake in hundreds of thousands for speeches or something?\n\nThe saying I\'ve heard many times has been that the US elects the President they\'d most enjoy drinking a beer with.

aS"&gt; This little known Senator named Obama came and stole the primary up from under Clinton.\n\nThat really paints a lower value for Obama's campaign organization and support at this stage of the 2008 primaries. He was already frequently [polling within 10 points of Clinton in early May 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates). In mid April he had a tied poll with her; in mid June he polled ahead of her for the first time. Clinton's poll numbers were frequently in the mid-to-high 30s; [today her poll numbers today are often in excess of 60 points -- and that's for polls that include Biden and Warren, who aren't running. Sanders is polling in the single digits](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html).\n\nIf you want to support Sanders, do so! But don't trick yourself into thinking that 2008 is a good campaign from which to base the hope for another insurgency; the situations, when looked at closely, aren't good comparisons. Sanders will need a different blueprint if he wants to win."

aS"You act like you're dealing with rational people.  You're not.  God himself could come down and lecture Congress on how they should pass a measure to help the poor; the Republicans would call him a socialist and keep whatever bill he wanted passed from seeing a floor vote.  \n\nSanders is a better choice than Clinton, but don't be fooled into thinking he can make Republicans see reason.  They're very well paid *not* to see reason and there's not a whole lot he can do about that.\n\nedit: a letter"

aS"That's just it, though.  Sanders can make speeches until he can't speak and he simply won't get through to the serious right-wing crowd to whom his words are meaningless simply because he's a socialist.  Drive every actual independent so far to the left that the Democrats get them all and the Republicans will still hold one house of Congress.  The same people who wouldn't vote for a black guy to be President aren't going to vote for a socialist or anyone who seems likely to help him achieve his goals no matter what Sanders says or does, no matter how much it would help them."
p1452
aS'Maybe. The question is, can he drum up enough support to get voters out and beat the upswell of voters coming out on the right to keep the "socialist" from being elected? \n\nIMO, the problem he\'s got is he\'s actually a left-leaning candidate. The centrists among the democrats are, comparably speaking, fairly right leaning as well. The theocratic nonsense coming from the far right pushes a lot of the independent voters left, but how many of them are willing to go that far left?\n\nSanders beating Clinton in the primary may very well give the white house to whoever ends up on the Republican ticket as long as they don\'t pull a move as stupid as picking someone like Palin as a running mate. '
p1453
aS'The difference between him and the other candidates is that most candidates support essentially keeping the status qou while Bernie Sanders supports what would be pretty big changes in the system.  It is natural that someone proposes a dramatic change that the follow up question is, "how do you plan on achieving that?"  If I say "I want most things to stay the same" people won\'t question how I plan to achieve that because it is obvious, but if I say "I want most things to change dramatically" people are going to naturally ask I will bring about these dramatic changes.'

p1455
aS'It would be extremely easy for them to focus on her and not attack each other, then as the primary reveals which one is more likely to win, either Sanders endorses Bernie, or Bernie endorses Sanders.\n\nHonestly, whatever we can do to feed the media its "horse race" narrative and get them to bite on the idea that the the democratic nominee *might just not be* Hillary Clinton, the better chance we have of making that happen.'

aS"You'll never have to worry about him having to be president. I like Sanders, but he would get stomped ridiculously hard by Jeb Bush.

p1457
aS'The only way Bernie can beat Hilary is if he starts to mobilize his supporters to be delegates for him at their local and state conventions.\n\nThe DNC will do everything it can to handpick the candidate of their choosing. They will use media blackouts, they will give Bernie less speaking time at debates, but most importantly they will pull out all stops to make sure Hilary delegates dominate all slates.\n\nIf you are a registered Democrat make sure you make it to each and every convention, and start NOW. You need to become a delegate, for Bernie Sanders, and Bernie Sanders needs to bring everybody together towards this singular purpose, taking over the conventions and winning delegate seats.\n\n[Here is Rachel Maddow explaining how Ron Paul utilized the delegate system to give Romney a run for his money during 2012 primaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBLhnCHR2aY)\n\nIts really hard to find good info online on how to work the conventions and the delegate process. It is however, the most essential part of an election, and the most power we have as people to influence the election. Keep your eyes and ears open for more resources and guidance as you go forward, for Bernie.'

p1459
aS'&gt; Probably his best one (and thus the one least likely to pass) is to remove the upper cap on contributions to FICA which pretty much instantly makes both medicare and social security solvent for the next 75 years\n\nAs long as you either don\'t pay (or don\'t account for paying) the higher monthly payments which come from higher contributions. He\'s taking projected costs under the current system and saying "see, we just need to raise the cap and we can cover those costs". And what\'s sad is that he knows that he\'s leaving information out (about either the costs or the massive shift from Social Security as a repayment to social security as welfare), but knows most people won\'t notice it.\n\nAnd none of that brings in enough revenue to make Medicare solvent without major changes to Medicare. \n\n&gt;His plan for "college more affordable" is probably tied to his "Free community college for all" plan. (Basically everyone would qualify for up to 2 years of community college paid for by the federal government\n\nReally shooting the moon on that one, eh? His plan is the one Obama already suggested only smaller?\n\nI thought Sanders was the stalwart champion providing solutions no one\'s thought of to problems no one is talking about.\n\n&gt;If you want to know the specifics of what he plans to do though, it shouldn\'t be that hard to figure it out.\n\nI like it! "Sanders totally has real policy plans, but he won\'t tell you, so you should dig through the pablum of his entire legislative career."'

aS"I'm 22 and I have never voted in my life.  And you know what?\n\nI won't vote this time either.  Even though I didn't vote for him, I was a pretty solid Obama supporter during his first campaign.  Opinion of him among the mainstream left at the time was nothing short of messianic, and he *still* burned us.  I feel no compunction to get invested in another cardboard candidate.  At best Sanders will turn out to be completely ineffectual and stonewalled by Congress, at worst he'll be another Obama - a great campaigner and a bad president.\n\nOur entire political system needs radical restructuring before anyone will have much faith in it after Obama.  Until then, I'm going to remain comfortably outside of it.  Sanders, Clinton, Bush - they can all go to hell.  Give me a call once someone has *actually* changed something, not just given me a band-aid and some sweet-talk."

aS"&gt;Do you really think minority voters would have huge turnout for an old white guy?\n\nIn my opinion, not at all.  COntrary to the reddit hivemind, I don't think Sanders has any significance chance to win the election.  He does have a role to play to bring up some economic issues, influence the conversation, and provide a foil to challenge Hillary from the left.  He will help Hillary in some respect by presenting a challenge, but may also push her to the left. \n\nI don't think Sanders could get turnout, so the answer to that part of your question is no. However, the more disturbing question is whether Hillary can turnout. \n\nI don't do campaign politics myself, I do have a number of friends that do work on campaigns.   They see get out the vote efforts as professional, but the disturbing question is whether Hillary can inspire people to turn out and vote. \n\n\n\n  \n\n"

Because what people are saying Sanders has "done" are bills which had no chance of passing.\n\nBut what I want to know is, if given Congress and the Senate, what does Sanders want to do (specifically, not the pablum of broad rhetoric like "make college more affordable"). Because if I don\'t agree with what he would do if he *could*, I won\'t support him.'
p1467
aS'I subscribe to his YouTube channel, but it seems like much more of a platform for posting his media appearances to me. That\'s great and everything, and good for people who want to see him actually working away. \n\nHe\'s got until next January before the actual voting starts to select a winner. That is more than enough time to carefully craft a plan to get way out ahead of Clinton and the rest of the pack in the digital age. He should make something like a 12 Step Program-style video series detailing the 12 largest macro issues currently facing American and conquer each on in a separate video. America needs to look in the mirror and make some choices. They need to grow up a little bit. Bernie Sanders talks the talk, and his campaign staff need to run what might be the most productive (per dollar spent) campaign that we\'ve seen in a very long time. The easiest way to do that is create well-produced YouTube videos that follow a simple formula.\n\n1) Confront issue right away. Make it specific and targeted, but meaningful. Something like how the American people line up like ducks in a row to vote for Hilary Clinton without even hearing a peep from her on specific policy while she\'s already raking in six figure donations from the people who put people on the streets in 2008 and beyond. Bring up the fact that likely millions of Americans feel lost and disenfranchised with their government, lives, and financial stability. No single person in the "greatest country in the world" should be crying themselves to sleep at night because they can\'t pay the rent even after working two or more jobs. The "Greatest Country in the World" should not be destroying nation states around the world in the name of freedom. Supporting rebel groups/governments in countries that leaned towards communism during the Cold War appears to have had devastating consequences globally ever since. What is a single person going to do with a salary of 80 million dollars, for example? They might give a lot of that money away to causes they support, but why have the middleman if they\'re supporting programs like the Salvation Army or the United Way? Why not redistribute that money and subsidize the poorest of the poor to get them off the streets? It\'s complex, but it should be confronted more. I could go on but there\'s more than enough material to get started.\n\n2) Give concrete evidence. Just like in the video, show *concrete* evidence that proves your point. Prove that things are completely fucked to the least intelligent of Americans. Open up their eyes to what\'s going on when they pay their taxes, or buy cheap shit at Wal-Mart because they can\'t afford goods from more ethical, high-quality stores. Open their eyes to just how much money so few people have. Maybe Bernie doesn\'t have that kind of charisma to make it that simple, but at the very least he has to get that ball rolling with a larger group of Americans.\n\n3) Provide a solution. Give us some good policy early. Explain what you would do and be a specific as humanly possible at this point.\n\n4) Carefully and easily explain how your policy will make things better. Try to anticipate what your opponents will try to spin you as, but assure the audience to make no mistake. You\'re here to play ball, and you\'re here to help level the playing field back to a more... sane state.\n\nTl;Dr: I agree. He\'s blowing up on SM, but he has to actually capitalize on it. He needs original content. Give us a State of the Union. Give us a Gettysberg Address. Blow away the American public with video after video every few weeks of the abhorrent problems plaguing the United States. Media appearances are great to have online, but that should only be 25% of his content or so. If he starts now, he\'ll be light years ahead of Clinton et al. come 2016. He will have mobilized an enormous group of youths and young professionals and likely alienated a small portion of voters, but that doesn\'t matter. He needs to re-invigorate this generation if anything at all. He can do that by using YouTube to it\'s full political potential.'
p1468
aS'&gt; And either pay out a lot more money to people who contributed above the $108k or screw anyone who did.\n&gt; Which will Sanders do?\n\nI thought I\'d sort of addressed that, but I didn\'t.\n\nThe thinking goes that the higher income earners would be propping up (so to speak) the Social Security program. This is really nothing new, since the more you earn, the more you pay in pretty much every other category of taxes. The social safety net (of which Sanders is the biggest proponent) is always paid by the people who don\'t need it, for obvious reasons.\n\nIt\'s "controversial" because it\'s effectively a tax increase and fiscal conservatives hate that. People will argue that it\'s a tax and that they get nothing out of it (which may or may not be true).\n\nOthers would argue that $108k is midlle to lower middle class in some places in a single earner household (which can be true).\n\nOthers will argue that this doesn\'t really hit the wealthiest because their money is all dividends, capital gains, etc (which is true).\n\nIf Sanders had his way, the cap would be removed, it would probably apply to capital gains, and the program would be means tested so that wealthy people get a small fraction of what the program pays out (or nothing).\n\nWhether he could accomplish *any* of that is a different story, but it\'s what he has said for a pretty long time.\n\nIt\'s crazy to think that just removing the cap fixes social security immediately, though.'

aS'You failed to address the insane spending on military power. We do pay enough in taxes. We do not get enough back for it because we basically turn it into napalm and burn it. Sanders gets that.

aS'&gt; Both you and the article have been saying that she mixed state and federal taxes in her claim, but then you go on to say she\'s only taking about state taxes\n\nYes, she mixed them. Her point was that undocumented immigrants pay taxes. She points to an article by Albor Ruiz titled ["Corporate giants often get huge tax breaks, while poor, undocumented immigrants have paid billions in state taxes."](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/corporate-giants-subsidized-undocumented-workers-article-1.2188061) Full stop. This is where she is purporting to get her information. \n\nSo, let\'s take a look at that article. It references a report from the [Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy.](http://www.itep.org/pdf/undocumentedtaxes2015.pdf)\n\nThe title of that report is "Undocumented Immigrants\' State and Local Tax Contributions."\n\nRuiz then compares that report and its findings to the website of Senator Sanders. That page is titled "Top 10 Corporate Tax Avoiders" and only purports to show that large corporations are not paying their fair share of **Federal Taxes.**\n\nShe mixed them, either intentionally or not. Either way, the mixture causes her statement to be false.\n\n&gt;Then there\'s the fact that nothing in the article links to an exclusive list of companies at play. \n\nDoesn\'t have to be. Clinton pointed to the website of Senator Sanders to point out the corporations that aren\'t paying taxes. Given that she\'s already couched her statement to specifically call out **New York** corporations, it doesn\'t make much sense to look at corporations that are not New York corporations, does it? One might call that cherrypicking to use data that is outside the scope.\n\nHere\'s the tl;dr of the Post fact checking:\n\n* Clinton statement: "Undocumented immigrants pay more taxes in New York than some New York corporations."\n* Post: *I wonder where she got that information.*\n* Clinton team: We used this article by Albor Ruiz\n* Post: Well, that article talks about the State and Local taxes that immigrants pay.\n* Clinton team: Sure does\n* Post: But it compares that to Federal income taxes that Senator Sanders says aren\'t being paid.\n* Clinton team: Yup\n* Post: Those aren\'t the same thing. \n* Clinton team: Well, undocs pay taxes.\n* Post: So too, do New York corporations, in larger numbers than undocs.\n* You: Why is the Post cherrypicking data to fact check a claim?'

He has these great speeches, but when he tries to elaborate about the speech he just gave, he paraphrases what the speech says, or he completely repeats some vague references to his speech.  The guy got me going as well until I started listening to him all the time and realized he is absolutely clueless and is just doing what he's told.

aS'Looking at the Wikipedia list of polls, I wouldn\'t be surprised if the number of candidates who had declared was having a strong impact as well.\n\nEven before Obama had declared, there wasn\'t a feeling that Hillary was the *only* choice - there were plenty of "not-Hillary" picks available in the field of candidates to siphon off her polling numbers.\n\nThis time around, especially with everyone focusing so much on the will/won\'t Warren declare question, and her repeated insistence that she won\'t, there\'s been a general feeling that Hillary is basically it, and that contributes significantly to her polling numbers.\n\nRight now, Sanders has been declared for, what, 2 or 3 weeks? So that perception is largely still there.\n\nNow, if 3 months down the line, people are more aware of Bernie and Hillary\'s numbers haven\'t fallen at all, and Bernie\'s haven\'t risen, at that point I\'d draw the same conclusion you have here - but I think that it\'s largely not possible to say how much the numbers we are seeing right now are influenced by the relative recency of Sander\'s declaring and the relative singular/bareness of the field prior to then, as compared to the way the field looked from the start of 2007 to the middle of 2007.'

aS'So [here\'s the results](http://imgur.com/a/9vXxV) of the GW Battleground poll of 1,000 Registered voters. It\'s a little bit easier to read visually like this (I feel) and draw your own conclusions.\n\nI am disappointed in one big thing with this survey: I\'m not the biggest Sanders fan in the world and I don\'t think he\'s got a chance in hell against HRC, but at the same time every poll in the last several weeks points to him as Hillary\'s (and I use this word loosely) biggest competition. Yet he is not included on this survey. It\'s a pretty big miss.\n\nThat being said, it\'s a pretty decent indicator of what the issues will be this time around: The Economy (23%), Jobs (14%) and Foreign Threats (12%), with the GOP seen stronger on Foreign Affairs (50-40%), slightly stronger The Economy (49-45%) and Dems in favor on Jobs (49-42%), though it will be quite interesting to how the GOP field (who has no candidate with meaningful foreign policy experience) stacks up against the former Secretary of State when it comes to foreign affairs. The poll becomes even murkier because even though "the economy" is seen as a top issue that generically favors Republicans, many of the the actual bread-and-butter issues that need to be addressed (Creating jobs, increasing wages and benefits, reducing healthcare and education costs) are traditionally Democratic causes and only a handful of voters prefer traditionally Republican causes such as deficit reduction (13%), tax cuts (7%) and regulation reform (7%).\n\nBut as far as the current crop of candidates is concerned, it\'s probably more accurate to say that Hillary Clinton is the candidate voters hate the least than like the most. And if Scott Walker is going to run for President, he needs to get in sooner rather than later because 47% of those surveyed have no idea who he is. But of those who have heard of him, at 19% he\'s got some of the lowest unfavorables polled. He has the strongest opportunity for growth out of the entire GOP field (excluding Carly Fiorina who seems to be off the radar of 60% of registered voters).\n\nThis is also a good to borderline excellent poll for Marco Rubio because out of all GOP contenders, when it comes to the people who have actually heard of him, 42% would consider voting for him - better than all other GOP challengers. Considering his (relatively) soft unfavorables (50%), he is currently in the best spot for becoming the 2016 GOP nominee, though 26% of voters still have no idea who he is.\n\nSo to sum up, it\'s the economy, stupid, again. The public generally thinks the GOP is better at it until you actually ask them about what\'s wrong and then the Democrats become the slight favorite. Foreign policy is surprisingly relevant this year and while the GOP is favored here again, it\'ll be interesting to see a party lacking candidates with bona fide foeign policy experience to take on America\'s former top diplomat on the issue. Voters are generally split on Hillary Clinton and Scott Walker and Marco Rubio have some homework to do on getting their message out because they both (but especially Rubio) are probably the best possible challengers to Jeb Bush who is becoming increasingly (60%!) unpopular.'

Both sides suffer from confirmation bias and will use scientific consensus only when it benefits their cause. \n\nFor example, there is near universal consensus among economists that free trade is a smart economic policy. That doesn\'t stop this sub from circlejerking whenever Bernie Sanders spouts off with some inane anti free trade argument. \n\n&gt; but lack of insurance couldnt possibly increase mortality?\n\nSure, it could. \n\nBut not to the extent that opposing mandatory insurance is supporting people "dying in the streets."

aS"You're right, it certainly does. But politics isn't about votes, it's about influence. Votes are a measure by which we determine whether or not a bill has passed. We also need to consider the things that lead up to that vote. Filibusters, deals being made, speeches, and campaigns for public opinion are all attempts to spread or use influence to change the vote.\n\nLook at Indiana. The vote count for RFRA was enough to pass, but the members of the political community of Indiana who opposed that bill shifted public opinion on the bill and used the influence that public opinion grants to create a massive outcry against the bill, ultimately ending in an amendment passing.\n\nThe thing about Warren and Sanders is that they are preaching views that a lot of liberals at this moment are really looking for, and so they gain an advantage in public opinion. That public opinion can then be used to both spread and use that influence to help oppose or support their efforts in the senate.\n\nAlso, Sanders winning the presidency would be huge for progressives. If people see that you can run a campaign without using super PACs and win the oval office based not on how much you spend but on what your views are, we will see more people using this strategy and using these same views to win other offices around the country.\n\nIt's not going to be a sudden change in January 2017, but it will be a good start toward changing the current political climate in the US toward something more favorable for progressives and, in my opinion, more favorable for the people."

Of those who view gun rights as an essential issue, and in particular those singe-issue voters, the vast majority will vote conservative because that's the side that supports the issue.  Republicans made huge gains in the last mid-term elections, and the issue of gun rights was a major part of that.  \n\nYes, Vermont is a liberal state that doesn't have a big gun control push.  They are the exception to the rule in that regard, particularly in that part of the nation.  And yes, Sanders doesn't push gun control largely because of that constituency.  I'm hoping he carries that through the election, because there's a huge block of voters all across the country with the same views.

She's been successful in large part because she knows how to reach out to historically right-leaning institutions and get them on board.  That's one reason the GOP hates the Clintons with a burning passion.  Business leaders and special interests that historically aligned with the GOP broke to support the Clintons in the 80s when Bill ran for governor and again in the 90s when he ran for President.\n\nIt should say something that Republicans don't really give a shit about Bernie Sanders.  He's not a threat to them, because he's not winning their base of voters to a more liberal political agenda.  Sanders is a great guy and a great Senator, but he's not a great coalition builder.

The levels of groupthink are insanely bad here due to the nature of the voting system.  You get downvoted for the wrong wording, or for questioning ingrained beliefs too heavily.  The same talking points are repeated heavily, and everyone knows the counters to every Republican statistic but gets upvoted for repeating Democrat.\n\nSimplest example: If you say "43% of poor people don\'t even pay income tax, we need to tax poor people more", everyone can *immediately* tell you how this statistic is a trick of numbers designed to make it look like poor people don\'t pay, because it\'s derived from federal income tax and excludes other taxes they do pay, and how the Republican party uses this statistic to manipulate it\'s voter base.\n\nBut if I say "The largest corporations pay less than 4% in net effective income tax, we need to tax corporations more", I\'d be showered in upvotes.  Attempts to explain why this statistic is *just as false* and explanations of how it is derived receive downvotes.  Why?  *Because this statistic agrees with Reddit\'s pre-existing opinion*.  Because people upvote based on *beliefs*, specifically, anti-corporate and Democrat, rather than discussion.  This stifles any true discussion, because only opinions that agree with people\'s existing beliefs will rise to the top.  \n\n(I actually had someone here tell me that while my explanation as to the falseness of that statistic made some sense, Bernie Sanders cited it, and he trusts Bernie Sanders over a random person on the internet when it comes to taxes.)\n\nThe most dangerous thing about /r/politics is that people can delude themselves in to thinking there\'s actual discussion going on here.'

It is legislation that directly benefits big oil companies and everybody else has to make up for that lost revenue.\n\nWhat is the difference if its in the form of a written check or off of taxes?  The end result is the same: This legislation is Bernie supporting the government subsidizing big oil.  After this legislation the big oil companies would end up with less of the Federal Tax burden.\n\nTax writeoffs are a common way to package subsidies, this isn\'t anything new, stop acting like it is.\n\nBernie is a corporate shill, deal with it.'

aS'Subsidy has a specific definition for governmental entities: "a sum of money granted by the government or a public body to assist an industry or business so that the price of a commodity or service may remain low or competitive."\n\nWhat Senator Sanders refers to are not subsidies.\n\n1) Money is not being granted by the federal government (state governments in the article were in fact giving subsidies). Deductions are being taken at an earlier time than would be allowed otherwise without the specific oil and gas tax provisions. Total dollar amounts are unchanged, merely timing differences.\n\n2) These tax breaks do not affect the price of the commodity. As I stated in a different comment, oil companies like Exxon do not control enough market share to alter the market price of oil.\n\nSo, yes, these federal tax provisions are beneficial to oil and gas companies, but they are not subsidizing them. \n\nI personally believe that many of the preferential items given to oil and gas companies should be removed like the immediate deduction of Intangible Drilling and Development Costs or the short term amortization of Geological and Geophysical surveying costs (both of which Senator Sanders\' proposal eliminate).\n\nHowever, some of the other provisions that Senator Sanders put forth in the bill that go too far and hurt oil companies as opposed to putting them on equal footing with the rest of the tax code. Additionally, several of the proposals that he puts forth do not affect large oil companies, which his bill claims are the targets of the piece of legislation (Percentage depletion and part of the IDC deduction). They only hurt smaller oil companies that are currently going through a very hard time economically given the current price of oil.'

aS'No it doesn\'t\n\n&gt;A subsidy is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (or institution, business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economic and social policy.[1] Although commonly extended from Government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support - for example from NGOs or implicit subsidies. Subsidies come in various forms including: **direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect (tax breaks, insurance, low-interest loans, depreciation write-offs, rent rebates).[2][3]**\n\nBut you\'ll never get anywhere arguing semantics.\n\nWhy not argue based on the spirit and principle of the legislation, instead of the meaningless semantics?  Everybody else considers tax breaks subsidies.  If you and Mr. Sanders don\'t that\'s your guys decision to not adopt the same meaning everybody else uses.  \n\nThe legislation makes the tax burden less for the companies it is aimed it, and more for everybody else.  This creates more of a burden for the average American tax-payer that must make up for that lost revenue.  Bernie Sanders signed off on it.\n\nSo We\'ll reword it from: "Bernie is for subsidizing big oil companies"\n\nto: "Bernie is in favor of giving big rich oil companies preferential treatment when it comes to how they pay taxes to the Federal Government"\n\nTo avoid the confusion and semantic debates. \n\nhttp://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-federal-tax-expenditures\n\nhttp://www.earthtrack.net/depth-tax-subsidies\n\n'

Even the original Supreme Court decision was partisan.

You seriously believe she\'ll raise at least $1.25 billion directly from banks? I find that extremely hard to believe. Her Senate campaign had a lot of donors from banks, but it was almost entirely from individuals who work there and not even from bank PACs. Which makes it mostly meaningless. I would be counted in that if I donated and am far from an anti-regulation, anti-rich people tax, corporate shill. The numbers from banks still weren\'t overwhelming compared to the total, [approx. 10%](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=n00000019&amp;type=I) which makes your "mainly from banks" comment even more unlikely and her whole PAC total was barely 1%. Individual contributions are 88%.\n\nEither way, don\'t hate the player, hate the game. I hate the whole concept of these stupid Super PACs as much as anyone, but it\'s the only way anyone *including Sanders* will have a chance of winning when the other side will most definitely use them and every other dirty trick in the book to win. There\'s almost no chance Citizens United will be solved before the 2016 election, especially with a Republican majority in both houses.

aS"&gt; Bernie Sanders can't win the general.\n\nThis might end up being true, but it seems so stupidly self defeating to not at least wait for the public to get to know him, and see what the polling information is like after that.  I might eventually join you in that strategic primary vote for Hillary, but there's literally no data yet to suggest that is the case.  Really the only data that currently exists shows that Hillary is doing fine and doesn't need your vote, while Bernie needs as many votes as he can get just to look like a somewhat serious candidate, and making his stances look more serious as a result.\n\nThere's just no reason to stake a strategical position like that long before the data is in, when the only purpose that serves is insuring the data goes in the wrong direction from the start.\n\nI really have no problem with people voting for Hillary because they think Sanders is too radical and they like Hillary better, but I find it extremely annoying when people that do supposedly support Sanders seem to prefer to take self defeating positions long before such strategical moves are smart or necessary."

aS"&gt; If people like Bernie Sanders had their way, they'd outlaw this and people in poorer countries wouldn't be lifted out of poverty.\n\n*Outlaw*? Of course not. They would always be free to pay a Ukranian programmer the same as they would pay an American programmer, and in reality they'd be able to pay them less, just probably not all the way down to a tenth of the American's pay. Helping people in other countries is a noble goal, but sacrificing our middle class hasn't worked very well so far and it doesn't look like it will help any better to sacrifice the rest of it. There's certainly not enough wealth left in our middle class to make a dent in global poverty.\n\nOn the other hand, if outsourcing is regulated and taxed appropriately, Americans will be able to face the true cost of living for our lifestyle and can make honest decisions about what is a fair minimum wage, what social security should *really* pay, and how much foreign aid we actually share with the world. Our current system obscures the true costs of those low price tags at Walmart and the true magnitude of the foreign aid we're sending in the form of jobs we can't actually spare."

aS'It would never be ruled legal to  tax specific corporations like that. Anyone who tried would lose their next election. Imagine the campaign ads... "Bernie Sanders wants to penalize American companies with huge tax penalties that foreign companies don\'t have to pay." '

aS'Not really at all when you actually take a second to think about it. What causes the U.S. to lose jobs abroad? The shit ton of cheap labor in foreign countries. So free trade agreements that lower international barriers to trade, ie protections for domestic companies, tend to export jobs while supposedly benefitting efficiency (which often translated into increased profits for investors and less jobs for the laborers.) Sanders seems to oppose such agreements that would continue along this trend of making it easier for corporations to outsource work.'

aS'Republicans do not want them voting, and democrats typically like to concentrate efforts into rallying women, minorities, etc.  There have been major programs to encourage young people to vote, MTV hosts their Rock the Vote program encouraging involvement (people watch MTV?? Idk but they used to when this program started decades ago).\n\nUnregistered/unaffiliated voters is a huge untapped market.  Most of them do not vote purely out of apathy.  It is actually amazing to me that this election seems to be peeling back that stigma.  Young people will stand up, and do so with an unstoppable agenda when you give them something worth fighting for.  Sanders seems to be rallying this group more than I have ever seen any political candidate do in his/her career.  Sure, Obama was a master of tapping into the non-voters.  He played the race card and got support from a massive amount of minorities.  Clinton reaches out to women.  Sanders though, is the first candidate I have ever seen that has people, especially young voters who suddenly are interested. High schoolers starting campaign programs to raise awareness for him from teachers and other parents.  College kids who are making sure their ducks are in a row so they can choose which state their vote will be more beneficial in.\n\nFirst candidate you will see who unites young (and old) people around a cause and a person they truly believe in.  No attention to skin, gender, religion, he is catching the attention of those too meek or too apathetic to have believed any of this matters.'

Bernie Sanders is the most on-the-mark, consistent, honest politician I've seen talk, and I think this speech is brilliant. He certainly has my vote and, regardless of whether he wins, he is reshaping the political landscape of the election and he knows it. Voting and supporting him, regardless of the outcome of the election, will only serve to further this immensely positive alteration of the political landscape in the nation.\n\nEveryone knew these were issues, but our politicians have downplayed and ignored them for a long time. All it took was someone from the inside to rise up and start speaking out about it in a straightforward, consistent, and unrelenting way. And Bernie's doing just that. I just think this is remarkable.\n\nEDIT: And that's not to downplay the voices and work of grassroots efforts, third party candidates and supporters, and the general people of America. It's all played a role, it seems like it's all coming to something of a fore. He's just actually voicing what a considerable number of Americans, often the majority, want and believe. And he hasn't adjusted his views to match them: they've been pretty consistent all along. On the contrary, it looks like the political climate in the nation has begun to come in line with what he's been fighting for and saying for years."

aS"I think the answer is actually pretty straightforward. We know that public opinion has much less to do with federal law making than just about anything else. Personally I don't think it's a matter of politicians intentionally going against the electorate, I think it's much more that DC is an echo chamber. Those politicians only interact with each-other, lobbyists, and their wealthy benefactors. \n\nI think Sanders is important. I think that maybe a meaningful portion of the public might be able to coordinate enough to form a potent political message and platform. But I don't think anything is guaranteed, and I'm not sure that there's even a fair chance any of positive change is coming anytime soon. \n\nOne other thing, in terms of public opinion, in my experience state level politicians are much more connected and responsive to public opinion, and it may be the case that meaningful change will have to start with a few positive example states.

I'm sure that if you ask him, he'll say that he wants to see the means of production provided to the workers, but it's not like you can just walk into congress and introduce legislation to make that happen.

And most of that federal debt was incurred paying for private torture at places like Abu-Ghraib, or [pumping heroin into your neighborhood.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1v18c5/is_there_any_correlation_between_the_heroin/)\n\nJust some things to think about.

aS"I fully agree with your comment.  We live in a capitalistic society, not a socialistic one.  In the end, if we don't expand the base of capital, then there's no point in talking about workers' well-being.  It doesn't work the other way around...just because we cater to workers' well-being does not make our country wealthier, nor does it make our products competitive.\n\nIronically, given what Sanders was talking about in the video, China is a perfect case study for the failures of socialism.  Their SOEs (state-owned enterprises) were reknown for providing life-time employment and relatively generous retirement benefits.  Those SOEs were also ridiculously uncompetitive and did not become competitive globally until they acquired significant private ownership, much of which entailed slashing worker compensation and adding insecurity to workers' lives."

aS'&gt;So? h1-b visas are supposed to be about experienced workers.\n\nIt\'s about attracting the best of the best.  Experience alone does not own a monopoly on determining what is best.  Having a top-tier education is as much if not far more important.\n\n&gt; The US has a ton of fresh grads for the jobs. h1-b visas are used to depress wages.\n\nAnd many of them are outshined by H1-B graduates.  There simply aren\'t that many to begin with at any rate.  I know post-doctorates from India who, after completing their studies at a top-tier US institution, still cannot find work here and are thinking about returning to India.  It\'s tough for everyone.\n\n&gt; "They only came to the US for a masters degree because it only takes 2 years and gives you the student visa you need to easily get a job in the US and convert to an h1-b visa. They do not get any education from the US, india has a perfectly functional university and schooling system for those that pay for it.\n\nYou say "they do not get any education from the US" but then state that they got a masters degree here before applying for H1B, again, more than likely at a top-tier US university.\n\n&gt;"The indian workers will accept less pay.\n\nYes, I know, this was my whole point about the H1B process being a microcosm for the globalized labor market.  In the end, even if you shut down things like H1B, you\'re still going to have capital chasing after cheap labor.  Anyone who\'s taken a basic business course knows that labor is a cost to be marginalized, and is typically by far the largest cost in any operation.  Again, Sanders brings up some excellent talking points, but shutting the US out of the global marketplace may not be the best solution to the side effects of globalization, even if one of those side effects is the "hollowing out" of the US job market.  There has to be another solution, and unfortunately, a basic course in economics would tell you that if supply of something goes way up (shift in the curve to the right), the price is going to go way down (movement of equilibrium price along the curve to the right).  This means that wages are going to continue to be depressed.  One possible solution is to shrink the pool of labor, but I\'m sure most people (including myself) would balk at killing people just because my wages are depressed.'

aS"&gt;  One of the most important reasons I think so many Americans oppose socialism is our deeply held core value of freedom to spend our money how we like, which exorbitant taxes strangle\n\nMaybe, but Sanders isn't proposing exorbitant taxes, nor have we ever seen in the entire history of the United States taxes so high that it strangled the economy.

aS'&gt; It\'s about attracting the best of the best. Experience alone does not own a monopoly on determining what is best. Having a top-tier education is as much if not far more important.\n\nNo it is not.  h1-b visas are supposed to be about experienced workers you cannot get locally.  Not the best of the best.  If there is a US worker that can do the job, even if only 90% as well as the indian, you are supposed to hire the US worker.\n\nThat is how the h1-b visa system legally is supposed to work. You have no valid justification for claiming otherwise.\n\nh1-b abuse doesn\'t change what h1-b visas are actually for.  A lack of regulation and enforcement doesn\'t make you right. It only makes you more wrong.\n\n&gt;And many of them are outshined by H1-B graduates\n\nFalse.  I haven\'t met a single h1-b visa hire/co-worker that would be better than someone I went to school with who graduated.  There is so much extra teaching you have to do with an h1-b visa hire because they don\'t understand how people in the US think.  I would put an h1-b visa hire at requiring at least twice as long to train.  They also have a lower ceiling on how good they can get.\n\n&gt;I know post-doctorates from India who, after completing their studies at a top-tier US institution, still cannot find work here and are thinking about returning to India. It\'s tough for everyone.\n\nJust because they failed their attempt at using a student visa to get an h1-b visa doesn\'t mean much.  If they don\'t have minimal language skills many places won\'t hire them.  Indians with poor language skills are competing against the indians with better language skills.\n\nAlso, it shouldn\'t be tough for them, it should simply not be an option for them to get a job in the US when we have more than enough US grads to employ.\n\nThey have no right to a job in the US, they are not US citizens.  They have no right to even be in the US.\n\n&gt;Yes, I know, this was my whole point about the H1B process being a microcosm for the globalized labor market. \n\nNo, it is just one more way politicians have fucked over the US worker by making us compete more and more with cheaper less skilled labor that businesses deem, "good enough".\n\n &gt;Again, Sanders brings up some excellent talking points, but shutting the US out of the global marketplace may not be the best solution to the side effects of globalization\n\nWe aren\'t shutting ourselves out of anything.  What has h1-b visas gotten us?  US citizens can\'t easily go to other countries and get a job, why should their people have an open door into the US job market?'

aS'That has never been the sole purpose for tariffs, but it does provide a viable basis for restoring them since they can help prevent the race to the bottom of the labor market that Free Trade has ushered in.\n\nWhy are lower wages a problem?  The refusal of the business community to lower what they charge for products and services in the face of falling wages only serves to result in widespread poverty, the escalating loss of consumer demand and eventually the collapse of the economy.  Economist John Maynard Keynes touched on this when he identified the economic "death spiral" that resulted in the Great Depression.\n\nObama is tragically mistaken to assume that Free Trade has ever been in this nation\'s best interest.  U.S. economic metrics and trends prove as much.\n\nDon\'t even think about comparing Rand Paul to Warren or Sanders, Paul comes much closer to Barack Obama on trade than he does to either Warren or Sanders on this issue.  Obama is embracing the tragically misguided Libertarian/Conservative position on Free Trade, not the sensible Progressive/centrist economic positions advocated by Warren and Sanders.

In the context of the US, that's almost radical.\n\nI think the spotlight on him is great, and as a socialist I'm glad to see someone like him make it less of a dirty word.

aS'I know not everyone here is going to want to read the history of the socialist movement in Europe or the US, but I think to understand why many Leftists (especially Leninists like myself) are going to be on about how Sanders isn\'t "really" a socialist: it\'s good to review the [history of the split within the international socialist movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International#Failure_of_the_Second_International) which led to there being Socialist parties and Communist parties.\n\nSo in places like Sweden, France, Spain, Greece, etc. when talk about the "socialists" is indeed quite mainstream, they\'re interestingly not really talking about transitioning their countries to socialist societies but rather about reforming their capitalist countries.\n\nThis leads to some confusion in discussion here when people talk about the current "socialist countries in Europe, like Sweden." Sweden is a capitalist country, they have a capitalist class, free markets, workers sell their labor on a labor market, etc. It\'s a very different *form* of capitalism in that it has a very strong welfare state but it is still a capitalist country. "Actual" socialists would much rather capitalist countries look like Sweden than the United States, but neither are "socialist."\n\nThis may be nitpicking, but I predict that this topic will come up quite a lot more as Sanders\' campaign gets going.'

aS"And really, I think Sanders is just confused by the myriad of terminology. Either that, or he's just moderating his message a tad to be more palatable. . .because most of what I've heard from him is what *honest* social democrats would say.

aS"&gt;  a welfare state\n\nYou say this as something with bad connotation I feel. And indeed with existing social arrangements and policies that allow the Gov to mismanage and funnel the Social Security in favor of the 1% and creating [a whopping gap of 210 trillion of unfunded liability](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoodman/2015/05/13/power-to-the-people-can-we-privatize-the-welfare-state/) *it is a bad thing.* Why? An analysis of where this gap comes from and where and how the money for Social Security and Medical Security went is long time pending and needs a definite turn in social policies in order to reveal that. The American society is up for a crude awakening I guess. Will Bernie Sanders be able to do that on his own? I don't think so. In a oligarchy and plutocracy a single person is highly unlikely to change the course, I don't believe he will make it in the primaries either no matter of the 60% of Americans that agree with him as they are not the ones that prevail or voice their opinion thru the polls. It's the other 40% that vote. So good luck to Bernie though it's highly unlikely for him to get even the nomination of the Dems. As to the definition of Socialism, no matter how you twist it, it implies in itself democracy and is a tool of the majority thru the elected government to influence the economic mechanisms that allow citizens to bridge the inequality gap in a way that society does not split and respectively get into antagonistic class separation but on the contrary moves along as a whole. Cause growing inequality and class antagonism have one solution as it was noticed back in 1867 and it's inevitable.  "

p1606
aS'Okay, let me try this again.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders does not run on a "rich people are bad" platform.\n\nIn fact, it\'s attacking a straw man to suggest that he does.\n\nIt\'s extremely silly to argue that any economic change that doesn\'t favor all rich people in the short term is grounded in hostility toward rich people.\n\n**It is, in fact, a way of dismissing policy proposals without having to do any thinking.**\n\nI do indeed agree that many rich people are not bad.  My point was that those who aren\'t, don\'t indulge in the use of sterile slogans and straw man distortions to promote right wing policy.'
p1607
aS"Sanders is pretty much as socialist as they come as far as American politicians go though, and something tells me his whole economic vision isn't quite on the table yet.  I just don't want the U.S. to turn into one of those countries where 60% of your paycheck is withheld off the top."

The average voter is going to play it safe and vote Hilary. I can almost guarantee that Hilary is going to be the next president and America will be like "wooooh first female president" and whatnot.

His focus is the American Citizens - this guy is making a generalization that Sanders is a bad person by preventing poor people in a different country from getting jobs that would benefit them.\n\nThis author is implying that Sanders is on the side of the rich people being better off in exchange for other people suffering.  What?  Is this guy implying that Sanders is secretly backing rich people at the expense of poor people?  Does he have any fucking idea, at all, about what he is talking about?  Obviously not.\n\nThis is the kind of shit that is going to be dredged up against Sanders, because their is no shit.  It is full of lies, assumptions, and "implicit arguing".  There literally isn\'t an ounce of redeemable quality about this author.  I can respect an opposing viewpoint when it is fact driven, this is anything but.  His argument is some shit Ted Cruz would pull out of his ass.\n\nThe only people impoverishing people in other countries are their own countries - we don\'t pick their wages, we just use them because their wages are ridiculously cheaper than anything that can be afforded in the States.\n\nUS Jobs are one of our biggest exports, just ask China, India.\n\n\nThis article is literally complete shit\n\n**Unwarranted assumption fallacy - The fallacy of unwarranted assumption is committed when the conclusion of an argument is based on a premise (implicit or explicit) that is false or unwarranted.

aS"From a purely logical and scientific POV I think that Mr. Sanders is incorrect. Here's why:\n\nWe don't need to break our dependence on automobiles... we need to break our automobile's dependence on oil/gasoline for energy. Again, the issue is not cars, it's the gasoline cars use as fuel. \n\nIf all cars were hydrogen powered, their only emission would be water, and this instantly becomes a non-issue. \n\n\nThe car is clearly not going anywhere. Even with a *perfect* national rail system, there will still be hundreds of millions of people who need to drive every day. "

He is *far* left of where Hillary will be trying to convince everyone she is in the general election against a Republican, and he is *far* left of where she would be as president. Hillary Clinton has few if any discernible convictions, other than that she is owed the presidency. Sanders has been demonstrating his for decades."

p1647
aS"Listen, I adore Sanders but to claim that Hillary Clinton, who single handedly put universal healthcare on the country's radar at a time when most people hadn't even heard of the concept (while being First Lady no less), has no convictions is absurd. She has supported the DNC platform for decades faithfully.\n\nHillary Clinton doesn't feel like she is owed the presidency, she's just the obvious choice. As much as I love Sanders I think you are seeing heroism and not taking into account his relatively tiny electorate. Did Clinton win her Senate seat b/c she was owed it? She was First Lady (for a governor and a president), a senator and Secretary of State. She's obviously the most qualified overall, it's obvious.\n\nI posted a link to both of them on the issues and you'll see that they are not that far apart: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/35yc6l/clinton_has_vowed_to_protect_obamas_actions_on/cr97e43\n\nSanders is a bit more left, that's about it."

aS"The headline and the story associated with this poll is absolutely atrocious and misleading and misses the point completely BUT this is absolutely a very important poll, which, despite the Fox News moniker, was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw &amp; Company Research (R).\n\nIn the GOP at the national level, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson are tied at 13. Scott Walker is sitting at 11, Mike Huckabee is in at 10 and Marco Rubio rounds out the top five with 9. Rand Paul pulls in at 7 points and Chris Christie and Ted Cruz are sitting on the outside of the bubble with 6. All other challengers are polling under 5 points.\n\nThe Dems meanwhile have nearly unified behind Hillary Clinton with 63% support. Elizabeth Warren comes in second with 13 and Bernie Sanders is tied with Joe Biden in third with 6 points each.\n\nMeanwhile in head to head matchups, Clinton edges out almost all potential general election challengers. Only Jeb Bush in the entire GOP field is able to best Clinton at +1, which is well within the margin of error.

As much as it pains me to say it, so long as climate change is causing issues that can be planned or managed around only small incremental changes will fly within public policy.\n\nMassive shifts in government policy will get struck down by the courts.  It's smart to craft policy around how the world is, and not as you wish it was.\n\nAlso automobiles only account for 27% of all greenhouse gasses.  Does Mr. Sanders have policy viewpoints on curbs to ~~my prime rib~~ agriculture?"
p1651
aS'By *far* left, you actually mean that Bernie Sanders is standing at the political center.  There is absolutely nothing centrist about the Reaganomic policy positions that Hillary embraces (e.g., refusal to break up too-big-to-fail banks, support for Free Trade, refusal to support meaningful socio-economic reforms aimed at restoring the middle class, etc.).  That makes her positions on economic and fiscal policy matters...***far, far*** right, not "*centrist*".  So, in a way, one could argue that Bernie is left of Hillary, but not "far" left wing.\n\nI don\'t buy the campaign rhetoric she has employed lately given the lion\'s share of advisors and insiders she has surrounded herself with, early indications of her policy preferences and her political history.'

That is why I applaud Mr Sanders but my guts says Clinton is the small change the world needs right now.\n\nAmerica has the responsibility around the world because of how big they became. Mr Sanders is not a good way to tell the world you are feeling responsible.\n\nDisclaimer - I am talking about how america needs a president that won't worry the capitalists in China, Japan, Germany, UK, etc... who own half of america's debt."

aS'Sanders exists in this race for the purpose of pulling Hillary further left. A far left candidate such as Sanders makes Hillary almost look conservative forcing her to adjust and woo back the Democratic vote after Sanders so called "steals the vote".\n\nNo one under any means should believe Sanders is a true candidate.

Then theres the agenda embraced byElizabeth WarrenandJoseph Stiglitz, which is focused more on reforming rigged financial rules and deep structural problems that have exacerbated inequality"\n\nIt paints the picture that Warren and Sanders do not believe in boosting wages, economic mobility, and infrastructure.  If you have ever listened to either of them speak, those three issues make up the bulk of what they talk about.   I also find it strange how they say the Democrats work to "boost wages" while it says Warren is trying to "reform... deep structural problems that have exacerbated inequality."  Boosting wages for the middle and lower class causes a decrease in inequality.  \n\nI think the Washington Post made the Democrats sound better than the liberals on purpose.  The newspaper is owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, who has backed several Democratic campaigns of Representatives and Senators.   He wants to make sure that it\'s his Democrats to stay in power.  For years Billionaires have controlled our media; now they control our Congress, and that my friends, is very frightening indeed.   '

Just because the first time you heard about it was a Bernie Sanders YouTube video on reddit doesn't mean he was the first person to think it or say it. Guess what, both HRC and Sanders are going to share a lot of views because they are both democrats. It doesn't mean that either of them are stealing ideas from each other.

I big fat load of shit. It\'s something no one is asking for. Fix the fucking roads instead. How about instead of finding new ways to fuck me over and take my car privileges away the govt fix up all their flawed systems that are in place. Instead of social engineering, they do some actual infrastructure engineering. Instead of getting rid of cars, find a new source of energy so our cars don\'t have to use gas and the country isn\'t dependent on foreign oil, or ruins it\'s own land by drilling out the domestic oil.\n\nThe only reason anyone on reddit is for this idea is because Bernie "Dank Memes" Sanders said it. Imagine if a Republican said to invest billions into the rail roads. People would be like what the fuck. There are bigger problems we need to invest our money in, and which corporation benefits from this bright idea? But not old Bernie, the millenials are like please take my money new Jesus, we will blindly follow you to the ends of the earth. Investing in old tech like rail roads isn\'t any kind of solution to any problems that we currently face. Money needs to be invested into research into alternate forms of transportation and energy.'

aS'&gt; First, why are you resurrecting a 2 month old post?\n\nDunno, felt like speaking my mind. Its not like you\'re obligated to reply or anything.\n\n&gt;just because people agree with a politician that certain things are problems doesn\'t mean that they agree with the politician on what the solution is\n\nAgreed, good point. However it does indicate that Sanders has struck a nerve with the American people. There\'s not too many solutions available for these issues either. If you believe the rich pay too little in taxes, the obvious solution is to raise taxes on the top income brackets, which is exactly what Sanders is proposing. If you think that climate change is an issue, the obvious solution is that you want Washington to stop ignoring it. Its not like there\'s a wide selection of solutions to choose from. Vote republican and all those issues will remain unsolved. Vote for Hillary and you\'ll get the same results. Vote for Sanders, you might just get some of it adressed. Overall, I\'d say its unfair to say that "the vast majority of people just don\'t want a far left candidate". Besides, he\'s been polling at 13% in New Hampshire and 15% in Iowa, only days after announcing that he\'s running.'

aS'&gt;Great - that\'s not his job though.\n\nWhat do you mean not his job? Congress can\'t pass laws regulating the auto industry, or mandate hydrogen cars by a certain time? Oh wait, they can! \n\n\n&gt;clearly his bill will support manufacturing and purchasing such automobiles.\n\nUm..... proof? I didn\'t see any mention of hydrogen vehicles in the article nor have I heard Mr. Sanders ever even talk about them. So, unless you can provide evidence to support that "clearly" claim... i call BS. \n\n&gt;Now manufacturing those cars in a commercially accessible manner is on the manufacturers (looking at you Tesla - I am so not dropping $30K on a car).\n\nTesla makes battery powered electric cars... not hydrogen cars.\n\nAnd you\'re wrong anyway. History has taught us that if left to their own devices, the REAL big auto manufacturers (aka not tesla, which is tiny... more like Chevy, Ford,  etc) won\'t care about the environment unless we force them to.. thats why we have CAFE fuel economy standards from the government. \n\n\n&gt;Let\'s not forget that a lot of people need public transport. Science can sometimes leave some people behind.\n\nNobody is saying we shouldn\'t expand public transit. You\'ll notice I never said that. \n\nWhat i was pointing out is that building an effective rail system wont kill our dependence on the car. Look at Europe, with a near perfect rail system,  and still hundreds of millions of people drive. \n\nAlso the science can leave some people behind... can you explain what you meant by that? Because i think you\'re conflating what i said with the price of a Tesla... which would be a misunderstanding\n\n&gt;We need good policy now and that\'s what Sanders is doing.\n\nI disagree.  In fact that was the entire point of my post.  That sanders claim was incorrect: his policy suggestion would not break our dependence on cars. And it won\'t, as evidence by Europe, Japan, China and many other places with great public transit, systems we would model ours after, still have TONS of cars.\n\n\n'

Sure, they have to compromise with their family, friends, boss, significant other, they compromise on where they live, or work, or go to school,  They compromise on which car they buy, which sports team they back, which shirt they buy.  But when it comes to politics - "the art of compromise" - there can be NO COMPROMISE!  What these people really want *is to make themselves feel better at the voting booth*,  not to move the country slowly toward a better place.  They will stamp their feet and hold their breath until they can vote - without compromise.\n\nBut most are just young, naive, and lazy.  They don\'t want to fight for change the way that the freedom riders did, or the SDS.

aS"yeah im confused why it's singling out Ted Cruz.  The article mentions that Rubio has missed 21% of roll call during his campaign and Cruz has missed 18%, Rand Paul has missed only 1%.  McCain and Obama missed 64% and 53% roll calls respectively during their campaign for the president.  The article neglects to mention how many votes Sanders missed since he has declared candidacy but I'm assuming none since he just declared.\n\nIf GQ wanted a clickbait title based around the theme that sitting Senators/Congresspersons shouldn't be derelict in their duties while running for president, then why didn't it single out Rubio in its title since he's missed more votes?  That seems to be the crux of the entire article anyways"

p1709
aS"As much as I'd love to see her not get nominated, we all know Sanders getting it is a long shot. Not that I have anything against him, but it's the whole electability in the general thing. No matter how much his positions resemble what people *actually* want (and they are) he'll be really easy to beat up on as a soft liberal and a lot of people will vote against him because they know it.\n\nHope he'll find a way around that, though.

And trust me, its not a favorable one.  Once you hit a certain age you realize all (and I mean all, Paul and Sanders included) are completely full of shit so you stop listening to them.

aS"Heh, I usually agree with everything posted here, but I think marijuana and all other recreational drugs have a negative impact on society. Alcohol is too culturally ingrained to get rid of, but I would fight to prevent the legalization of MJ. I reckon Singapore has the right idea when it comes to drug laws- that shit should be banned and enforced heavily. \n\nI'm fine with it being used medically, but recreational use make no sense. I'll be honest, after the first time I used, I thought weed was the best thing ever. But even a crack addict likes the feeling initially. Marijuana, like all other recreational drugs and mind altering substances is bad for you. I have friends who developed anxiety as a result of a bad trip and I've read loads of articles/ papers where it triggered schizophrenia and psychosis in otherwise healthy individuals. There are also so many studies out there showing that it could have a negative impact on IQ. While it seems benign to casual users, things can take a turn for the worse very easily.\n\nThat shit is addictive too and people go through legit withdrawals trying to get of it. Weed should bloody well remain illegal and I'm no Jesus freak. The one reason I'm not going to be voting for Bernie Sanders is because of his weed policy.\n\nThe worst part is that some people would actually go as far as to legalize the hard psychedelics like LSD because they have very little physical effect."

aS"This is the main reason why I like the fact that Bernie Sanders is running. Sure, his chances of winning the primary are pretty slim, against the likes of Hillary Clinton. . .but if he can make enough noise *and* garner enough support from delegates during the primary (just 15-20% would do, I think, given Sander's political leanings), it'll demonstrate to those in power in the Democratic Party that the left wing of the party is not to be ignored, and that the left wing of the party is becoming dissatisfied with centrists tossing them crumbs."
p1728
aS"This is classic right-wing talking points and why a ton of low-income voters are voting against their best interests. \n\nThe fact is they are being *exploited* by an organization that receives a ton of value from what they do, and they aren't being compensated fairly. They need to be paid a livable wage for the labour they give to the organization instead of being given a t-shirt or lawn poster. (Which, ironically enough is just another way for the organization to advertise, not a true method of payment). It's sad that people have been so brainwashed that they pretend that working for $0/hr is somehow a good thing. What happened to the idea that you should be paid fair wages for fair work? Bernie Sanders is a capitalist exploiter."
p1729
aS"&gt; Sander's campaign has around 200,000 volunteers already. After four days of fundraising, his campaign got $4 million. If all those people signed up and did one hour of work, at $15 an hour, they would already take up $3 million. Sander's campaign will not be able to get even $1 million in grassroots funding a day. \n\nAnd again, I don't understand what this has to do with paying people a fair value for their labour? Am I supposed to cry that Sanders has millions while the people who slave away for him have to work long hours to just feed their children? I don't feel sorry for him, and I don't *care* if he can afford it or not. If he can't afford it, then don't take the *time* away from your workers without fair payment. End of story. If he can't afford it, maybe he shouldn't have created a national campaign. If you want people to work for you, you *HAVE* to pay a fair wage. \n\n&gt;If you don't see the value of this cause, then I feel bad for you.\n\nI DO see the value in the cause. What I *don't* see value in, is a person being paid *nothing* for hours that are taken away from their friends and family. And those same people actually thinking it's in their best interest to be paid nothing! It's a race to the bottom I guess."
p1730
aS"Let's put it this way; if I weren't working for the Sanders campaign, I'd be organizing for them independently and I *still* wouldn't be getting paid.\n\n&gt; Am I supposed to cry that Sanders has millions\n\nYeah, Sanders net worth is like 330k. I don't know why you're conflating the campaign's account with his personal wealth.\n\nI see what you're doing, but the comparison you're trying to make between the capitalist exploitation of workers and organized political action is... ridiculous.\n\nAs a troll, I give it 5/10."
p1731
aS"Ralph Nader was a spoiler candidate. He knew he had barely two percent of the vote and it was just enough to toss the election to the republicans. \n\nConsidering how psychotic and unreasonable the republican party is these days, we can't even pretend to be noble about the democratic system. You either have to win the democratic primary or you drop out. At least Bernie Sanders knows how important this is."
p1732
aS"You are totally right in some initiatives she has put together, and I don't doubt them. What I do want to say is that Sanders has a much better long term history of working with congress to put together progressive policy that Hillary lacks. Sanders voted against doma in the mid nineties, NAFTA cafta etc. And Sanders critique of these programs has remained consistent.  Also Sanders actually appears to me to be a man with much greater conviction and willing ness to get things done because he wants to implement historical reform rather than rearrange the furniture as I experienced as Clinton's senatorial constituent. \n\nIf you are undecided simply browse r/Sanders for president videos and see a direct but thoughtful man who can roundly win in the primary and national election. His logic really appeals to common business sense for the american working population. It is important to really know who you vote for in a primary."

aS'Edit: To be fair, the person I replied to stated that they would take someone who "doesn\'t understand the economy" over someone who "prefers to ruin our economy for " (something or other).\n\nAt which point I said if you don\'t understand it, you\'re likely to ruin it.   At which point they decided to bring up Bernie Sanders for some reason....(?)\n \n--------\nNot understanding == ruining our economy.\n\nSorry. Doesn\'t work.    \n\n&gt; Bernie Sanders is attempting to follow the model of many bankrupt European countries. \n\nNope.

Unfortunately, I don\'t think Sanders will be allowed to inject his views and values into this election campaign. The powers at hand won\'t allow it.

What it generally means is that it's not *authoritarian* socialism.\n\nStop trying to use the term 'Democratic Socialist' as if it's a 'watered down' version of socialism. That isn't the case. Bernie Sanders is somewhere between being a social democrat and a socialist. He advocates worker control of businesses, and other stuff that is actually along the lines of socialism/syndicalism, but most of what he actively talks about right now is along the lines of what an *honest* social democrat (one that actually backs up what they say) would say. . .because that is somewhat more acceptable in the eyes of a US public that's been conditioned to loathe anything called 'socialist'.\n\nNorway, Sweden, and Finland aren't democratic socialist societies, they are social democracies.

Suits will be brought, they will be thrown out, and very solid case law will be built protecting the gun industry, just as it is with other industries, and it will not have relied on removing the right of Americans to have their day in court.\n\nAs it is now, however, the facts cannot be heard.  Anyone with even a potential case cannot try to make it and lose, thanks to the NRA they have been pushed out of the legal system. It is a bill designed to ensure facts are never heard.\n\nIt is nefarious no matter what industry it is because it is an example of a lobbying organization writing legislation favorable to their clients, making it, in their words, "Their number one legislative priority," and then spending as much money as is necessary to get Congress to pass that law giving their clients special rights.  That is a disaster for fairness under the law and a perfect example of how the American system is for sale.  How you don\'t see it as nefarious is either naive or short-sighted.\n\nBernie Sanders asserting this reflects his desire to limit the influence of corporate power and money in politics is completely absurd.'
p1755
aS"Yeah, except this isn't about corporate power. It's about common sense. You keep assuming that I don't *understand*. You're wrong; I disagree with your assessment of the law. I think it's perfectly reasonable, and I'm glad Sanders voted for it.\n\nAnd I'm FAR from an NRA gun nut; I'm just a citizen that thinks holding manufacturers liable for misuse of their product is absurd. Like I said, the problem is that the situation even needed clarification.\n\nWhich of course it did, because too many people think gun manufacturers *should* be liable for crimes committed with guns. I still suspect you might be such a person, despite your claim to the contrary. Nobody else should think this law is nefarious.\n\nAgain, just because the NRA supported it *doesn't* mean it wasn't sensible legislation. Sometimes corporations or lobbyists just *happen* to be on the right side of an issue, even if I usually disagree with them."

aS"Bernie Sanders is doing the best job laying out the case that this is a corporate power grab, and basically an assault on democracy and hence all of us.  I wish more people could hear this message.  From [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-fawXeTxlE&amp;t=673): \n\n&gt; Unbelievably, what this legislation is prepared to do is to undermine basic democracy in terms of what local communities around the world, states in the United States, national goverments, whether it's the United States or any other government, does if it undermines future profits of large multinational corporations.  That's really extraordinary.  I thought that our job [as elected officials], people democratically elected all over the world... I had the idea that maybe their function was to represent as best they could the needs of the people who voted for them. ...\n\n&gt; It's an attack on the fundamental tenets of democracy.  Our job is not to worry about future corporate profits. Our job is the worry about the needs of the American people, and that is what elected governments all over the world are supposed to do."

aS"I second this, he has great rhetoric but that is about as far as it goes.  It's great to say you want to reign in banks, stop drone killings abroad, scrap the TPP etc...but saying that and actually having a comprehensive plan to accomplish it are two different things. In addition to that you still have congress to deal with on anything you want to get done and he doesn't have the political clout to rally his own party, let alone an opposing party hell bent on cock-blocking any idea he has ever conceived. And lets not forget he is threatening the very people who fund our entire political system.

Sanders is vehemently opposed to the TPP not just due to environmental and legal concerns involving corporations, but also due to the fact that it can cost American jobs. We the people don't even know the full details of this deal because apparently if we do, we wouldn't like it (Can't remember where I read this).\n\nAnd there is the issue of the PACs. https://youtu.be/X6GzfqahHJA\nI feel like Hillary would go down the same path of cognitive capture that Obama did, unlike Sanders who refuses super PAC funds. \n\nHillary's funding : https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=n00000019\n\nBernie : https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00000528"

Just [yesterday](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7293066) she said she would only appoint SCOTUS justices who would overturn Citizens United. Sanders is certainly well left of her, but on the surface of most issues they're very similar. The exception to that might be health care which she hasn't expanded very much on since Obamacare has received so much negative attention.\n\nAnd let's be honest, proposing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United in Congress? Well intentioned but there was no way in hell that was going to make it anywhere. "

Sanders has been vocal about the terrible decision since it was made, introduced legislation to overturned it, and DAYS before Hillary made the comment had said "If elected president, I will have a litmus test with deciding Supreme Court justices. And it will be if they will overturn Citizens United" (He might have said McCutcheon too, I\'m not entirely sure). \n\nHe voted against the invasion in Iraq. She voted for it. He\'s rallied against Wallstreet reform and the power of the financial institutions. She\'s relished in it. He\'s in favor of universal healthcare. She has not made statements on it.

p1765
aS'&gt; Warren wouldn\'t even be considered in the "liberal wing" of the party if this was the 1980s, she\'d be a sensible centrist or even a moderate Republican. \n\nI don\'t agree with that at all. Reagan is the most conservative president of the post-war era; at the very minimum, congressional republicans support for him in the 80s would have made them far to the right of Warren. Not to mention that the house was under democratic control during the entire decade, and still allowed quite conservative measures through: at least some democrats would have been far to her right as well.\n\nTo put some numbers at it, we can look at the DW-Nominate score of people that served in the 80s in the house/senate and that still serve today. Using the [98th congress house](http://voteview.com/HOUSE_SORT98.HTM) (Jan. 1983- Jan. 1985) and [senate](http://voteview.com/SENATE_SORT98.HTM) as a starting point, and comparing to the only Warren senate we have full data for, [the 113th congress senate](http://voteview.com/SENATE_SORT113.HTM) (Jan. 2013 - Jan. 2015) [and the accompanying 113th house](http://voteview.com/HOUSE_SORT113.HTM) we have:\n\n* Ed Markey, 34th most liberal in the house at -0.522 in the 80s. In the present, he was the 28th most liberal in the house before moving to the senate.\n\n* Patrick Leahy, 12th most liberal in the senate with -0.386 in the 80s. Present is 18th in the senate.\n\n* Barbara Mikulski, 91st most liberal in the house, -0.385 in the 80s. Present is 19th in the senate.\n\n* Chuck Schumer, 105th most liberal in the house with a -0.362 score in the 80s. Present is 25th in the senate.\n\n* Carl Levin, 7th most liberal in the senate with -0.411 in the 80s. Present was 15th in the senate.\n\n* Harry Reid, 156th most liberal in the house with a -0.289 in the 80s. Present is 36th in the senate.\n\nYou get the idea. Where does Warren rank today? Most liberal in the senate, with a score of -0.622 -- that\'s a more leftist rank than even Sanders gets, at -0.523 and 3rd. It\'s also to the left of the most leftward person in the 98th senate, William Proxmire (-0.574), and would be in the top 10 for the 98th house. It\'s far less extreme than the republican scores are -- someone as conservative as she is liberal would be just the 10th most conservative senator today (the most conservative, Mike Lee, has a score of 0.991!). Or put another one: she would barely be in the top 20% of most extreme senators in the republican caucus, if she were to be as conservative as she currently is liberal.\n\nSo, no. Warren, as she votes and acts today, would absolutely *not* have been a "centrist or even a moderate republican" in the 80s. That\'s just a farcical interpretation of the past. '

Including other Democrats.  \n(every politician is a liar I don't pick sides)\nThe Reps wouldn't nominate a candidate like him if they had one either. \n\nHe'd not good for either side because he fights for the people and issues in the middle that most of us agree with.\n\nUnelectable."

aS"funny because 3/4 is how much Rand Paul parrots from neocons. also whats funny is that Sanders started politics five years before Ron Paul started, and Sanders has continued politics whereas Paul has now retired, and Paul can't weigh in much any more for political reasons because his shitstain son is trying to win the nomination. the third thing that's funny is that Ron Paul is demonized as a kook by other Republicans while they borrow his rhetoric and make a stupid tribute video to him at the last Republican national convention like he had just fucking died while Reince Priebus ignored Paul's delegates and parliamentary procedure, whereas Democrats borrow rhetoric from Sanders all the time but just don't reference him and they actually follow parliamentary procedures at their conventions. the last thing thats funny is that civil liberties is something Sanders and Paul are both concerned about, but it's libertarians who want to pretend that they are the only ones who can protect them for Americans since socialism is necessarily evil.\n\nedit: Actually sorry, the funniest thing was Ron Paul losing the Republican nomination because of billions of dollars of monied interests blocking his ability to win it despite the fact he had thousands of people show up to his rallies and vote themselves in as delegates before they had the statuses ripped away from them.  But you'll never hear Ron Paul complain against these monied interests because it's the government that is evil, not monied interests!!!!!"

All I hope to see Sanders do is drag some much needed sense into the debates early on, and maybe if we\'re really lucky drag Hilary a bit to the left.  \n \nBelieve what you choose to believe, this is my opinion.  The entire structure of the Dem\'s won\'t want Sanders in.  Hilary is a safe and easily controlled politician.

p1785
aS'I posted the following comment on /r/sandersforpresident.\n\n\nHere\'s a few reasons why he\'s likely to lose the nomination.  \n\n\n**1. Hillary Clinton has a historic lead**. This is easy enough to explain. The [RCP poll of polls](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html) Shows her leading her closest opponent (Sen.Warren) by 50%. Even in the recent polls where Warren has not been included, Sanders still trails by 50%. These leads are consistent through the early states, with the possible exception of New Hampshire, where she "only" leads by 28% (but that lead has expanded in recent polls with the exclusion of Elizabeth Warren). These are leads she never experienced against Obama in \'08. In addition, in multiple nationwide polls, she has led the field by similar margins *among all constituencies*, again in contrast with the liberal discontent that plagued her in 2008. These are steep numbers to overcome, yet they are merely one part of a large hole for Sanders.\n\n**2. Sanders isn\'t actually a Democrat**. This is one of those things that seems like it wouldn\'t matter, seeing as he caucuses with them, but it really does. As an independent, Sanders doesn\'t have the connections with the party leadership that any Senator/Governor would, let alone Hillary Clinton. I don\'t just mean the DNC and the superdelegates, by the way, I mean the network of activists from DREAMers to labor to gay rights activists and many more in between (If you want to read more about how the party ultimately decides the nominee, I\'d recommend reading the book "[The Party Decides](http://www.amazon.com/The-Party-Decides-Presidential-Nominations/dp/0226112373)". That structure has already gotten behind Clinton in a big way, which we can know through the amount of endorsements she receives, and again we see a contrast to \'08. In \'08, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer were begging Obama to run and beat Clinton. This time around, Schumer has endorsed Clinton, along with several other USA. Senators. The best way I\'ve seen is put is from Larry Sabato, Director of the UVA\'s Center for Politics, saying that Sanders [is an outsider in what is very much an insider process](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2016-president/).\n\n**3. Sanders has no national network**. Unlike O\'Malley (in \'14) and the Clintons (for the past 6 years), Sanders hasn\'t, to the best of my knowledge, been going around the country cheering on and campaigning for local/statewide/federal candidates. The Clintons have a tightly coordinated network of organizers and party leaders all over the country. Now, this might be the easiest hurdle for Sanders to overcome, but....\n\n**4. Sanders is at an enormous money disadvantage**. I\'m sure you\'ve seen that chart showing how much Hillary has raised vs how much Bernie has raised. In case you don\'t know, in 2010, the Supreme Court ~~unleashed Pandora\'s Box~~ removed the cap on independent spending by a Super PAC, in a case known as Citizens United vs FEC. This means that none of the PACs that will be "unofficially affiliated" with Hillary Clinton have to disclose donors, and they will have as much money to spend as they please. Sanders will be taking no corporate money, nor will he have a Super PAC. These are noble aims, for sure, but they put him at a severe disadvantage in a race as expensive as this. \n\n**Should you give up and not support Sanders?** **NO!** While he isn\'t likely to win, participating and getting involved will shape the debate in the Democratic primary. If Sanders does well enough, then we could see a shift in the DNC to move left as an organization and cover their left flank. That would represent a change in the elected officials from the state level to the national. Hillary isn\'t likely to be pushed left, but the party can be, and it all starts with Sanders injecting new and disaffected voters into the process.'
p1786
aS'As Bernie Sanders pointed out calling this a free trade agreement is a misnomer. It is a corporate control agreement. [See what the EFF has to say about the TPP here.](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp)\n\nAlso, saying that NAFTA didn\'t destroy manufacturing is like saying the West Nile virus killed that person, not the mosquito that bit that bit him.\n\nRepublicans know that they can get conservative\'s eyes to glass over with the words "free trade," but they have to be smart enough to see that there really is nothing free about lopsided trade deals. And, I question whether protecting mega-huge corporate interests should be conservative policy. Exactly like protecting big banks who are too big to fail really should not  conservative policy - remember how all the republicans were fawning over the idea of repealing Glass-Steagal?\n\nI really think the Republican party has become diluted and confused with a strain of libertarianism. And Democrats, your president supporting the TPP is beyond pale.'
p1787
aS'It might be a stunt, but I think it has more to do with part of his campaign for President. I don\'t think he is supposed to win, but to provide a counterpoint to Hillary Clinton. So when the Republicans trot out the standard, "Hillary Clinton is a left wing radical socialist hippy tree hugger," the Democratic party has someone to point at and say, "No, she\'s really not. Check out Bernie over here. Hillary is the \'centrist.\'" Which she isn\'t (she appears to lean further to the political right than Obama), but Sanders provides her a way to weaken the Republican rhetoric.\n\nSanders isn\'t an appeal to a subset of Democrats; his run is an appeal for Clinton to a subset of Republicans/independents. The Democratic party is moving the goal post to the left, and making Clinton look more moderate, instead of letting the conservatives move the goal post to the right, and making Clinton out to be a socialist.'
p1788
aS'I\'m not arguing with your logic, but I asked for evidence not opinion :\\\n\nIt\'s still an opinion that he doesn\'t have a chance due to all of the "evidence" you used being not much more than opinion of why he wouldn\'t win. I\'m asking for the REAL hard evidence that proves "BERNIE SANDERS CANNOT WIN" until I see that I refuse to believe that just because some of you people have an opinion of why he won\'t win, is why he won\'t win. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that idiots like you guys who go around supporting the idea that Sanders doesn\'t have a chance by using your own opinion(be it well formed logic or not), are hurting your cause by creating and promoting the idea that Sanders doesn\'t have a chance, and it does not mean that you can predict the future or know how the elections will pan out.  If you pussies stopped being so on the fence on the matter and were willing to take a risk and just fully support Sanders then maybe the election would pan out differently from how you "expect" it to go. Can\'t expect change if you don\'t pursue it yourself.\n\nSanders has more of a chance than either Hillary or Jeb Bush do, at least in my eyes, but then again I\'m not afraid of being wrong as long as I\'ve supported my beliefs until the bitter end.'

aS'&gt;The fact of the matter is that idiots like you guys\n\nWell, if you\'re gonna flat out call me and mine idiots, then we hardly need to continue this, do we? Nevertheless, I\'ll assume that it was just a poor choice of words and address your comment.\n\n\n&gt;It\'s still an opinion that he doesn\'t have a chance due to all of the "evidence" you used being not much more than opinion of why he wouldn\'t win.\n\nAn opinion that\'s grounded in trends and historical data, which is as close as you\'ll get when predicting in politics. \n\n&gt; I\'m asking for the REAL hard evidence that proves "BERNIE SANDERS CANNOT WIN" until I see that I refuse to believe that just because some of you people have an opinion of why he won\'t win, is why he won\'t win.\n\nI see. By this logic, Vermin Supreme is also a viable presidential candidate, because there\'s no REAL hard evidence that proves "VERMIN SUPREME CANNOT WIN". At some point, you have to acknowledge that data and trends have predictive value, lest you consider all of the jokers who\'ve filed with the FEC to be legitimate threats. \n\n&gt;...does not mean that you can predict the future or know how the elections will pan out.\n\nYou should read the comment. I said he\'s "likely to lose" - not "he will lose". Probabilities aren\'t definitive, and I acknowledge that. Yet I think I have put forward, through trends and historical behavior, as good of an argument as I can to support my side - an argument, I might add, that\'s more supported than...\n\n&gt; If you pussies stopped being so on the fence on the matter and were willing to take a risk and just fully support Sanders then maybe the election would pan out differently from how you "expect" it to go.\n\nWell, wait. Who said I wanted to "fully support Sanders"? I want to see who else is running. I want to give O\'Malley and Webb a chance.

aS"This is a silly argument. The more educated a populace is overall the more productive and powerful it's going to be.\n\nWhile of course we shouldn't force higher education on people, and we shouldn't lax standards to get in, we also should not *actively deter entry* for those who want it. That's the only thing a debt wall of 40k does - keeps young geniuses out there from reaching their potential.\n\nBernie Sanders understands the value of making education accessible for our next generation of scientists and inventors (and others) interested in it. The cost of higher education in the US is really fucking silly, and European democracies shit all over us in that aspect. Education should not be a privilege for the wealthy."

aS"My expectations are based on this. Sanders is a strong left-wing candidate from Vermont with little national name recognition. I believe that he has a small, dedicated following, but I think that can only go so far.\n\nBefore he can compete against a Republican, he will need to put together a 50 state campaign with the ability to raise hundreds of millions of dollars just to be somewhat competitive against Hillary. I'm not familiar with his campaign staff, but I'm guessing they don't have experience with that.\n\nNothing is impossible, but in order for Sanders to win the primary, he would need to win New Hampshire and Nevada. Hillary will likely win Iowa and South Carolina. If he managed that, then maybe he could raise money going into Super Tuesday. However he would then need the national network established and financed to win a majority of the states. And again, I don't see how he even gets that far."
p1803
aS"Referencing a *national* poll, I believe we would agree.\n\nMost people don't vote in the primaries... Especially the dems. Among the very politically active (and thereby most likely primary voters) Sanders is huge. Historically the primaries have around 30ish% turn out. If HC has the support of 57% or w/e~ &amp; say 35--50/57 are part of the 70+% that don't vote, all those polling numbers only mean HC has name recognition. Plenty of people had never even heard of Obama before he won the primaries, something to keep in mind.\n"

aS"Buried but here is my two cents: a lot of people are talking about how Sanders is grandstanding and passing a bill that he knows won't pass. Why won't it pass? Because compromise is impossible in Washington. Until there is a way to filter out old blood (perhaps a term cap for Congressmen and women) and vote in new people who can get shit done nothing will happen. Well, that's not entirely accurate. Democrats and Republicans will never not rape our infrastructure, education, Social Security, ANYTHING to get into another meaningless war against a vaguely defined enemy. I'm for this because I'm in college and I'm poor as fuck, but I'm more for getting people into office who want to **GOVERN**. Not be concentrating on getting reelected."

aS'&gt; Yet, for every $35 billion dollar jump in the military budget no one bats an eye.\n\nAre you joking? There is a ton of objection to military spending. Why does every comment about how Sanders plans to pay for this met with a \'you probably love the military!!"?'

aS' Basically Sanders is trying to get "socialist agendas" as his main platform, and I think a lot of people just don\'t understand socialism. I\'m really not familiar at all with Scandinavian economic policy, but most of those schools including European are free. I may be wrong, but I\'m pretty sure European taxes are very high because of their "socialist" programs. There is no such thing as free, because everything has a cost. Either time, labor, money, etc all go into producing anything. So Sanders can\'t make college tuition "free" he\'s trying to subsidize it. I think it\'s a step in the right direction and here\'s why. Precluding almost every crisis there is a bubble that forms and when that bubble pops is when the crisis is realized. The stock market bubble with the great depression, the housing bubble with the great recession are two great examples. Currently young people are in a position where higher education is no longer an extra bonus, it\'s become a criteria for decent paying jobs (I\'m excluding trades here). Also most young people do not have the funds required to pay out the insane costs of college tuition, and the bigger problem is that [tuition is rising.]( http://sites.psu.edu/kmkretzer/wp-content/uploads/sites/15015/2015/04/College-Tuition-Costs.jpg) Because of this nearly everyone that attends college needs help. Whether that be through grants, loans, scholarships, etc at some point they\'re education is being subsidized. The problem with the student debt bubble is that it is young people that don\'t have their day figured out let alone their life. With massive amounts of debt some people may not even desire to graduate because they do not want to incur additional costs. When debt grows there becomes a "bankruptcy point" where you can no longer keep up with payments and must default. This is bad news for the lenders. Education isn\'t a material object like real estate or stocks so I can\'t really predict what kind of effect a "student loan crash" would have but it can\'t be good. I think Sanders is introducing this legislation to avoid this kind of situation, and if he fails he can at least claim he tried. It does open up a huge realm of problems though. Such as what about those that have already defaulted/on the brink, what about those that are just getting started, or who have already finished paying? Also tuition being subsidized by the govt has issues that I believe you\'ve already stated, that it potentially becomes a moral hazard problem, because if theses institutions are assured they will  "bailed out" in a sense then they can do whatever they please. There would need to be strict govt oversight into over 100s institutions which just becomes a logistical (and Republican) nightmare. I think it\'s a good idea and step in the right direction, but there are so many known/unknown ramifications to deal with that it can become very messy and complicated. \n\n**TL;DR** it\'s good that this is being introduced because a student debt bubble may bring about another crisis, but the problem is too big to solve right away.

aS"TL;DR: Downvote me now because this will be a largely unpopular opinion. \n\nSanders loses my potential vote here. Anybody who wants to go to college, is able to go to college. Scholarships, financial aide, work studies, just a flat out job... Plenty of ways to keep your education funded by means other than even more government handouts. Raising taxes on the 1% won't pay for millions of four-year degree."
p1815
aS'&gt; But Social Security is already redistributionary. It\'s not a repayment, although it\'s designed to look like it a little bit. You get more out of it per dollar you put in if you\'re low income than if you\'re high income. And you always have since its inception.\n\n"Marginal utility at lower incomes is higher than at higher incomes" is not the same thing as "we increased the amount people pay in, but didn\'t increase the amount they got out."\n\nI\'ll put it in numbers to help you out.\n\nRight now if you make $108,000 you pay the maximum possible payroll taxes, and will get back roughly $2,500 per month when you retire.  You get about 1.5x as much as someone who made $50,000.  Which means that while the additional money didn\'t scale 1:1, it still scaled.\n\nUnder Sanders\' plan, someone making $200,000 pays in twice as much as someone making $100,000 but gets *zero* additional benefit.\n\nAlternatively, they do get 1.5x as much, and the entire plan is a short-term benefit to social security and an even bigger long-term problem.\n\n&gt;And that\'s not to mention the disabled and widows who get Social Security and might have paid nothing or nearly nothing into it...it is Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) after all.\n\nIgnoring the "D" part of it (which is still relatively few people, and is 100% understood as welfare), survivor benefits is simply that the repayment goes to your heirs, which is the same as any other property interest.\n\n&gt;Do you also think it\'s fundamentally unfair that higher income earners experience higher tax brackets?\n\nNo, because it\'s well-understood that we have a redistributive tax system.  And because the wealthy (arguably) do enjoy greater benefits from what our taxes pay for at least in some ways.\n\nNice straw-man, though "since it\'d be silly to make this argument about income taxes, it\'s silly to argue this about social security."  Oy.\n\n&gt; "free trade" deals that do more to give freebees to corporate IP holders than they do to reduce tariffs \n\nYou should probably have some kind of citation for this.\n\n&gt;(even Krugman, who loves free trade, is against the TPP deal)\n\nWhich is a valid argument about a *specific* trade deal.  Sanders\' opposition seems to be to any trade deal which might risk U.S jobs (all of them) even if that deal on the whole will benefit the U.S economy.  No serious economist is against free trade in and of itself, but Sanders manages to talk about it like Smoot-Hawley was the best legislation in history.\n\n&gt;and slashing Pell Grants (I presume? What other federal money gets thrown at covering college costs for kids?), then why vote Democrat?\n\nYou mean the billions of dollars in loans the government gives out at below-market interest rates?  With no oversight as to the actual costs incurred by the college, or the validity of the tuition rates, much less any kind of oversight in to whether spending $50,000 on a kid studying philosophy with a minor in French is going to yield a positive ROI?\n\n[Or do you mean Sanders\' plan to simply have the government pay for college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36a2to/bernie_sanders_to_introduce_bill_to_make_college/)\n\nI\'ll link you to some numbers, [they\'re interesting](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2gat21/student_loan_debt_is_exploding_it_has_grown_so/ckhi8oh?context=3)\n\nBut you asked "why vote Democrat?"\n\nIn part because there actually isn\'t a party right now that\'s pro-choice, pro-gay rights, pro-trade, anti-"just give money to colleges", and isn\'t making ridiculously stupid arguments about the minimum wage.\n\nSo I go with the group that more closely mirrors my beliefs, and hope to change it.\n\nWhich is *exactly* what every Sanders supporter in the Democratic party is doing.\n\n&gt;PS: Sorry I assumed you were right wing. Your username sounds like it could be Joseph McCarthy\'s handle...\n\nIt\'s always sad to me when people haven\'t seen the Muppet Show.'
p1816
aS"Community college would be a much smarter approach, but Sanders is trying to pull the part to the left so that his talking points will be heard. He's not playing spoiler, and I don't think he's doing this because he expects to win. He simply wants these points to be heard.  If/when they become popular, more people will run on these promises. That's how it works, unfortunately.\n\nIt also makes Republicans vote against it, causing them to be on record against a policy that would largely benefit a great number of Americans. He can't win, but he can certainly ensure that Hilary does."
p1817
aS"But should it be?\n\nThese fuckos were elected to handle these very problems. They should be producing tight budgets and putting together programs to not only make businesses excel but the entire populace. The only thing that really complicates it is they act like petulant children and refuse to compromise and work with each other.\n\nI've voted Republican the last 3 elections and Sanders is refreshing. I don't give a shit the labels put on him. I'm sick of the Republican nonsense at this point and Sanders has my vote if he makes it through the Democratic primary. If he doesn't, I'm just voting for the best of the worst."
p1818
aS'I literally stood up and cheered for this. Sanders has to be one of the greatest candidates in a century.\n\n\nHere\'s my perspective. Will Bernie Sanders win the election? Absolutely not. Everybody knows that, even he knows it himself. But that doesn\'t mean he can\'t share his ideas, his perspectives, his views points and what he strives to change in the nation with the rest of us. I think his greatest goal right now is to win the support of enough citizens (primarily Democrats) to scare Clinton and steer her in his direction, and by doing which, squeezing some of his ideas and policies in with the compromises she makes for the public. \n\n\n\nI love how he is taking inspiration from the Eastern European countries that have always held their own subtle bragging rights over us. I believe that because many of them have never been in complete "leadership" of the world positions but are still entirely developed and self sufficient as countries, that they were able to shift to the peaceful positions where they stand, and focus on correcting their economy and educational system. Ending the nonsense wars isn\'t going to make changes, but pulling ourselves out of them will. So what if another jihadist blows up an Iranian school? I hate to sound insensitive, but that should only effect the people it directly effects, the state of Iran. Just an example, but to me it seems perfectly logical. We need to back the hell off and stop trying to be the Global Police. I mean, people wonder why these extremists in other countries hate and target us the most, it\'s because we stick our noses in business that doesn\'t concern us when we have issues of our own to attend to.\n\n\nThe greatest overall problem with the government today (in my eyes) however, is the corruption that people are not widely accused of - religious bias. If you base ANY decisions you make politically off your beliefs, that should be morally wrong and unAmerican. Sadly it\'s nearly the opposite with all these hard-headed old white Republicans shutting down the freedoms our country should have been guaranteed to, such as gay marriage and stopping the forced mention of God in national anthems and pledges. The latter being less important, but still quite an issue overall. Then everything from there gets back into economics and overseas actions, but that is a whole new ball game.'

People graduate with worthless degrees into fields with incalculable unemployment.\n\nSanders wants to make problems different. On one hand, good students will be diluted and the standard of education will fall further. Students with degrees in demanded fields will make even more money, but there will be even more people with useless degrees, either because of their area of study or their lack of studying and subsequence 2.0-3.0 GPA.  They will further dilute the marketplace for these low-demand areas and unemployment will skyrocket.\n\nI can't see this ending well, but fortunately, there is zero chance of this happening."

aS'In the article (and in so many comments) there is the refrain that we should do it like these other countries.

"They understand how important it is to be investing in their youth.  We should be doing the same."\n\nEvery single one of the countries that people (including Sanders) hold up offer higher education selectively.  I am still trying to find a large country that offers a GOOD free higher education for anyone who steps up to the plate.  \n\nMaybe we can find a way to make it free and still be as inclusive as the US system is.  However all I ever read is we should just make it like Europe.  Well if that is the case, 60% ( US = 70% of HS attend college vs 28% of German students attending gymnasium and being entitled to free university, .28/.7= .4) of the past, present and future college students in the US would not qualify under this model.  Part of the reason that the US has become what it is can be attributed to a lack of a rigid selectivity process for college and just about anyone with the desire can find a way to go. \n\nSo are we trying to model it after Europe ( and eliminate over half of the students that attend college) or are we not going to model it after Europe - in which case I want to see the plan. \n\nEdit for grammar'

The term " American exceptionalism" is rooted in the fact american workers did not take to socialism.  Reddit may love socialism, but large swaths of America doesn\'t as it goes against the capitalist nature of our country. It\'s ok not be a part of the Bernie Sanders circle jerk on reddit. It\'s ok to have views that aren\'t so leftist that you would get down voted for saying obama is too liberal. If tolerance was really a left wing virtue, why doesn\'t it tolerate dissent from the mass line?\nEdit: Bernie not Barry autocorrect.  The way reddit acts as if someone dares to have a non-hyper liberal political stance is what I\'m calling out here. There\'s a difference between respectful debate and hurling insults and -isms to deride an opposing political view. Tolerating debate is the key to ending the hyper partisan nonsense we have to today, not tolerating PC gone amok to the point it stifles debate would do america much more good.

aS'Sanders isn\'t a democratic socialist unless he pushes for worker ownership of the means of production which means his advocacy of Scandinavian-style social democracy (aka welfare capitalism) makes him a social democrat.\n\n[*Yochaigal*](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36d40l/a_democratic_socialist_campaign_its_about_time/crdgtdh) responds with an excellent point on Sanders\' support of cooperatives. See one link regarding Bernie [on worker ownership](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-unveils-employee-ownership-legislation) and the relevant quote from the other link here:\n\n*Sanders*: "We need to develop new economic models to increase job creation and productivity. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations which ship our jobs to China and other low-wage countries, we need to provide **assistance to workers who want to purchase their own businesses by establishing worker-owned cooperatives**. Study after study shows that when workers have an ownership stake in the businesses they work for, productivity goes up, absenteeism goes down and employees are much more satisfied with their jobs."\n\n*Me*: As I understand it, capital circulation requires all three processesmoney, productive, and commodity capitalsbecause they co-determine one another and form a feedback loop of sorts. In the face of a hostile credit and merchant capital system, this is why worker control in relatively isolated production units rarely survives. The most famous exception to this is [*Mondragon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) because they also created their own credit structures and merchant capital outlets *in addition* to their productive assets. I\'m sure a lot of this is familiar since you\'re part of a cooperative. I\'m uploading [this book review](http://ge.tt/3MtkbeG2/v/0) of *Values at Work: Employee Participation Meets Market Pressures at Mondragon* which explains further.\n\n[*Yochaigal*](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36d40l/a_democratic_socialist_campaign_its_about_time/crdmwzl): What you\'re saying here is very true. However, as a founder of two worker cooperatives (shoutout to /r/cooperatives) I will add this: although financial and legal status is still a major issue, every year there are more of us. That means more economic connections - and more capital to work with. For example, in my state (MA) the pioneer valley is full of so many successful co-ops that their co-op-run trade union (VAWC) has created a revolving loan fund for developing more worker co-ops.\n\nThere are plenty of other examples I could give, but I\'m on phone at the moment and tapping is hard.\n'

How about a livable wage? Breaking up the big banks? Campaign finance reform? A path to citizenship? There\'s plenty the DNC stands for and it\'s a far cry from just saying we\'re "not those guys" '

The reason he's being painted as a curiosity with no real chance of winning is because the data we have so far shows he has no chance of winning.\n\nIt does get a little closer when you look at the latest [Iowa polling](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/ia/ia05072015_Igrwf25.pdf), because he's behind by 45 but behind by 45 points is not THAT much more interesting."

p1860
aS'I just spent 15 minutes writing a response on my phone, which then crashed and lost the whole thing.\n\n\nI think I included everything in the rewrite.\n\n...\n\n&gt;That\'s what I was saying, that people who say that it\'s pretty much a 50/50 between Bernie and Hillary are dead wrong, but also that people who think that if Bernie were to win the primary that that would spell certain victory for the GOP are also wrong.  \n\nI fully believe that Bernie would do just fine against whatever Republican they decide to field. I\'m not at all concerned that he wouldn\'t be capable as the Democratic nominee.\n\nHowever he will not be allowed to be the Democratic nominee.\n\nSanders has the unfortunate history of voting and acting based on his principles.  He is the type that as president would act in the best interest of the people as best he could, regardless of the effect on others in power.\n\nThat is not something that can be allowed near the White House.\n\nIf he was to get into the White House, he would quickly have his hands tied.  But even then he would have the potential to draw attention to a variety of issues. For example he is exactly the type that would push for changes to our stupid first past the post voting system.  There is no way they would allow him to change it, but he could draw a great deal of attention to it.  That is not something that either the Republicans or Democrats want to see happen.\n\nAnd mind you I don\'t want this to sound like some conspiracy nut saying that there is a group of Illuminati masterminds behind the Republicans and Democrats, but what I mean is that every one of those Republicans and Democrats will vote in their best interest. And their best interests is to maintain the status quo.\n\n&gt;But maybe you wouldn\'t actually disagree with that since you were talking about strategic voting in the general, which, speaking just for myself, I certainly intend to vote for whoever the democratic nominee is, mostly for judicial nominations and because none of the GOP candidates will likely do anything positive on the issue of climate change.\n\nAgreed, and a host of other issues similar to that.  The Supreme Court is a long term impact on the decisions that we make for president.\n\n&gt;Though I would disagree that it\'s a virtual impossibility for Bernie to win the primary.  As best as anyone can tell right now his chances are slim, but that small chance of him winning is dependant on people, maybe like yourself, who would prefer to see him win over Hillary, and who decide to put in work for the campaign, talk about him with friends/family/co-workers, and donate whatever they can, instead of giving in to the idea that he can\'t win and should therefore receive no tangible support from people who in fact think he is the best candidate.\n\nIf sheer determination and tenacity of the supporters were enough to put a person into office, we would currently be enjoying our third term with ron paul as president.\n\n&gt;His slim chances aren\'t solely based on name recognition and assumed inevitability, a certain level of apathy by those who may actually support him is assumed as well, and he will lose if his supporters don\'t put in the work for him to win.  Basically, as he himself said, something of a political revolution is needed for him to win, which I think sounds more daunting than is actually the case.\n\nThe only way that we\'re going to see a political revolution is if we have a way to make our actual voices heard. This "all or nothing" system of government is largely to blame.  Nearly every presidential election that I have taken part in has ended with me having to vote for the lesser evil. With the exception of the 2000 election, I have always voted Democrat. And that is unfortunate.  The person I vote for should be something that requires a bit of thought. It should require me to listen to several people stances and opinions on issues, as well as their recommendations to solve problems, and then voting for who I feel would do best in the position.\n\nCurrently though? I vote for the person who I feel will do the least harm.  My views aren\'t necessarily being represented, but when my choices come down to one party who I feel is taking a half ass approach to health care, and another party who wants to round up homosexuals in camps, I vote for the lesser evil.'

aS'I think that traditional media paints Bernie as a curiosity with no real chance of winning because Bernie is a curiosity with no real chance of winning.\n\nSanders is not a contender for the same reason that Ted Cruz is not a contenderwhile each can garner fervent support from a small minority of the electorate, Americans as a whole tend to avoid candidates on either extreme of the political spectrum.'
p1862
aS'&gt; He doesn\'t back down from questions. He stands up for what he believes in.\n\nThese are the things that matter most to me, and I\'m hoping they\'ll be the things that people notice when the debates begin.  He answers questions by telling you what he *will do*, not what his opponents *won\'t do*.  He tries to give examples of the problems he feels we face, to better frame and ground his positions.  It\'s very refreshing to see, especially considering our current political climate, where candidates can get away with telling you almost next to nothing about themselves, by diverting your attentions to the inadequacy of their counterparts.\n\nI\'m not stupid enough to believe that he\'ll be able to continue this indefinitely.  Being a good politician means being able to show, not only why you are the right candidate, but why your opponent is the wrong candidate.  Unfortunately, that usually means some form of negative advertising or campaigning.  But, like I said, it\'s refreshing to see a candidate who\'s early focus is on really making sure that the people know who he is, what he\'s about, where he sees problems, and how he wants to fix them.\n\nIn 2008, Obama talked about "Hope and Change."  In 2015, Bernie Sanders makes me feel like there\'s hope *for* change.'

p1871
aS"Hillary is pretty conservative though, and if she was running as a republican would probably have a great run and maybe a win.\n\nDifferent this time around is having somebody who is actually left of center rather than the moderate only-slightly-right Obama.\n\nDespite the circlejerk here about 'lazy voters' and how right-wing, conservative democrats are entitled to the liberal vote; they aren't entitled to those votes. Lots of 'liberal' voters are just apathetic and don't vote... for candidates who refuse to represent their interests. Despite the political strategy of lesser of two evils, many people simply don't vote at all when it comes to a choice of ass-tearing sodomy or shit-in-the-mouth. You might think the choice is clear and eagerly line up to cast your vote for such, but a ton of apathy and 'laziness' does indeed come from having 2 terrible choices.\n\nSanders is more than just an old white man, he also represents a very rare chance for moderate to left liberals to actually have somebody worth voting for. Hillary was and is courting the left as a 'I'm not going to represent you, but who else are you going to vote for?' voting block. She's clearly taking the liberal vote for granted, which is one the greatest flaws in the democratic party. Having locked down the lesser of two evils votes from the left, she could safely swing right... but Sanders changes all that. Competition for votes from the left could realistically force ex-republican and conservate democrat Hillary Clinton toward the left.\n\nWhen was the last time the Overton Window was being pushed leftwards? If Clinton doesnt play it right, the vagina vote might not be enough."

p1877
aS"Sanders is awesome and all, but is there anything to show that he's President material?\n\nWords are nice, but realistically, its going to take a lot more than words for all of this to get done. Does Sanders have the experience and/or connections to actually get Congress to agree, or are we going to be left with more government shutdowns with an even more stubborn congress?"
p1878
aS'Serious answer: Sanders has a very long history in government and his record is basically unblemished. Take a look at his track record. He\'s vocal and unabashed about his viewpoints on certain things. It seems, now, that those "certain things" are the things that are really pissing Americans off. Sanders seems like a possible alternative from our current circlejerk of "don\'t talk about important issues" that the dems and republicans have both played (with the exception of Ron Paul) for the past few decades.'
p1879
aS'&gt; Different this time around is having somebody who is actually left of center rather than the moderate only-slightly-right Obama.\n\nExcept I would say the majority of leftist liberal Democrats thought Obama was one of them in the first election (and to a lesser extent in the second)... the whole "hope and change" thing. I still remember reading how Obama was going to be a major shift to the left. But really, he didn\'t stimulate all that much "hidden" progressive vote, mostly because I don\'t think there is very much hidden leftist vote, despite what you see here on /r/politics, which is far outside the mainstream American electorate. Obama got slightly more youth vote than normal, though.\n\n&gt; Having locked down the lesser of two evils votes from the left, she could safely swing right... but Sanders changes all that.\n\nI think you\'re vastly overestimating how many Democrats are going to be excited about Sanders. Most Democrats are moderate. While I think some *do* want someone more left than Hillary, Sanders is so far out there that I think they will be scared off. He\'s literally the farthest left in all of American politics. They\'ll be scared not only because Sanders doesn\'t represent what they want, but also because Sanders wouldn\'t have a chance in hell against any Republican. So even if someone likes Sanders, some won\'t vote for him out of "anyone but a Republican" sentiment.\n\nI will be shocked if Sanders gets more than 25-30% of a significant state primary vote. It\'s not impossible, but I\'ll just be shocked (and I\'m tempted to say 15-20%).'
p1880
aS'The same thing was said about Obama being black. The question at the time was would America vote for a black man over a white woman. Now the question will be, will America vote for a Jewish man over a white woman. We are still trying to figure out if we are more racist or sexist.\n\nTo be fair Sanders has WAY less backing then Obama did. Clinton is the clear favorite right now. Things can still change this early thought. '

aS'Well it depends on your definition of "better" and "best." \n\nPersonally I think he\'s fucking awesome. \n\nHere\'s the [12 initiatives](https://berniesanders.com/issues/) from his website:\n\n* **Infrastructure**: ASCE ranked US as D+ on condition of infrastructure. Plan: Invest &gt;$1tn over 5 years in public works projects to revamp our national infrastructure and generate 13 million jobs. If ASCE estimates that if we don\'t make this improvements by 2020, the US will have lost $3.1tn in GDP and 3.5m jobs.\n\n* **Climate Change**: Carbon credits, fund research (vague still!)\n\n* **Tax Reform**: Has previously heavily advocated (and voted for) an aggressively graduated tax schedule which lowers the burden for lower/middle class Americans, closes corporate and high income loopholes. (Vague)\n\n* **Social Safety Net**: Strengthening social safety net including SS, Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition programs\n\n* **Universal Healthcare**: Single payer system (vague, but look at his record)\n\n* **Financial Regulation**: Instead of allowing institutions to grow so large they must be bailed out, regulate Wall St to emphasize its actual utilities: primarily to facilitate flow of capital and maintain liquidity. Sanders proposes to break up large financial institutions into smaller independent organizations which cannot collude to drive profits.\n\n* **Education**: Make some base standard of higher education free.\n\n* **Trade Policy**: Stop creating policies (NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR) that make it profitable to move jobs overseas. Remove America from the "race to the bottom" which China can undoubtedly win.\n\n* **Female Pay Inequality**: Simple, just guarantee equal pay for equal work. Unsure on specifics of implementation here.\n\n* **Higher Minimum Wage**: Raise national minimum wage to $15/hr over the next few years, guarantee no one working 40hrs/week lives in poverty.\n\n* **Strengthen Trade Unions**: Prevent corporations from discouraging/weakening unions which are desired by majorities of their employees.\n\n* **Worker Co-ops**: Instead of providing tax breaks to corporations, provide tax breaks to individuals who choose to purchase portions of their employer-company, thus incentivizing the creation of worker-owned cooperative companies.\n'

aS'Just saw this in another article, where Sanders was quoted as saying:\n\n&gt;"We live in a highly competitive global economy and, if our economy is to be strong, we need the best-educated work force in the world....That will not happen if, every year, hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college, and if millions more leave school deeply in debt....We used to lead the world in the percentage of our people who graduated college. Today we are in 12th place. We used to have great universities tuition free. Today they are unaffordable. I want a more educated work force."\n\nCompletely valid, informed, and logical argument.

aS'I used to like Hillary. I still do somewhat, but she\'s .... compromised. I think she has spent the last several years lining up big money donors and negotiating her candidacy with them. This strategy might have worked in the past when all media was controlled by billionaires and multi-national corporations, but social media and the internet have evolved to fill the void for speaking truth to power. \n\nI believe the biggest problem this nation has is the inequality explained in Robert Reich\'s movie, "Inequality for All" (and everything that led to it, like Citizens United and the campaign financing\'s corruption of government). Hillary has correctly latched onto the inequality issue as her campaign\'s linchpin, but her ties to Big Ag are in direct contradiction to her trumpeted (but vague) position on the inequality issue. How can she claim to be "for the middle class" when 90% of citizens want GMO labeling, and Hillary\'s pro-GMO and getting very large donations from Big Ag?!\n\nIowa saw through her, and has now coined the phrase, "Bride of Frankenfood". I really think the name\'s going to stick because it\'s so perfect. I thought being pro-GMO was only a vote deal-breaker for me. I hardly know anyone complaining about GMOs like me. I hate that Iowa and NH are the only states getting all the candidates\' attention. I\'m so glad Iowans have seen through the charade and are holding Hillary accountable, and Bernie Sanders is getting traction because of it. I\'ve been asking (ok hounding) Hillary\'s Facebook page to post Hillary\'s positions on the issues. I know, a basic expectation, right? They flat out REFUSE! They insist that her "silence" on the issues is "ok" and tell me to "google her". It\'s arrogant of Hillary to assume she can ask for support, volunteers and votes without even stating her positions on the issues!\n\nCould this catapult Bernie Sanders to the top of the polls for the democratic nomination?\n\n'

aS'There\'s a pretty big difference between saying "Bernie Sanders\' campaign for Democratic nomination in 2016 may be prophetic" and saying "Bernie Sanders is a prophet".\n\nNobody is claiming that he can predict the future, which would be, as you said, literally calling him a prophet. '

aS'Oh I\'m definitely fine with supporting his campaign, and I don\'t have a bad word to say to anyone who is taking time to get the word out.  \n\nThe only point where I begin to have a problem is when people seem to lose sight of the actual probabilities.  The groups who are so far into it that they would never vote for Hillary, but would happily vote for Sanders.\n\nIt\'s that loss of sight of the importance of strategic voting which worries me more than anything. It\'s the jaded frustration at constantly having to vote for the lesser evil.\n\nI support Sanders right up until the moment where he is costing votes which would have gone to the Democratic nominee, whoever that may be.  Likewise if by some act of God Sanders did get the nomination (and all of the flying pigs did not bring it into society), I would be livid at Hillary if she was to take any action which drew votes away from Sanders.\n\nI guess the extreme TL:DR is "yay Sanders, but let\'s not get our collective panties in a twist when Hillary is the Democratic nominee."'

That's what built the country. Not socialism.

I can guarantee you neither natural resources nor ocean access make a country economically great. The economic developmentalist path Sanders wants America to take has been the Brazilian path for a century. The results? If you have a family income of $100 dollars a month you're officially considered as part of the middle class by our (socialist) government ([source](http://bit.ly/1c1xeZu)).\n\nFree market economy, low government intervention, entrepreneurial spirit and your constitutionally guaranteed essential freedoms is what turned America into the land of opportunity.\n\nUnfortunately it also created generations of spoiled brats with their heads stuck so deep up their behinds they think socialism is the answer.\n\n**I'm not sure why, but while the answer appears to me, it does not appear when other users browse.

That doesn't sound quite right to me. There's some serious wrong-doings going on; ranging from the borderline bribery/blackmail to the tax system-- and even that doesn't even begin to cover it all. Politicians and billionaires are unlikely to just sit quiet and still if someone begins stripping away their money and power. Is Sanders going to bring us more than more government shutdowns, inaction, and political divides? Even if we do make progress, how long is it for? 2 years? 4? 8? Will congress just reverse the good done?\n\nAt this point in time, someone who can make progress may work as a better President than one who commits to their ideology.

aS"A typical trade is around $10. High-income traders move hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars at a time. The volume of trades executed by high-income by the top 1% of income earners is enormous relative to the number of trades executed. If you exempted low- and middle-income earners from the tax, the tax revenue would become absolutely negligible. Not even remotely close to covering the cost of universally subsidized higher education.\n\nIt sounds like what you might support is a higher capital gains tax in exchange for subsidizing college. But even that's a false dichotomy - there is tax revenue and tax expenditure and no feasible way to force Representatives to meaningfully relate the two. In truth trying to relate the two is a political tactic. The discussion around what we should subsidize or tax should be a question of economic externalities, and the discussion around what we should spend tax revenue should is a question of what goods produce greater utility when provided by the public rather than private sector (health care, education, utilities.) Economics, not politics, is at the heart of public finance.  \n\nIf you want subsidized college, and I agree it's a valid goal, then argue to make that a spending priority. There's no need to disincentivize investment behavior, there's plenty of room in the budget. Our democratic representatives just don't agree that it's a priority.\n\nSanders knows this, he is pandering to those who don't understand these distinctions, and it's a poor strategy, because there aren't enough voters like you and I who agree that subsidizing college education is a priority, and many of those who do agree also understand that it's a terrible idea to implement a flat tax on trading."

aS'&gt; No, this isn\'t a bad proposal. EU is implementing a tax on financial trading...\n\nYou\'re way off the mark. EUFTT is hardly comparable to the Sander\'s proposal. Two major distinctions that spring to mind are: first, the size of the levy - the EU is talking about a tax that would be more like 0.01-0.1% - Sanders proposes 0.5%, a substantial difference; and second, the scope of application - the EU is aiming to explicitly target financial institutions - Sanders wants to tax "every $100.00 of stock trades" ... whatever that applies to.\n\n&gt; The only thing this tax would TRULY hurt is HFT\'s...\n\nThat\'s not even certain. HFT profits come from trading enormous volumes for small gross margins. HFT exists because there\'s huge demand for tight spreads in markets and that need is not going away soon. HFT models will adjust to transaction taxes and still race the markets.\n\n&gt; Companies are freely trading trillions upon trillions of dollars, for basically free (tiny tiny administrative tax).\n\nAt the very best, this is a justification for transaction taxes that pay for market security and enforcement of anti-fraud and securities laws. Education funding couldn\'t be further from the activity of financial transactions.\n\n&gt; Tons of investors will actually play markets in other countries to completely avoid capital gains taxes.\n\n... and financial transaction taxes create a new incentive to do just that. It gives way to a race to the bottom where transactions will race to more obscure, less transparent and regulated, lower tax national markets.\n\n&gt; We have kids who can\'t afford college We have school districts cutting funding to Arts, Music, Sports We have school districts closing early due to no funding\n\nStudent loan debt should be forgiven, the United States should have single-payer higher education, federal income taxes should be raised on high earners, wealth and estate taxes should be implemented, there are ten thousand better ways to address the unfairness of education in America.\n\nI support increased education funding, I don\'t support linking it to transaction taxes. FTT reliant education funding would rise and fall based on the volume of exchange transactions. Education supporters would find ourselves rooting for volatile, chopping markets with lots of transactions to keep the gravy rolling in. When the business cycle peaks and economies enter recession values and volumes will plummet which would make education funding even more cyclically-aligned, thriving in boom times and thirsting in all others.\n\nEducation is an easy target for cuts because of complex political factors. If FTT is a huge success, its revenues will almost certainly be plundered by future politicians for the sake of more powerful interests than teachers and middle class families.\n\nAmerica needs education funding that is reliable, not paid for by stock trades. You say you don\'t cry for the Wall Street wankers that oppose taxes, so you go to the same wankers with your hand out to pay for your kid\'s music teacher? Think about it more broadly. Don\'t be a muppet.'

aS'The stock market wasn\'t "developed" by government to create a public platform to allow businesses to raise capital.\n\nIt\'s a natural consequence of ownership and wanting to have money in the form of confidence in a business plan.\n\nThat high frequency traders tell a computer to recognize market dictated patterns of price doesn\'t change things.\n\nThis is like how certain liberals freak the fuck out about GMO foods *when literally anything they eat is a \'GMO\'* because it\'s a human grown cultivar and not a wildtype plant (which still has selective pressures)\n\nSure.\n\nan HFT algorithm determined set of calls isn\'t exactly like a guy saying "Gee willickers, those guys at General Robotics sure have made inspiring investments in labor and machine improvements, I hope I can buy their shares at this price, I expect them to rise in absolute value as a firm!", but it also isn\'t magic.\n\nTake away the HFT, and you take away a massive chunk of the money that becomes available as capital to firms and securities and basic commodities being bought and sold.\n\nWhy is aggregate action to be profited on bad when the evaluation is done precisely by a computer in miliseconds from raw numerical *obviously related to actual future profitability* type data, but good when it\'s done by millions of humans over a fiscal quarter on the basis of whatever the hell they collectively came to decide from whatever beliefs?  \n\nI mean, come on.\n\n\n**all this is, is populism from Bernie Sanders knowing he can say "Free College/No student debt" and "Fuck wallstreet" to get votes, and betting that he can put them in the same sentence for even more**'

aS"That's not a good argument. Nobody should go all in all the time, and there are many tools available to measure your specific risk tolerance at a given point in time. It's best to reevaluate your investments at least yearly to reallocate funds appropriately. Yes, bonds, annuities, and other measures are nice, but the big growth that I desire comes from my 401k and vanguard index funds. I shouldn't have to lose money to help out someone that wants a free ride. The problem is, these kids that want free rides are the ones that will end up paying hard as well down the road. You have to look fifty years in the future with these kinds of decisions. Sanders is just attempting to win the youth over, as democrats often do. \n\nPerhaps you aren't like the hive mind I read of on here, but I often read people complaining that their parents and grandparents had pensions that we no longer get. 401k's have become our pensions. Don't ruin our retirement to educate others in degrees that may or may not translate into real world success. Just as I have taken risk to invest my money in everything from my house to school to retirement, others should as well. It leads to a more efficient outcome. "

aS'&gt;Why is it bad policy to tax things that are detrimental or produce nothing? I, single-handedly provide more value to society with my personal labor than all of the HFT activities that have ever been or ever will be.\n\nFirst, saying HFT doesn\'t produce anything is essentially saying bartering produce nothing. I also don\'t know who would be arrogant enough to say that he/she alone would provide more value to the society than a modernized, digitized bartering system.\n\n&gt;Why am I taxed so much higher?\n\nUnless you\'re taxed above 35%, you\'re not. HFT is considered short term trading, and any of its realized profit will be taxed at 35%. What Sanders is proposing is essentially a "pay as you go" tax, in which any and all transaction above $100 will be taxed.\n\nI hope I don\'t have to explain to you why that is one of the most idiotic ideas I\'ve ever heard coming from someone who\'s supposedly "educated".'
p1957
aS"I wouldn't call it insane, but I don't think it's good either. I make a modest middle class income and I trade stocks. I buy and sell roughly $1K at a time, so I'm handing Sanders $5 per transaction to pay for these kids who can't get scholarships or FAFSA funding to go to university. It doesn't seem like much sure, but I'm losing probably a thousand dollars to that over the course of a year. Not only that but every penny I lose to fees means the stock I just bought needs to get higher for me to make a reasonable return.\n\nI'm only willing to accept this kind of cost if they actually have academic standards and only certain free degrees, and I don't see Sanders saying that. "

aS"Populists have vague ideas not specific plans, that's the nature of populism. Most people have no idea what the specific way of doing things should be, but they like general platitudes.\n\nUntil Bernie Sanders starts talking about how he'll make things happen verse what he wants to happen, then I'll take him more seriously. Right now he's no different than Obama making promises he can't keep."
p1959
aS"&gt;Maybe you're not a very good communicator then.\n\nOr maybe because you only focus on one aspect of the issue? Even ignoring the practicality of such tax in the real world, the proposal will never get passed. This is similar to the GOP's repeated attempts to repeal Obamacare, despite how fruitless and hopeless it has proven to be. Sanders knows that very well. How is this different from Ted Cruz making outrageous claim to get more donations?\n\nSecondly, I don't understand why the tax will be funding college educations. Currently the high price stems from overabundance of demand for college education. Making it cheaper will increase the demand, thus increasing the price of education. Essentially you just took money from a group of people to give to another group of people, when neither of them really need it.\n\n&gt;Again, WHY IS IT BAD POLICY TO TAX SOMETHING THAT IS DETRIMENTAL OR PROVIDES NO VALUE? Answer = it's not!\n\nHere's the simple answer: because it does provide value, contrary to your entrenched yet uneducated opinion."

I would be giving Sanders $5 every time I do this which doesn't sound like much, but it equals up to at least a thousand per year. Not only does losing a thousand dollars per year mess up the timeline for my retirement (I consistently get a 15-30% return each year, so yes I can predict a timeline), but it means my stocks have to go even higher for me to make a reasonable return.\n\nSanders hasn't wrecked me, but he will have certainly hurt me a great deal.

Some of the people that do the best in college are poor, and they have guaranteed loans. I think that's as far as our system needs to go.\n\nGoing back to the original topic, though, it's actually funny that Bernie Sanders is a senator for Vermont and you would think with this terrific idea he has, he's put some pressure within his own state to change things for the better - but Vermont is the second most expensive state in terms of college tuition costs. Yes, I know he can't do much as a senator but he used to be the mayor of their largest city and if he cares about this issue so much he could have at least set a good example by trying to push for affordable higher education in his own state first."

aS"&gt;Thats...exactly what he's proposing.\n\nNo it's not. He is propsing a tax of roughly 50 cents on every 100 dollars traded. It's equal to a half a percent tax. Say Joe makes 1 trade, and it's value is 100 dollars, Joe pays 50 cents. Now let's say Bob is an HFT and makes 1000 trades worth 100 dollars, he pays... 50 cents. So it's not a fee for every trade, it's a fee on the amount traded. To reduce HFT, you need to put a fee to every trade. You need to have it like, say Joe makes that 1 trade worth 100, he pays 50 cents, if bob pays say half a cent per trade, that will mean Bob pays 5 dollars in fees rather than 50 cents. \n\n&gt;HFT is already less profitable per trade than it was. More competition. Many of the large HFT firms have spread to markets accross the world trying to capture some of that old magic.\n\nIt's still pretty damn lucrative, and should be stopped in my opinion, and putting a fee to every transaction could go a long way to slowing it down a lot more than this could, and could actually stop it. \n\n&gt;If you put a small fee on trades in the US markets that would be a huge blow, mainly, to HFT firms that are currently still (despite lower profits) scraping billions from our capital markets every year.\n\nYou can keep lowering profits, and still keep them doing what they do, once you turn it into losses, or barely breaking even, then it will stop. What Sanders proposed would lower the profits some, but not by a lot, and almost certainly not enough to stop it. \n\n\n"

aS"I'm not a Sanders supporter, but I like civil discussions where we both try to educate each other.\n\n&gt; 3) Find why college is so expensive and reduce that cost.\n\nThere are many people who think that college is expensive because of exactly what Sanders is proposing. College tuition has been increasing much faster than inflation ever since the federal government started paying for people's education and subsidizing their student loans. Most people can attend any college they get into because of those loans and grants, so colleges have stopped trying to make their tuition rates competitive. There is even a college near me that significantly increased their tuition (without changing their services) because it made them look more selective and elite.\n\nIn summary, taxing the investors of America (whose capital funds the economy) to pay for tuition has the potential to make the investors poorer, the universities richer, and the students just as poor, but more dependent on the government than they started.\n\nPlease feel free to correct my mistakes.\n"

Think of it like a Sin Tax. You want your cigarettes and lottery scratchers, you're going to get taxed, son.  \n\nAnd as far as moving everything to London, well that's easy to fix: the transaction tax on stock trades has to be paid on any trade initiated or funded in any way by a Us citizen or corporation who does business in the US, just like foreign income earned by a Us citizen working abroad is taxed. \n\nQuite honestly, we need to come up with about $18 trillion for our debt, and another 20 or 30 trillion for our social programs, quick...and that's not even touching on the infrastructure issues we have, also in the trillions. \n\nIt has to come from somewhere, and there is a giant pool of cash worth about that just sitting out there. Either a socialist or a liberal is going to take it, and heck, to be honest I wouldn't put such actions past anyone currently in the GOP field either. \n\nWhen you have 90 million people out of work, and more than 50% of the nation on food stamps because they can't afford to eat GOOD FUCKING LUCK getting them to feel even a split-second of sorry about your mutual funds or 6 to 7 digit portfolio. Regardless of political side, people feel screwed, and they will take it out on someone eventually. Ferguson, Baltimore...Wall Street?"

Bush talks about legalizing discrimination in favor of the Christian majority, Christie denies the NSA is a concern, Walker promises to kill unions if elected, and Ben Carson says that Obamacare is the worst thing (freedom-wise I assume) since slavery.\n\nMeanwhile, Bernie Sanders is appealing to a very polarised base; but take a look at his proposals. However outlandish some may be or seem to be (taxing financial transactions to pay for public college tuition, raising the minimum wage to $15, using the stick instead of the carrot on corporations to keep more jobs here in America), you have to admire the chasm that separates the character of appeals being made within both parties at the time - not to mention the guy is doing an AMA later today.\n\nI would wager most of the readers browsing this article are disillusioned with how petty and stupid politics can be at some times - however, regardless of your affiliation it shouldn't be difficult to identify a genuine candidate with genuine concern for the American people and a genuine (if sometimes erroneous depending on your political tilt) desire to improve this country. \n\nGive me an honest man or woman with an imperfect platform and a serious debate can be had over what's best for this country.

Too many people give him a pass for getting virtually nothing done his first two years, despite having a supermajority in Congress. \n\nI voted for him twice, but this is wishful revisionist history. Obama has been a right)leaning moderate for most of his Presidency, it is only recently, now that he has no more elections to win, that he has begun to voice a semblebce of a liberal agenda. He shouldn't get a pass for that.

aS'So almost everything Sanders says falls apart under learned analysis, but on the surface seems to benefit the population. \n\nThere are several things wrong with this particular policy he\'s espousing:\n\nThe biggest problem is that he\'s attacking this from the wrong direction. [Extremely high government spending, subsidies, and subsidized loans are exactly the cause of soaring tuition rates.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-college-tuition-costs-so-much.html?_r=0) Here sanders is doing the populist thing of "Hey students, I\'ll give you money!" when the economic thing is to actually stop giving away money to schools. All this will do is immediately cause tuition to go up again, creating a worse problem down the line. \n\nThe economic theory is that schools lately have faced a completely price-insensitive payer: the US government, and so naturally have kept raising prices far beyond inflation or costs or anything else would dictate. \n\nOn the taxing stock transactions side, it\'s a complicated issue but several points against it:\n1. The US economy is still in a VERY fragile economy. GDP growth this year was 0% in Q1, quite a poor number (There\'s a seasonal winter effect, but still). It\'s well established economics that a transaction tax slows the velocity of money in the system, which then slows reinvestment and growth. Any macroeconomic participant will tell you that it\'s a pretty bad idea to do this for the US right now. \n\n2. Sanders is proposing a gigantic, unrealistic tax. At 0.50%, it\'s larger than almost every transaction tax in the world, most of which are around 0.10%. The US at one point in history had a 0.04% tax. \n\n3. Historically, most financial transaction taxes end up creating FAR less tax profits than expected (see Sweden, etc). Most remaining investment moves offshore to avoid the tax, and all you do is kill your financial centers, like NYC and Chicago. Believe me, London, Frankfurt, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sao Paolo, would LOVE to take over the US\'s position as a financial hub. \n\nThere are many many more points against further financial taxes, but I doubt you could find a single economist who would say this is a good idea for the US right now. \n\nAnyway, the reason I\'m personally not a fan of Sanders or Warren is they push the "us against them" fiction and loudly push policies that on the surface punish the "baddies" and help the populace, but in reality would have very negative broad-based effects. I don\'t have all the answers on how to fix the problems that the US faces, but it\'s certainly not the ridiculously simple solutions that these populist guys tout. \n\nI wish there was a middle case between Hilary and Sanders who is more grounded in reality and science/economics.

aS"The difference is the bully pulpit. I don't think you remember the 1980s. Reagan was elected on an enormous wave, big enough to scare the hell out of the Democrats  (who controlled the House and Senate). Reagan still got most of what he wanted.\n\nShould Sanders be elected it would be a shakeup of similar magnitude. The electoral map might not end up as blue as it was red in 1980, but I will guarantee that the opposition would be terrified of missteps.\n\nLook to the GOP in Texas to see it already happening  (pot legalization for recreational use proposed by a conservative Christian lawmaker, movement of a medical bill).\n\nBernie has a shot at legislation that I don't think Hillary has.

Employee-owned business models could be another. \n\nThe "increase" in taxes we saw in January were the following;\n\n* Top marginal tax rate increased from 35% to 39.6% - Still well below historical highs.\n* Top marginal rate on long-term capital gains and dividends increased from 15% to 20%\n* The estate tax was increased from 35% to 40% on estate\'s worth more than (roughly) $5,000,00 (which ends up being like less than 10,000 families).\n\nI would also not expect such a modest increase in taxes that\'s only been collected for the last 5 months to have any considerable impact on the economy so soon afterwords.\n\nAfter tax corporate profits are the highest they\'ve been since before the great depression. The share of wealth and income to the top 1% is the highest it\'s been since the great depression.\n\n"If your income was in the top 40%, youve likely seen your wealth go up in the past two decades. If you are in the bottom 60, its probably gone down. The top 10% has seen their median net worth increase 61% since 1989." - http://graphics.wsj.com/inequality-in-america/\n\nSo, okay, increasing taxes on the wealthy doesn\'t solve anything. How do we solve the growing income and wealth gap? If you don\'t think it\'s a problem I\'d say go check out Robert Reich\'s movie "Inequality for All" where he makes a pretty convincing argument that such extreme disparities in wealth are a threat to democracy itself. And things like Citizens United (which Bernie Sanders wants to overturn with a Constitutional Amendment) only exacerbates the issue - http://mic.com/articles/87719/princeton-concludes-what-kind-of-government-america-really-has-and-it-s-not-a-democracy\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig\n'

aS'The same thing has often happened in Canada.  The New Democratic Party (NDP) is a democratic socialist (or social democratic) political party with roots in 1920s populism and the Social Gospel.  They\'ve formed governments at different times in 6 of Canada\'s 10 provinces (most recently in [Alberta, in a **huge** election shocker;](http://www.wsj.com/articles/left-leaning-party-sweeps-to-power-in-canadas-oil-rich-alberta-1430883613) imagine Bernie Sanders being elected governor of Texas) and in Yukon territory. They\'ve never formed a federal government, but they *did* come second in the 2011, their best showing ever.\n\nAnyhow.  Ask Canadians about specific policy stands the NDP has, without mentioning the party name, and majorities of those polled regularly say "Yeah, good idea."  Then ask those same Canadians if they\'d ever consider voting NDP, and majorities regularly say "Not with a gun to my head."\n\n(Fortunately, after the Alberta upset, [more and more Canadians are seeing the NDP as a potential winner](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/05/15/federal-liberals-ndp-tories-in-three-way-tie-poll.html) in this year\'s federal election, scheduled for October.

You would shift the burden of the investment from students and their families to people managing their investments in the stock and bond market.  With quantative easing bonds already cannot compete with inflation.  And Sanders want to add a tax to bonds, a good faith investment with the federal government? As for stocks, I am no fan of high frequency trading but this massive sector would either need an exemption or would be ended overnight.  \n\nAs for our current bridges, roads, sewage systems, etc., all of these need attention.  The government has failed to plan for the inevitable decay of these structures.  The government could not handle the management of power generation.  You are talking about the government seizure of private assets my friend.  As soon as you cross that line the Great Depression and the 2007 crash will look minor problems.  As soon as the free market is impinged investment risk will outweigh the reward.  A crash the like he have never seen will occur.  And do you know who profits from crashes?

They have a market, like we do, and innovations like we do (I think this is where Americans misunderstand European countries and think they\'re full-blown socialists). They (the scandinavians) are like everywhere else with a mixture of policies that structures their society.

Democratic Socialism is not the government owning the economy.  \n\nDemocratic Socialism is partly about "socializing" programs best suited for the government, which performs better than the private sector in some areas.

So $25,000 in and out loses $250 automatically per trade, then add in commissions. A 1% tax on transaction amount has been proposed in the past, it never took and with good reason. Even if you have some retirement account that invests in the stock market using mutual funds or some equivalent, that money is coming out of your pocket every time your fund makes a bulk order which they do all the time.

aS"This article bullshit. First of all national polling doesn't account for the fact that in many states, the polls would look very different. We are federation not a unitary state. So even if 50% wants socialism, it could be that they run big numbers up in places like CA and NY. Ask a 18-29 year old from SC, TN, or AL and you probably have different results if you poll just those states. You can't impose drastic changes without a serious fight. If half of what Bernie Sanders wanted passed on party line votes, we would have a civil war on our hands . The People's Republic of Reddit may like him, but just as many would probably take to arms in the event socialism  ever came about. Democracy and Ochlocracy are not the same. The minority can't simply be ignored if you actually want a successful functioning state.. Also Mother Jones is garbage as far reporting goes. The polling also shows that 18-29 year olds are also the least likely to know what socialism is. So drawing conclusions from a limited set of data that doesn't account for major differences in different states gives us no reasonably reliable conclusions. We have a federal constitutional republic, not a unitary state as Mother jones seems to think congress and the presidency have unlimited power."

Absolutely not, he had to make a lot of concessions along the way to get the right to agree to pass it. It could be a lot better, and it was a lot better in its original inception.\n\nBut the point is that Obamacare in its current iteration is better than nothing at all. Is it ideal? No. But if Obama hadn't compromised at all on any points then it would never have passed, and we would have gotten no progress instead of some progress.\n\nAnd while Obama had a more favorable congress and senate at the time ACA passed, he didn't have such an overwhelming majority that they could push anything they wanted through. Compromise is necessary to get anything passed, no matter the state of congress or the senate.\n\nAlso, you have to remember that Sanders also had a left-wing government when Obama passed the ACA, and yet Sanders was unable to pass anything then either.\n\nSo while you're right that the current republican-dominated government does explain Sanders' (or any left-wing legislator's) inability to pass anything now, it does not explain his inability to pass anything *even when we had a democrat-dominated government* in the past.\n\nHe has not shown the ability to compromise or propose reasonable bills that garner enough support from both sides of the aisle to pass, no matter who is in control of the government. That's concerning, at least to me, because no matter who is in charge of the government, the fact remains that you *must* compromise to pass anything."

aS'&gt;I think what you\'re missing is that there is a spectrum for these definitions.\n\nNo, I\'m very well versed in what the different types of capitalism and socialism are.  I\'m just not sure that you know what socialism is.  \n\n&gt;Those European countries are not capitalist countries.\n\nYes, they are.  Again, let\'s look at Norway.  They use Nordic capitalism. Nordic capitalism refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state.  \n\n&gt;They use a very large % of their GDP for socialized programs.\n\nWhich, again, is a welfare state and not socialism.  A welfare state is a concept of government in which the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. \n\n&gt;See, you\'re being lenient with the mark of "capitalist," but not "socialist."\n\nTo me, it is you who is not being lenient.  You are saying that these European countries, who are self described capitalist are not.  They are socialist in your mind, because you buy into the same definition of socialism as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  There are many different types of socialism such as state socialism, agrarian socialism, common ownership, etc.  Europe meets none of these.  Furthermore, given what you are describing as socialism, there are no capitalist countries in the West, but surely the United States is right?  The biggest difference between Nordic Countries and the US is that they have a larger welfare state, but both the US and Europe have welfare states.  A welfare state is independent of both economic models, as they are found and not found in both capitalism and socialism.  \n\n&gt;Unions playing a large role in deciding where profits go is a more "socialized" model than when no unions exist.\n\nRight, but "socialized" does not mean socialism.  Otherwise, if I had an ice cream "social" at work, then that would be considered socialism because it has the word "social" in it.  \n\nSocialism is clearly defined as social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy.  In socialist economics, socialization is the process of structuring or restructuring an economy on a socialist basis, usually by establishing a system of production for use in place of the profit system, along with the end of the operation of the laws of capitalism. In its most developed form, the concept of socialization entails the end of money and financial valuation in the production process.  [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_(economics))\n\n&gt;A business owner can\'t make decisions about his business while workers strike. \n\nThat\'s emphatically not true. If he decides to sell the company while workers on strike he has made a major decision.  Unions are not owners of the company.  Unions are just an organization of workers who have a common goal.    \n\n&gt;There\'s also differing in definitions. See what Noam Chomsky says about political definitions like "libertarian" and "anarchy," to see how far definitions can differ.\n\nEverything that I have just defined in this reply is straight from wikipedia, which is referenced to economic textbooks.  If you have taken an economics class in college you would see similar definitions.  You, however have made almost every country socialist, just because you believe that social welfare is socialism which it isn\'t.  That\'s a fact, and isn\'t debatable.  \n\n\n&gt;Fact is, a living politician called a democratic socialist is synonymous with many social democrats of Europe. Their views are very similar. Sander\'s views match very well with how many EU countries operate\n\nFact is there are democratic socialist in the EU, and lots in Nordic countries, but their countries are capitalist states.  Just like Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist in the US, which is a capitalist state.  \n\n\n&gt;Sanders often advocates for the US to mimic Denmark. Maybe you can argue Sanders misrepresents himself with this label of democratic socialist. But his views are implemented in many countries.\n\n\nSanders is pushing for a larger welfare state such as the one in Denmark.  However, Denmark, is a free market economy.  NOw that we know that welfare state does not mean socialism, we aren\'t going to try and say that a free market economy is **not** capitalism are we?\n\nDenmark\'s economy stands out as one of the most free in the Index of Economic Freedom and the Economic Freedom of the World. [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark#Economy)\n\n&gt; Socialism is a complete opposite, where everyone has possession.\n\nNow, that is a definition I can agree with, however it contradicts everything else you said.  Nordic countries do not have social ownership of the country.  Unions do not have social ownership of a company.  \n\n&gt;Public educations is a socialized program. Socialized medicine works similarly. See definitions from wiki[1] if you want.\n\nSocialized programs **ARE NOT** socialism.  Social programs are welfare subsidies used to help the population.  It is not social ownership of the means of production.  That is what the definition of socialism is.  Welfare, again, is not socialism.  Just because it has the word social in it does not make it socialism.  This is common knowledge that you would pick up in any economics 101 class.  I find it hilarious how some would not like the way FOX news vilifys socialism and then use the same definition for socialism themselves.  \n\n&gt;Because we live in a democracy, this use of taxation is socialist.\n\nNo, that\'s wrong.  Taxation is not socialism.  This conversation is exasperating because you fail to grasp or don\'t want to grasp, the simple definitions of what welfare, capitalism, socialism, and taxation are.  I don\'t mean that to be rude, but it\'s like me talking to someone and them telling me that the sky is not blue, and that I am the one who is close minded, when it is obvious to anyone else that the sky is blue.  The school of economics disagrees with what you say socialism is.  The countries you say are socialist declare themselves as capitalists.  There is clearly nowhere we can move forward with in this conversation.  \n'

It's okay to want a leader who probably has a different set of views and experiences than the norm.\n\n"

aS"Not sure about Warren on this issue, but Sanders voted against both Iraq wars, opposed Vietnam, etc. He does seem to believe America has a role in the world, but it isn't military might, and it isn't trying to solve everyone else's problems for them."

aS'Well, it\'s not exactly a new position for Clinton...not yet anyway.  Back in 2007, [her platform](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/10/12/clinton) included tuition tax credits, bigger Pell Grants, etc. That qualifies as "as debt-free as possible", but it\'s not the same as Sander\'s "College for All".  People should understand that a proposal and a talking point are not equivalent.\n\nI do love how Sanders is driving the conversation in Clinton\'s absence, but it\'s going to take more than just a few exciting ideas.  Clinton does need to be a heck of a lot more open and transparent, and if quotes like, "as debt-free as possible" will easily dissipate the heat, it\'s hard to see how this is really making a difference.'

aS'&gt;"I believe that the TPP is a disastrous agreement and I am working as hard as I can to see it defeated. One of the reasons that the middle class of this country is disappearing is because we have lost some 60,000 factories since 2001 and millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs."\n \n&gt;"Given the fact that Latin America is our next-door neighbor, I have been very distressed about the lack of attention that we have paid to Latin America. I applaud President Obama\'s effort to normalize relations with Cuba, a country which I have visited on several occasions. But I think much more can be done to bring the United States and Latin America closer and to improve relationships with a continent that faces many economic and social problems."\n\n&gt;"There is no question but that automation and robotics reduce the number of workers needed to produce products. On the other hand, there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done in this country. Our infrastructure is crumbling and we can create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, rail system, airports, levees, dams, etc. "\n\n&gt;"Well, that is a very big hypothetical. Yes I do believe that there can be just wars. But, you are talking to somebody who opposed Vietnam, who voted against the first Gulf War, who voted against the War in Iraq and who believes the United States has been far far too aggressive militarily in the last many years. We have got to work with the international community not only in trying to create peaceful resolutions to conflict, but to address the underlying causes of war. This is not easy stuff. But that is the direction in which we have to move."\n\n&gt;"As the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, I share your concern very deeply. The recently-passed Republican budget makes massive cuts in almost every governmental agency, including those engaged in our scientific research. This is a disaster. If we are going to address the major health issues facing our society -- Alzheimer\'s, diabetes, cancer, etc. -- we need to invest more in research and develop the best research centers in the world."\n\n&gt;"Let me just say this -- the state of Vermont voted to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana and I support that. I have supported the use of medical marijuana. And when I was mayor of Burlington, in a city with a large population, I can tell you very few people were arrested for smoking marijuana. Our police had more important things to do."\n\n&gt;"I voted against the USA Patriot Act and voted against reauthorizing the USA Patriot Act. Obviously, terrorism is a serious threat to this country and we must do everything that we can to prevent attacks here and around the world. I believe strongly that we can protect our people without undermining our constitutional rights and I worry very very much about the huge attacks on privacy that we have seen in recent years -- both from the government and from the private sector. I worry that we are moving toward an Orwellian society and this is something I will oppose as vigorously as I can."\n\n&gt;"I respectfully disagree. It is not my view, nor have I suggested, that GMO food causes health problems. What I have said is that the people of our country, as well as people around the world, have the right to make choices in terms of what they eat and have the right to have labels telling them whether or not food is made with GMOs. As you know, GMO labeling exists in dozens of countries and the state legislature in Vermont also passed a bill requiring that. I support that effort."\n\nAnd that\'s just some of the top posts.  Sanders was *far* more forthcoming than most politicians who have done AMAs.'

Veto it and let the pre ACA status quo march on for 20 years, which is what happened when the last progressive healthcare push failed (hillarycare).\n\n'

One of the answers you quoted had the original question:\n\n&gt;In 2014 you expressed that the decriminalization of recreational marijuana use is not a major issue, but also added that you would look into it.  [...] can you update your opinion on the war on drugs?\n\n(I shortened it a bit).  His reply:\n\n&gt;Let me just say this -- the state of Vermont voted to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana and I support that. I have supported the use of medical marijuana. And when I was mayor of Burlington, in a city with a large population, I can tell you very few people were arrested for smoking marijuana. Our police had more important things to do.\n\nThis was too down the middle for me.  Sanders is being billed as a guy with balls that's willing to take a stand.  If he believes it's a non-issue, say you are going to push Federal legalization, if he has reservations, say that instead.  We have had too many down the middle answers over the past infinity decades.\n"

Sanders has been "flogging" these same issues for many, many years, so of course he will have pre-crafted his responses.

The vote on cloture is the important action.\n\nSen. Paul making a long speech against these programs is a good thing, debating is supposed to be part of what Congress does.

p2112
aS"&gt;Btw, why doesn't Bernie Sanders join Paul in this filibuster?\n\nBecause this is about the role of large overbearing government should play in our lives. Sanders believes that government is good, and can do everything for everyone. This is a filibuster on large government more than anything, of which Sanders is a proponent of.\n\nSanders is also an extremely partisan politician, and has one of the worst track records for working across the aisle. He has specifically gone after Republicans that hold some of the same views he has, for just being Republicans. He will go out of his way to not work with Republicans, even if he has the same views and beliefs with them.\n\nThe most recently is Loretta Lynch. He criticized Republicans for being against her nominations, saying they had no real reason to be opposed to her nomination. When, many Republicans, especially Rand, were against her because of Asset Forfeiture. Lynch is a Wall St. insider, and is extremely soft on financial criminals, you think he would join with Republicans and add that to the debate, but nope, he criticized Republicans, then applauded when he rubber stamped her nomination and blamed Republicans that it took so long.\n\nSanders is nothing but a partisan hack, and embodies everything that is wrong in Washington, by not working together with other parties."
p2113
aS"Sanders is a partisan hack, who would rather not show his face siding with a Republican. While I have no doubt that he would vote against any extension, Sanders would rather not show support with Republicans, which he is against.\n\nSanders is just as bad, if not worse, not working with Republicans because they are Republicans, than Republicans who won't work with Obama because he is Obama."
p2114
aS'What has Sanders done to stop the Patriot act?  He votes no when a majority votes yes.  And you applaud him for that.  Well woopity do. \n\nAt least paul is attempting to bring a debate about the issue, whether this is a filibuster or not, he has said that he want a debate in congress on the patriot act before the renewal.  Sanders on the other hand is running around going "I\'m going to run for president where I can totally change things"  Except he can\'t... as we\'ve seen from Obama, or he can and chooses not to. '
p2115
aS"Was pointing out that if Sanders joined in, it would help bring more attention to Rand Paul than to Sanders.  But then again, that may not be his real reason.\n\nAnother reason might be that filibusters are a game of endurance, and Paul is much younger that Sanders.  That's not to say Sanders does not have the health require to be president, but rather you tend to not be able to run marathons as you age.\n\n"

[He specifically called out Republicans because they had  no real reason to stop her nomination.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yF4uS3xPNU) Paul, Lee, Cruz, and numerous other Republicans came out against her because of Asset Forfeiture, and proprietorial discretion which allowed her to let bankers get away with her crimes free of charge. \n\nThe last time I checked, Sanders is against big banks, and Wall St., you would think he would be willing to work with Republicans against a nominee who is nothing but a Wall St. insider, but nope, he flat out criticized them, then applauded when he rubber stamped her nomination, and then criticized Republicans for making her nomination take so long.\n\nSanders is nothing but a partisan hack. He can't work with Republicans, and won't, purely because they are Republicans."

aS'First we have to really understand the problem. What\'s the root of it?\n\nPersonally, I agree with [Lawrence Lessig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2z9lV3W1g)\'s assessment that monetary corruption within the political system is the root of this problem. This one problem screws over the people again and again, as they find that any time that corporate interests conflict with public interests, the corporate masters get their way. The monetary corruption problem has be be solved first so that other social reforms can take place unhindered.\n\nAs for how we do that, a few dedicated groups I know of are:\n\n* [Mayday PAC](http://mayday.us) - Lessig\'s "SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs"\n\n* [Wolf PAC](http://wolf-pac.com) - PAC formed by Cenk Uygur (from The Young Turks) to gain momentum towards a constitutional amendment through state legislatures for overturning Citizens United and getting money out of politics\n\n* [Rootstrikers](http://rootstrikers.org) - Lessig\'s pre-Mayday group for action on this issue\n\nI recommend that you check these groups out and see if you want to throw your support behind any of them. I support them all.\n\nAlso, Bernie Sanders is calling for a grassroots political revolution to create a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and get money out of politics. So you may want to support his campaign as well, inform your friends and family about him, and help get that grassroots revolution rolling.'

aS'Here is what Sanders mentioned his main objectives were in his AMA yesterday.\n\n&gt;Great question. And let me repeat what I have said many times. The only way we deal with the major issues facing our country -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens United, demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, making college affordable for all, etc. -- is when ordinary people put massive pressure on the Congress.\n\nNot addressing the fact that he wants people to act through the government, by putting pressure on their congress to pass laws, we can go through all of those one by one.\n\n* raising the minimum wage to a living wage\n\nSanders wants to raise the minimum wage by forcing companies to pay more, or else. He doesn\'t want to address the root cause to why people aren\'t making a minimum wage, he just wants the government to step in and tell people to pay more.\n\n[Source](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/237072-republicans-blocks-sanders-minimum-wage-amendment)\n\n* rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure\n\nSanders only thinks this is possible by taxing people, and spending money. He thinks government spending $1 Trillion dollars will completely fix the problems.\n\n[Source](http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/230866-sen-sanders-files-1t-infrastructure-bill)\n\n* addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens\n\nSanders believes the way to fix climate change is to tax companies more, and subsidize clean energy, and have the government offer rebates.\n\n[Source](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-boxer-propose-climate-change-bills)\n\n* overturning Citizens United\n\nBy literally proposing a Constitutional Amendment.

p2154
aS'I wish everyone would realize how bad an idea this is.  I sorta wish a GOP introduced it than everyone here wouldn\'t be so blinded because their savior Bernie Sanders is the one behind it and would be able to critically look at the idea. \n\nThere was a post earlier that was saying how more and more people are getting degrees only to work at Starbucks or someplace.  This makes perfect sense.  If everyone who wants to go to college is able too then you diminish the value of the degree greatly.  Or rather I should say, if everyone who THINKS they need to go to college.  \n\nThere\'s very very few jobs anymore that you can get simply based on having a degree.  Maybe 30yrs ago or so having a degree would get you a decent job right out of school now employers are flooded with new college degree applicants and it really becomes not about the degree but who you know inside the company. \n\nThe current system is government guarantees student loans. A student gets a loan after being bullshitted that they\'re going to get a great job and that college is an investment in their life!!  Colleges knowing that students can get funding jack of their rates year after year.  Student graduations with tens of thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands in debt that they must pay off.  Sanders plan does nothing to incentivise colleges to lower costs or make cuts. Sure it will be "free" as in you won\'t see a bill each month but it will be far from free in reality. \n\nSo what should the solution be?  \n\n*1. I think we should cut off all guaranteed loans this will force colleges too lower rates or else not enough people would be able to attend.  \n\n*2. Cooperate with the states to create some sort of merit based tuition assistance program.  Everyone that has a 3.0 or higher gpa out of high school would qualify. The program would pay between 50-70% of your total tuition costs based on your gpa and you\'d need to attend a state college of the state you\'re a residence in. If a student would like to attend a private or out of state college then they\'d only be awarded whatever the federal contribution would of been.  \n\n*3.  If a person has a gpa lower than 3.0 they have the option of simply paying out of pocket to the school they desire or they can go to the more affordable community college.  They also can reapply to assistance in 2years.  So if they maintain a 3.0 gpa in their first 2 years of college then they can get assistance for the remainder.\n\n*4.  Everyone getting this assistance would be need to maintain at minimum a 2.5 average year after year.  If they fail to meet that requirement they would go on probation for a year, if they still don\'t bring their grades up in that year then they lose 50% of their assistance.  If after that they are able to bring their average back up then full aid is restored.  If they aren\'t able to then they lose their aid completely and have to wait 2 years or 3 semesters to reapply again.   \n\nI think this will work much better then the "free" college for all idea because the taxpayers would be secure in knowing they are investing in the future by helping the best and brightest.  Students would learn the value of personal responsibility and doing the best job they can in school in order to get the most assistance and since that assistance doesn\'t pay 100% they would still need to either get scholarships, private loans, or work part time to make up the difference, this will teach them financial responsibility as well and finally while probably won\'t have the same effect at reducing college tuition if we were to just cut off all aid and let everyone pay for themselves. I believe it would still have an effect at reducing tuition rates since government wouldn\'t be guaranteeing 100% of the cost.\n\n'

You\'re acting like he\'s swooping in with a tool called "government" and going to work where work has never been done before.\n\n&gt;School is too expensive?

I know that both Senators voted against that,  I only mentioned the NDAA, which Sanders had opposed every year until this last one.  The language in the bill didn't change,  it was only a funding bill,  so why did BS change his position on such a terrible bill?\n\nAlso in terms of the Food Stamp program, you are the one lying here.  Highlights taken directly from the legislation; \n\n&gt;Repeals the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which authorized a federal supplemental nutrition assistance program to provide nutrition assistance to low-income households.\n\n&gt; Limits appropriations for grants to states for supplemental nutrition assistance programs to $45 billion each year, beginning in 2013. (This clearly is limiting spending on food stamps! )\n\n&gt; Requires states to certify that they will provide supplemental nutrition assistance only to citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States, and that they will take all necessary actions to ensure that benefits are not provided to individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents.\n\nAnd why would BS not want Executive Branch EMPLOYEES to disclose their financial transactions?

The fact that you donated $20-$100 and signed up to volunteer (it\'s also the only way to receive emails from him I think) means nothing.\n\nHowever, the effect here is the same, some large number of the pro-Sanders users show up in every Sanders thread (and even all of the (occasional) Hillary threads that find their way to /r/politics) and the discussion is significantly distorted.\n'

Highlights taken directly from the legislation\n\nYou are right that that is what that legislation did. You are right that that is terrible. You are wrong in that you are alleging Sanders supported that - he voted against that legislation. Do you not understand what tabling means?

aS'&gt; I\'m taking from this that you are one of the people who believes that Hillary Clinton wants to work to rectify the injustice of maldistribution. \n\nAll this sounds a bit too much like "Claude Hooper Bukowski" who believes in God and believes that God believes in Claude.  I don\'t think anyone is that naive. \n\nI think Hillary would favor ending maldistribution.  I think that the roots of maldistribution in the US go back to Nixon, that Nixon was a violation of the good that some Republicans had done, and by some I refer to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, and that during the Eisenhower period and then Kennedy-Johnson period the US had made dramatic strides toward reducing maldistribution.\n\nNo person is all good or all bad, although Nixon was certainly a prototype of evil and much of the problem of rising maldistribution we have faced and face today appear at least to be related to Republicans who followed Ford.\n\nBut part of the problem of rising maldistribution was because of the success at reducing maldistribution that America had experienced up to and including Lyndon Johnson: successes like recovery from the depression, like the GI Bill, like the end of racism in sports but these became associated with Johnson and with the Democratic party.  Johnson too did great things for civil rights.  But as result, Republicans formed a coalition against Johnson based on increasing maldistribution. And various outgrowths of the Republican party since Nixon have geared toward increasing maldistribution "in reaction to" what Johnson and the Democrats had achieved, because the Republican party could capture a a huge reactionary movement against civil rights.   Objectively you could not say that Johnson and the Democrats were "united" at their core on many issues, they were largely united in support of economic freedom for all  including those who had been wrongfully oppressed.   \n\nThe Republican view was that they could create a party by trying to stop this and thus became opposed to any efforts like the GI-Bill, like dual-use and its ability to provide research education which themselves provide both business and military research and capable entrants into the growth economy, and therefore competitive advantage for the United States.  Thus the efforts of Republicans, regardless belief or slogan wind up as both a full attack on the economic advantage of the United States, an abuse and ultimate deterioration of military power, an attack on economic freedom and an attack on sustainability.\n \nToday  I hear the RW deplore terms like democracy and equality and one-man one vote, which are  words I grew up with that I associate mathematically with the very strength of this country.  But their attack on these words, as ideologically based as they may seem are an attack on the strength and resilience of the United States.\n\nDoes Bernie Sanders understand all of that?  Maybe.  But if we think that some single politician is "God" and God believes in Claude, that is not likely to prove correct or useful whether its Sanders or Clinton or whoever.   \n'

p2200
aS'I see a lot of people focusing on the amount they have been fined and questioning whether or not they made profit. This is missing the point in my opinion. We are giving banks free reign to break the law and if they get caught the worst possible outcome is losing money. This is the same risk people take when trying to start a new business, how can you justify treating breaking the law as a business venture? It\'s a dangerous precedent.\n\nAs for why they are not being punished, I think most people are aware of why, they just don\'t like to admit it. No doubt there is a series of factors, one of which is these banks are some of the biggest donors to candidates on both sides of the political spectrum. Most of our politicians are not willing to bite the hand that feeds them.\n\nAnother reason why they are not treated like criminals is they are too big to fail. Pushing for criminal charges could have a negative effect on the economy because these banks are so large. Holder himself admitted that they are too big to jail, he later tried to retract this statement because the outrage it caused but we all know he was telling the truth. The HSBC drug money laundering case acted as a litmus test to determine whether banks were too big to jail or not. Once again the DOJ, being led by the current AG Loretta Lynch, opted to settle for a fine.\n\nThese banks are above the law and they know it. They openly lobby against reform and donate to politicians who will help maintain the status quo and gut bills like Dodd Frank. Some people like Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders have been tackling these banks hard but there is only so much they can do. Warren herself has admitted that taking on this trillion dollar industry scares her because they are so powerful. A great piece of insight into how powerful these bankers are came though one of Warrens books. In it she writes about how during a meeting with Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon she confronted him about his bank breaking the law. When faced with these accusations he doesn\'t even try to deny it, he just grinned and said "Fine us, we can afford it". They know as long as they never use incriminating words directly they can plead plausible deniability and get away with anything.'

He is also playing the same crowd as Sanders and I think that is what you are worried about because he might actually pull people away from Sanders and ruin his chances.  That is just politics and Sanders not being proactive.  Yeah, Sanders engaged us on Reddit.  Great!  Paul protested for 10.5 hours on national security to keep the government out of our internet in the bedroom.  Somebody clearly looks good right now if he did nothing.

I'm pretty opposed to the dynasty thing.  \n\nI would venture to say that Hillary, and all of her baggage, is probably going to survive primary process.  Martin O'Malley is pretty disliked within his own state, campaigned heavily on gun control (goodbye southern swing states) and will likely crater as he's trying to commandeer a sector of the base Hillary already commands.  \n\nSanders can unify the far left of the Democrat base, but those blue-dog Democrats aren't going to go for him (and as you venture from the North-East and Pacific Coast, they become far more prevalent).  He's going to have some real problems in Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada (which constitute 75% of the first four primaries).  When we get to Super Tuesday, he's probably not going to carry the following states: Colorado caucuses, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and North Carolina.  He's going to be so far behind by that point that I can't imagine he stays in the race.  \n\nI'm personally going for Rand Paul and I think that he has a better shot, though still not good, than Sanders does of getting the Nomination.  The Republican field is a hell of a lot deeper at this point than the Democrats, so I can't guess how it will go.  However, it's safe to say that the establishment favors Jeb Bush and to a lesser extent Scott Walker (and then Marco Rubio).  The Republicans are in a bit of a civil war so it is feasible that a dark horse could emerge, but we'll see. \n\nThat being said, the Rand Pauls' and Bernie Sanders are likely there solely to steer the national conversation; which while I abhor Sanders' fiscal policies, I agree with him on a lot of Social and Civil Rights issues.  \n\nThat's my take on things though, because if we end up with another Clinton Bush ticket, that would mean that for at least 41 years of my life on this planet (at the time of the end of that term) I would have seen presidents from only 4 families (Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama.  An argument could be made that I saw Carter in the White House, but only for a few months and I 6 months old when he left office) in the White House and only three families since I was 9 years old.  That's certainly a problem. \n"

It suffered heavily by the influx of digg users.\n\nIve got 5 years with this account + years prior lurking.  You're account shows 2 years.. I suspect you werent around to see it.

aS"Why?  Seriously.  Hillary's been a center-left Democrat for going on 40 years.  I never got how people could cheer Bill in the 90s and then go all aghast at his wife.  The Clintons are progressive workhorses when they have a blue Senate/House at their backs.  And they know how to win over corporate support for liberal causes, which *should* be considered a good thing.\n\nShe's no liberal firebrand like Sanders.  But Sanders is less likely to play well in swing states like Florida or Ohio.  Also, Sanders can't raise the $2B+ the GOP is going to swing at this race, and yes that fucking matters.\n\nHillary isn't exactly an inspirational candidate.  But she's got sold left-wing credentials.  The Hillary-hate really doesn't make any sense for anyone that's lived through the ultra-right-wing era of the '80s, '90s, and '00s."

aS"&gt;We also tested the other Democratic hopefuls against Scott Walker but even in this dark blue state, none of them lead him. Bernie Sanders achieves a tie at 35, and the rest of the Democrats trail him- Jim Webb by 1 point at 33/32, Martin O'Malley by 3 points at 34/31, and Lincoln Chafee by 6 points at 35/29. The weak performances of the alternate Democrats are a byproduct of their being so little known that they get only 54-61% of their own party's vote but nevertheless they show how much more formidable Clinton is than anyone else on her side.\n\nMeanwhile\n\n&gt;Clinton leads the GOP hopefuls by anywhere from 10 to 15 points.\n\nSo in a deep blue state Bernie Sanders, who based on this poll has decent name recognition at 58%, but is polling even with Scott Walker, while Hillary easily beats all of them.\n"

So voting on an act that restricts it is way better than nothing. Now if someone wants to write a bill to do away with all that was in the Patriot Act, im all for that. But that is not what was being discussed. It was a bill to put further restrictions on data collection. That is a win. And to say that because Bernie Sanders supports it that he also supports the Patriot Act is disingenuous.'
p2265
aS'I agree with you that it\'s silly to overly criticize Sanders when he hasn\'t yet taken a stand. Sanders has previously stated that he supported the USA Freedom Act, which is disappointing as it would have extended many Patriot Act provisions under the guise of "reform."

aS'he nerfed the shit out of it.\n\n&gt;Sanders had originally used the language of Ron Pauls HR 1207, which passed in the House as an amendment last year, but later changed his amendment under pressure by the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration. Sen. Vitter reintroduced an amendment with the original Audit the Fed language.\n\n&gt; Ron Paul: Bernie Sanders, who was supposed to introduce my amendment and brought it up and at the last minute changed it. And I did have a conversation with him [on Friday, May 7]. He did describe it as, well that was the best he could get, it had to be watered down a bit. There was no way the other one would be passed, that argument.\n\n&gt;I think he has one point. If his bill as it is written, even though its much different than my bill that I introduced, it probably would be better than the rest. But my point to him was that it would be important that we have the Senate at least be on record they havent voted for a much cleaner bill. If it doesnt pass, then offer his as a substitute and pass it. Under those circumstances I may well support it but I would want to go for the best bill.\n\n &gt;But it looks like Vitter may be introducing the much cleaner bill and I know Jim DeMint has worked hard on it. He would be supporting it to come up. Quite frankly I dont think it will pass. I think Bernie is counting the votes, he claims he has to have 60 votes to pass anything. But you know, if Dodd is supporting what Bernie wants to do as well as Reid has said that he would support Sanders, and if theyre supporting it it means the president is going to sign it, and if theyre all supporting it, **I would be very suspicious that the Fed is quite aware of this and theyre satisfied with this and maybe they think theyre getting off the hook.**\n\nhttp://www.ronpaul.com/2010-05-11/sanders-amendment-to-audit-the-fed-passes-96-0/\n'

aS'&gt; Which is really what you socialist Sanders crowd really want isn\'t it?\n\nNo. First, Bernie is a [Democratic Socialist](http://www.dsausa.org/what_is_democratic_socialism). Sanders wants average people to get active and involved in the political process again. With our extremely abysmal voter turnout and domination of money in politics ([and the effects that has brought on how we\'re represented](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9354310)), he\'s calling for a grassroots "political revolution" that works to engage the American people. He wants *the people* to demand changes of their "representatives" which currently, as shown in the study I linked, have influence equivalent to statistical noise compared to the influence of "economic elites and organized groups representing business interests."'

Not sure how they calculated that, since I don\'t see "58" anywhere near Sanders in the full results, but Sanders has 50% of people expressing a favorable/unfavorable opinion of him, while Walker is at 59%, so if we interpret this as "recognition", then he ties with Walker with about the same recognition.'
p2295
aS'So Rand Paul "filibusters" to get out the message that personal digital data is in fact personal and that the government does not have the right  to warrantlessly collect it, and reddit comes down hard on him for doing "essentially nothing" and questions his sincerity.  Sanders says something that has been said a million times, and its front page news, no question of his motives, he is god.

Of course we\'re all aware Sanders won\'t change things magically - just like Obama couldn\'t completely, despite wanting to.\n\nBut electing Sanders would be nothing short of revolutionary, as a political statement from the American people. It would dramatically shift politics and the demographics politicians cater to in America, forever. It would signal that new generations know bullshit when they see it, and that politicians need to change their game accordingly.\n\nThe "socialist Sanders crowd" is bigger than you think - it includes your children and grandchildren, even if you personally consider yourself more conservative. It\'s just that their voice has been muffled by apathy, and dark money controlling elections.'

aS"You are right, according to the same methodology mentioned in the fivethirtyeight article, Sanders is the MOST liberal senator of our time. He literally sets the curve on which the other candidates reside on. However, it's just silly to say that because someone isn't the MOST liberal, they can't be liberal. Statistically Hillary is liberal, not as liberal as Sanders, but more liberal than Obama, and certainly more liberal than any of the republican candidates running. "

If Sanders were to die in office, we would get an entirely different presidency with Paul. Maybe they can coalition build in Congress, but not the presidency."
p2300
aS'&gt;One president cannot reorganize the entire federal government, or state governments, or local governments magically UNLESS you were to completely centralize power into the hands of one person.\n\nNo, but if we can get Sanders elected, we can kick out all the dickheads currently in congress.'

aS'Well, I\'m happy to answer you to the best of my ability.\n\n1. Socialism isn\'t objectively bad, it\'s just closer to how European countries are run. There is a lot to like, especially in terms of how the society cares for the lower class. I think the left wing of US voters likes Bernie because he is the most left politician in our Senate, and therefore fully supports most everything that left wing voters like. He\'s a zero compromise left wing candidate. That would be comparible to someone like Rick Sanatorum or Ted Cruz on the republican side.\n\n2. Hillary being un-electable is pretty much only a reddit thing, which is a tiny subsection of the population and not representative of the population at large. From the beginning Hillary has been absolutely dominating the polls against republicans and other democrats alike. This is where the inevitable aspect of her candidacy comes in. \n\nPersonally I\'m not really high on Hillary or Sanders. Hillary is a pretty middle of the road democrat, who would probably be more like Obama than anything else. Sanders is great ideologically for me (as a liberal), but is unlikely to win in a general election. They are both OK I guess.\n\nAnyway, if you are new to politics and interested, I would recommend NOT getting your information solely from reddit as there is a lot of crazy on here. Read other news sources, from reputable sources, and come to your own opinions. Personally I like to look at the candidates stances on the issues / policies and stay clear of manufactured news stories, or character politics such as "how will so and so relate to me, if they eat arugula spinach". Ontheissues is a good website to research that.\n\n'

So,  if nothing is in print about his service or his running away (he did run to Israel to spend a short stint on a kibbutz, he didn\'t last long there) I  would surmise he spent his time hiding out in the woods or in Canada somewhere. I really can see him telling the authorities he was homosexual so as to remain safe during the Vietnam War.\n\nOh well, those are your people so you\'re stuck with them. I just get to laugh at them.

Surely they could get a few others on their side and done tag-team, stand on the floor and read the D.C. phonebook till they killed this.\n\nI keep seeing Sanders offering up populist proposals but I have yet to see him throw down when it counts.

aS'Contents of [PDF] [Bernie Sanders lists 10 problems with the TPP](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file):\n\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: THE TRANS - PACIFIC TRADE (TPP)\nAGREEMENT MUST BE DEFEATED\n\nThe Trans - Pacific Partnership is a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largest multi-national corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy. It will also negatively impact some of the poorest people in the world.\n\nThe TPP is a treaty that has been written behind closed doors by the corporate world. Incredibly, while Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry and major media companies have full knowledge as to what is in this treaty, the American people and members of Congress do not. They have been locked out of the process.\n\nFurther, all Americans, regardless of political ideology, should be opposed to the fast track process which \nwould deny Congress the right to amend the treaty and represent their constituents interests.\n\nThe TPP follows in the footsteps of other unfettered free trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA and the Permanent Normalized Trade Agreement with China (PNTR). These treaties have forced American workers to compete against desperate and low-wage labor around the world. The result has been massive job losses in the United States and the shutting down of tens of thousands of factories. These corporately backed trade agreements have significantly contributed to the race to the bottom, the collapse of the American middle class and increased wealth and income inequality. The TPP is more of the same, but even worse. \n\nDuring my 23 years in Congress, I helped lead the fight against NAFTA and PNTR with China. During the coming session of Congress, I will be working with organized labor, environmentalists, religious organizations, Democrats, and Republicans against the secretive TPP trade deal.\n\nLets be clear: the TPP is much more than a free trade agreement. It is part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system. If TPP was such a good deal for America, the administration should have the courage to show the American people exactly what is in this deal, instead of keeping the content of the TPP a secret.\n\n10 Ways that TPP would hurt Working Families:\n\n 1. **TPP will allow corporations to outsource even more jobs overseas.**\n  * According to the Economic Policy Institute, if the TPP is agreed to, the U.S. will lose more than 130,000 jobs to Vietnam and Japan alone. But that is just the tip of the iceberg.\n  * Service Sector Jobs will be lost.\n  * At a time when corporations have already outsourced over 3 million service sector jobs in the U.S., TPP includes rules that will make it even easier for corporate America to outsource call centers; computer programming; engineering; accounting; and medical diagnostic jobs.\n  * Manufacturing jobs will be lost.\nAs a result of NAFTA, the U.S. lost nearly 700,000 jobs. As a result of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, the U.S. lost over 2.7 million jobs. As a result of the Korea Free Trade Agreement, the U.S. has lost 70,000 jobs.\nThe TPP would make matters worse by providing special benefits to firms that offshore jobs and by reducing the risks \nassociated with operating in low -wage countries.\n\n 2. **U.S. sovereignty will be undermined by giving corporations the right to challenge our laws before international tribunals.**\n   * The TPP creates a special dispute resolution process that allows corporations to challenge any domestic laws that could adversely impact their expected future profits. \n   * These challenges would be heard before UN and World Bank tribunals which could require taxpayer compensation to corporations. \n   * This process undermines our sovereignty and subverts democratically passed laws including those dealing with labor, health, and the environment.\n\n 3. **Wages, benefits, and collective bargaining will be threatened.**\n   * NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and other free trade agreements have helped drive down the wages and benefits of American workers and have eroded collective bargaining rights. \n   * The TPP will make the race to the bottom worse because it forces American workers to compete with desperate workers in Vietnam where the minimum wage is just 56 cents an hour.\n\n 4. **Our ability to protect the environment will be undermined.**\n    * The TPP will allow corporations to challenge any law that would adversely impact their future \nprofits. Pending claims worth over $14 billion have been filed based on similar language in other \ntrade agreements. Most of these claims deal with challenges to environmental laws in a number of countries.\nThe TPP will make matters even worse by giving corporations the right to sue any of the nations that sign onto the TPP.\nThese lawsuits would be heard in international tribunals bypassing domestic courts.\n\n 5. **Food Safety Standards will be threatened.**\n   * The TPP would make it easier for countries like Vietnam to export contaminated fish and seafood into \nthe U.S. The FDA has already prevented hundreds of seafood imports from TPP countries because of salmonella, e-coli, methyl-mercury and drug residues. But the FDA only inspects 1-2 percent of food imports and will be overwhelmed by the vast expansion of these imports if the TPP is agreed to.\n\n 6. **Buy America laws could come to an end.**\n   * The U.S. has several laws on the books that require the federal government to buy goods and services \nthat are made in America or mostly made in this country. Under TPP, foreign corporations must be \ngiven equal access to compete for these government contracts with companies that make products in \nAmerica. Under TPP, the U.S. could not even prevent companies that have horrible human rights \nrecords from receiving government contracts paid by U.S. taxpayers.\n\n 7. **Prescription drug prices will increase, access to life saving drugs will decrease, and the profits of drug companies will go up.**\n   * Big pharmaceutical companies are working hard to ensure that the TPP extends the monopolies they have for prescription drugs by extending their patents (which currently can last 20 years or more). This would expand the profits of big drug companies, keep drug prices artificially high, and leave millions of people around the world without access to life saving drugs. Doctors without Borders stated that the TPP agreement is on track to become the most harmful trade pact ever for access to medicines in developing countries.\n\n 8. **Wall Street would benefit at the expense of everyone else.**\n    * Under TPP, governments would be barred from imposing capital controls that have been successfully used to avoid financial crises. These controls range from establishing a financial speculation tax to limiting the massive flows of speculative capital flowing into and out of countries responsible for the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s. In other words, the TPP would expand the rights and power of the same Wall Street firms that nearly destroyed the world economy just five years ago and would create the conditions for more financial instability in the future. \n    * Last year, I co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Harkin to create a Wall Street speculation tax of just 0.03 percent on trades of derivatives, credit default swaps, and large amounts of stock. If TPP were enacted, such a financial speculation tax may be in violation of this trade agreement.  \n\n 9. **The TPP would reward authoritarian regimes like Vietnam that systematically violate human rights.**\n   * The State Department, the U.S. Department of Labor, Human Rights Watch, and  Amnesty International have all documented Vietnams widespread violations of basic international standards for human rights. Yet, the TPP would reward Vietnams bad behavior by giving it duty free access to  the U.S. market. \n\n 10. **The TPP has no expiration date, making it virtually impossible to repeal.**\n   * Once TPP is agreed to, it has no sunset date and could only be altered by a consensus of all of the countries that agreed to it. Other countries, like China, could be allowed to join in the future. For example, Canada and Mexico joined TPP negotiations in 2012 and Japan joined last year.\n'

aS'Ultimately there are two questions:\n\n1. Should he obstruct the bill from being passed  \n2. Should he support the bill\n\nIf you are opposed to the bill but do not believe it should be obstructed (and Rand is clearly obstructing the bill) then Sanders has done nothing to offend you. If you believe members of Congress should be actively working against passage of the bill, then Sanders has disappointed.\n\nHis vote was to allow passage of the bill. It is unknown yet whether he supports the bill or does not, but we certainly know he does not oppose it to the extent that he will obstruct it.'

aS'According to [this list of Senators and which way they were leaning on votes,](https://www.endsurveillance.com) Bernie Sanders was leaning YES on the Freedom Act.\n\nI think there is some discussion on r/SandersforPresident'

aS'Bernie Sanders has both voted against the Patriot Act and against its extension back in 2011. He still voices his opposition every time it comes up.'
p2342
aS"Just FYI, Sanders has the same stance on NSA surveillance, but isn't a total loon on everything else government related ala Paul.\n\nFor Rand Paul, he only supports ending surveillance because he is anti-government in almost every way.  If there can be smaller government in something, he wants it.  While that makes sense in certain things like drug reform and surveillance, it makes absolutely no sense when it comes to regulating business and the environment."
p2343
aS'No, Sanders is strongly against the Patriot Act.'
p2344
aS'Yup, the libertarians came out hard in this thread, and go figure the top post is Sanders hating BS. Also lets not forget that libertarians are by and large a Koch driven machine, and I generally dont trust, or buy into that small government nonsense.'
p2345
aS'You have to remember Sanders is a socialist. The soundbite is that trade agreements "kill jobs", which may or may not be true depending on the nature of the agreement, but when he talks a little longer about them, it becomes clear that he opposes them for the simple reason that the mobility of capital erodes the negotiating power of labor. Whereas before a trade agreement it may have been possible for a national-scale union to successfully negotiate decent wages from a corporation, once a corporation is able to move jobs to and from other countries, the negotiating power of the union is undermined unless it too scales up to international level. This is not just practical for socialists, but ideological. Economic efficiency is not the top priority. They want labor to control capital. Thus, Sanders is being as consistent with his ideology in opposing trade agreements as Rand Paul is with his own in supporting them.\n\n'
p2346
aS'There is none. They might support more of his policies than not because they have *similar* interests. But when the President steps out of line, the Democratic party is perfectly capable of opposing him. \n\nThe government isn\'t a pyramid with the president at the top, handing down power to his underlings. There are multiple branches, with multiple powers, held by multiple "leaders."\n\nElizabeth Warren would be my guess for the de-facto leader of the Democratic party. She does not do Obamas bidding, she goes her own way.\n\nThe same way Bernie Sanders  is an independent but works with democrats on several issues. He has no leader. No one is telling him how to vote, or what to do other than his constituents. Same for Warren.\n\n'

aS"I'm saying this as a liberal Sanders supporter. If you are pressing the issue of *qualified* with regards to their credentials and experience then I would say Huckabee, Rick Perry, Pataki, Graham, Santorum, Jindal, Kasich.  \n\nYou are not the average voter. I wish the average voter was left leaning, but that's unfortunately not the case."
p2349
aS'At the very least Sanders and mainstream dem presidential candidates are letting paul take the lead on this issue rather than being a leader.  Probably not a bad move on their part, no use making enemies with the security establishment before you are elected.'
p2350
aS'Actually, there have been tons of friendly amendments made to the fast track legislation about opportunities for viewing the trade agreement.  No one hears about it because the text is secret, most politicians have already made up their mind on the trade agreement, and because friendly amendments aren\'t considered by all to be true amendments.\n\nThe fact you think words like "treason" or "economic suicide" fit like a glove scares the hell out of me.  Trade agreements are an important part in keeping up with the global economy.  If we fall behind, it can be disastrous.  Trade agreements are a necessity in the emerging markets, and they also help claim resources we need for cheap.\n\nThe one actual complaint I hear about TPP is that trade agreements ships jobs overseas and hurts wages.  Even Bernie Sanders agrees with those.  It\'s not true.  Trade agreements expand the free market area in the world.  Capitalism drives jobs overseas and lower wages.  Trade agreements provide opportunities for corporations to expand into other countries.  During the month of March this year, car sales by GM and Ford in China almost reached the US sales figures (443,192 vs 485,804).  This could not have been done without China and the US lowering tariffs on each other.  \n\nWe will always see jobs being shipped around the world to the lowest bigger.  What makes the US special is that we have lots of protections like copyright, trademark, and patent protections.  We provide the best opportunities for corporations, we just have a much higher employment cost.  To circumvent high employment cost, we would either have to allow corporations to expand most around the world, increasing revenues and profits, or we have to lower our minimum wage, and other wage expectations.

aS'The only person who could have coming close to beating Hillary Clinton in the primary was Elizabeth Warren, and she\'s not running. Now Warren\'s fan club, who are finally starting to learn that "no means no" are splitting their vote between Hillary and Bernie, and that sounds about right. Now Hillary is starting to poll in the high 60\'s and low 70\'s. Barring a major fuck up of epic proportions, Hillary is untouchable.\n\nThere are those who will bring up how in 2008 Hillary was the presumed candidate and that she was beaten back then by Obama. Now, there\'s a ton of reasons why that comparison isn\'t appropriate not the least of which being that Hillary now has a 5 year stretch as Secretary of State under her belt. But the real reason is because at about this time Hillary was polling in the mid-30\'s and Obama was polling in the mid 20\'s with at least 2-3 other challengers of quality. Any unpartial observer would have concluded that Hilary was in a very strong position to win but was very much not untouchable.\n\nSomeone might think that all Hillary needs is strong competition. And while that might be true, it\'s important to remember that Hillary \'08 wasn\'t beaten by a man -- she was beaten by a movement. Bernie Sanders doesn\'t have a movement; he has a fan club. That makes him a lot more like Dennis Kucinich \'08 than Barack Obama \'08. And her other possible future competitors (who will likely be announcing in the next week or so) have all the charisma and draw of a cold bowl of soggy oatmeal. The wonky law and order technocrat types might like O\'Malley and the blue dogs might like Jim Webb and like the 4 people in Rhode Island who have heard of him will like Lincoln Chafee. But that\'s not a whole lot of Dems. More likely than not these guys are auditioning for Hillary\'s cabinet and won\'t be launching a serious offense.\n\nIs Hillary beatable by a Democrat in 2016? Maybe... but the stars would have to align exactly and they just aren\'t. There\'s no movement, no competition and no large public outcry for one. 70% is a big number. Chipping away at that takes time and money and while there\'s plenty of one there\'s no one with enough of the other.'
p2354
aS"I think my view is that both candidates would reform a lot of things that we need to fix before moving forward.  I'd want Paul to be a one-term president, going in and cleaning up shop through a difficult 4-year process so that we can start rebuilding and moving forward, again.\n\nBernie Sanders, I'd give two terms to do the same and get us a little more in line with Europe when it comes to Economic issues.\n\nBut basically, I see them both as honest reform candidates who will shake up a lot of the things I think need shaking.  They're both anti-war, so I feel we'd have a peaceful time for 4-years while reinvesting that money into our economy to fuel the reform.\n\nI just don't want another business-as-usual candidate, and neither Paul nor Sanders are."

I don\'t like seeing the man portrayed as crazy or unstable or nutso (even though I\'m getting *really* tired of the "Sanders this" and "Sanders that" on Reddit).\n\nThat said, as much as I wish it weren\'t the case, I don\'t think he\'s electable in today\'s political landscape.

aS"[**Should the winner of the popular vote be elected as our president?**](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/11/defending_the_electoral_college.html) We could change our Constitution and our system of government to do this. Should we?\n\nIf we make this change only those in the 10-50 most populous cities will elect our president. Our present systems respects states and communities that are less populous. It gives them some say as well. The Democrats now have a strong advantage in the electoral college, [their BLUE WALL](http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2015/05/breaking_the_democrats_electoral_college_blue_wall.html)\n\nCalifornia took an analogous action. The upper legislative house was [modeled after the US Senate where each county, regardless of population, had an equal vote.](http://reason.org/files/79d00eb443669b026c8c37c483f0bdb0.pdf) The SCOTUS in Wesberry v. Sanders held that  as nearly as is practicable, one person's vote in a  congressional  election is to be worth as much as another's ; and Reynolds v. Sims, which held that the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis.\n\n[If the Los Angeles six-county area were a state, it would surpass all states in total population size with the exception of California and Texas.](http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/press-releases/facts-about-los-angeles) Only Los Angeles voters matter in California elections. People who live 500 miles from LA are essentially disenfranchised.\n\nDo we want our largest cities to exclusively control our presidential elections?"

aS'&gt;Many of the CEOs who signed the deficit-reduction letter run corporations that evaded at least $34.5 billion in taxes\n\nNo, they *avoided* tax. Evasion is illegal, avoidance is legal. \n\n&gt;As a result, at least a dozen of the companies...even received more than $6.4 billion in tax refunds from the IRS since 2008.\n\nSanders is mixing up "tax benefit," which is a GAAP concept, with refunds. A tax benefit isn\'t a refund; it is an ability to offset future tax liabilities.'

aS"If they had net operating losses, then they wouldn't pay tax. You don't pay tax when you don't have net income. \n\nBut most of the banks probably did pay tax.

p2370
aS'&gt; And I should be clear, I believe most Sanders voters \'get it\' ---and by all indications, Sanders does too, and after dragging Hillary and the general discussion to the left, he will likely endorse her.\n\nI thought this had kinda been clear from the start, so the tone of the infighting is surprising. Debate the merits of their platforms. Leave the hyperbolic personal attacks up to the Republicans.\n\nThe endgame Bernie is shooting for is to establish the left as safe territory for Hillary to occupy. The better the case he makes, and the better showing he makes in the Primary, the more she can comfortably step left in her rhetoric, mitigating the inevitable Republican cries of "socialist!"\n\nI believe she (and Obama, for that matter) are way more lefty than their rhetoric or political actions would suggest. They\'ve merely stayed within the bounds that allowed them to survive and be effective in their careers. If consensus moves left, she will too, and that\'s not something she should be attacked over... it\'s exactly what we want, and it\'s achievable.  Right now, that\'s Plan A.'

aS"Socialism is not Communism.  Many people seem to not be able to make the distinction between the two.\n\nUnchecked Capitalism has led to the greatest income disparity in American history.  If it is left as it is we will all be Serfs for our Corporate Masters.  I am not saying that Bernie Sanders has all the right answers. He does recognize that the current system is completely broken and is closer to falling apart than most people realize.\n\nThe entire world NEEDS America to succeed.  They still drive the world economy. Someone has to buy all the stuff they make in China.  It will not succeed if it does not change.  What that change needs to be is beyond me. Unlike most people on the internet, I don't claim to have all the answers.  I can spot a problem though. "

p2375
aS'So, these taxes come from the individuals who make up the general public is what you\'re saying.\n\nIf the taxes, when it come down to it, are collected from everyone, then why do we need the government to tell us what we want, how much it costs, and then collect the money? \n\nWhere is the magic that the government engages in that somehow means it can provide a more efficient solution that addresses the needs of more people in a better way than markets? \n\nAnd when Bernie Sanders floats a $1T infrastructure plan, what he\'s saying is, "I\'m going to make everyone pay an extra $1T for infrastructure!" Right? That\'s what he\'s saying.\n\nNever mind that doesn\'t mean the people *using, and benefitting* from the infrastructure are paying for it. That means *everyone* is paying for it, whether or not it benefits them. \n\nIs the same true if you go to the store? Do you have to pay for someone else\'s groceries and clothes or whatever? \n\nOr, in general, do we just buy the things that we want and need, and leave others to buy the things *they* want and need?

aS"It was one of the pillars of Obama's campaign. $200B a year for infratructure. One man can't  change a horribly broken system.

All-in-all not where you want to be if you want to have a serious chance at the White House.'
p2378
aS"And he will continue to. If you thought Obama was blocked by congress you haven't seen anything yet. Sanders is to the Democratic Party what the pre-tea party republicans were to theirs. \n\nSome people may like the way he votes and what he supports, but he's too extreme to connect with the average American, and definitely too extreme to be able to work alongside the republican congress. So much so that if he's elected we might spend another 4 years shoveling snow in a blizzard. \n\nHe's seems like a stand-up guy but he needs to dial back the socialism if he hopes on having any success. \n\nEdit: The reddit circle jerk strikes again. Downvoted for going against the grain, even though I contributed to the discussion. "

p2380
aS"I think you're misunderstanding triviality. Sanders isn't complaining about using social media. He's complaining about when it lacks substance, when you see a one sentence post about Obama ending the world or Ted Cruz saying something stupid in front of a camera. He's arguing for intellectual discussion rather than sensationalist and hollow bullshit that conveys no actual political information to the public and instead just polarizes people and turns politics into TMZ."

aS'What would she hide about her dealings at the State Department?  The levels of conjecture you would need to reach something shady that doesn\'t implicate the Department and the Administration on a whole is quite suspect.  I\'m not in favor of giving anyone the benefit of the doubt here, but I\'ll be outraged when someone finds something more concrete than "maybe this is bad".  \n\nAnd, honestly, you\'re going to promote Sen. Sanders using talking points like these that would make the RNC chairman blush?  You don\'t need to convince me; I\'m voting for Sanders in the primary.  But I\'m also not prepared to shit all over Hillary to help Sanders\' rather dim chances of winning the primary, either.  As a Democrat, if Sanders does not win the primary (and it is rather unlikely he does), I\'m not going to be OK with a smear campaign from within that diminishes Sec. Clinton\'s chances.'

Was why I'm wondering. \n\nOr is she just supposed to take the donation directly from each of the Koch brothers individually, to be less corrupt?\n\nIn case you didn't know who the Koch Bros are:\n\n&gt;US Senator Bernie Sanders asserts that the Koch brothers fund think tank position papers, media pundits and politicians to promote three distorted perceptions: the need to raise the age of retirement, the notion that the social security system is going bankrupt, and the idea that social security should be privatized.\n"
p2385
aS"Exactly. In the grand scheme of things, both O'Malley and Sanders have the same odds right now. . .though if O'Malley can play his cards right and get some following, he'll have more of a chance because he's not as left-wing as Sanders. Hillary's got momentum right now, though, that'll be hard to defeat. All that 'bad press' has served to also put her in the forefront of many people's minds. . .while those same people are still going 'huh? who?' in response to hearing the names Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley."

What would he do? What is his plan. None of us could possibly know from that statement. '
p2389
aS"Sanders is running on the idea that one person can't change this country and if we want real change we will need the majority of Americans demanding it and without a super pac  that is the only way he'll  get elected.\n\n The whole time leading up to Sanders entering the race he kept asking if Americans were ready to take on the billionaire  class.

aS"So how is Sanders going to balance the budget?  What is his stance on our foreign policy?  You can't have a socialist state and endless warfare."
p2393
aS'He supports [less intervention.](http://www.npr.org/2014/11/20/365390926/sen-sanders-weighs-in-on-foreign-policy-issues) I will say that I knew [Sanders](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/bernie-sanders-iran-letter-war-115934.html) seemed less ready for war with Iran. But it also seems that [Paul](http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/rand-paul-challenges-marco-rubio-and-ted-cruz-on-iran/?_r=0) is not nearly as bad as other Republicans on the issue.\n\nSo Sanders would probably spend less money on intervention. Have regulations on big financial groups including breaking up ["too big to fail groups"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Wall_Street_reform). Increasing competition as they are worse than monopolies. And he would [close loopholes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Taxes) for the upper-income-brackets to lower taxes of the lower-income-brackets. I also assume he\'d raise taxes to pay for things like [universal health care](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Health_care).\n\nOn a note unrelated to Sanders: why couldn\'t a socialist state have endless warfare? They\'d certainly be able to fund it.'
p2394
aS'Man, Sanders sure loves to bitch. '
p2395
aS"Washington is a state with a high concentration of liberals, so of course Sanders is going to be more competitive there. Nationally and in the swing states where the contest is fought, he's in the teens... maybe, at best.\n\nBut you're missing the bigger picture on Sanders. Obama bested Romney by about 15 points Washington. Hillary bests her challengers by at least 10 points in the latest poll. Bernie meanwhile is tied or down a couple of points against the GOP. If you're tied in Washington as a Democrat, you've already lost in a landslide."

aS'People in Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina will not turn out to decide who they want to represent them as the Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party until Feb \'16. Bernie (and his supporters) have nine months to birth a challenge to Ms. Clinton. \n\nI think it\'s early to scoff at his chances of being the nominee. Ms. Clinton has the dubious benefit of 25 years in the national public eye. As far as the GOP goes, she might be one of the most-hated figures in human history. I think they\'d rate Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev higher than they\'d rate Hillary Clinton.\n\n25 years of rancor. 25 years of "opposition research". 25 years of (mostly) manufactured scandal. 25 years of noise...an endless barking of very pious walruses. \n\nThat can\'t help but bleed over into the hive mind. I\'m sure that there are plenty of Democrats that have questions about her integrity as a result. \n\nI think it hinders her chances. Honestly, Ms. Clinton and Mr. Sanders aren\'t really all that far apart on social issues or ideals Sen Sanders has a long, consistent legislative history to back him up. He also is hitting exactly the issues that strike home w/ the millenials.\n\nThere is also the long history of actual progressive ideals being completely ignored by the people in DC. That\'s significant amount of pent-up frustration. \n\nI think Ms. Clinton might bear the brunt of some of that. \n\nTL;DR: It\'s early yet. I think it\'s foolish to lend much stock to too much polling beyond "Bernie Who?"'
p2400
aS'&gt;The fact you think words like "treason" or "economic suicide" fit like a glove scares the hell out of me. Trade agreements are an important part in keeping up with the global economy. If we fall behind, it can be disastrous. Trade agreements are a necessity in the emerging markets, and they also help claim resources we need for cheap.\n\nI might consider buying your argument if trade surpluses had resulted from Free Trade.  Tragically, the large and growing trade deficits that have only resulted from Free Trade undermine your argument since they prove that the U.S. has been losing out to Free Trade from the onset.  How is it we both look at a hollowed out U.S. economy and greatly eroded middle class, but see radically different economic results?  That is evidence of a massive economic policy failure from Free Trade, ***not*** success.  Albert Einstein once defined insanity as "doing the same tghing over and over again while expectiung a different result".  Economically speaking, that is precisely what Free Trade has always been in the U.S....economic insanity.\n\n&gt;The one actual complaint I hear about TPP is that trade agreements ships jobs overseas and hurts wages. Even Bernie Sanders agrees with those. It\'s not true.\n\nBernie is right and you are mistaken on this count.  U.S. economic history proves he is right.  Look it up!\n\n&gt;Trade agreements provide opportunities for corporations to expand into other countries. During the month of March this year, car sales by GM and Ford in China almost reached the US sales figures (443,192 vs 485,804). This could not have been done without China and the US lowering tariffs on each other.\n\nYou\'re glossing over the very reason that the U.S. even has trade agreements.  It is ***to benefit this country and its people***, NOT corporate shareholders who do not share their wealth and returns with the vast majority of the American people or country.  Again, U.S. trade deficits undermine your argument entirely on this count.  It should be pointed out that Ford, GM and every other multinational corporation can STILL conduct business in China without Free Trade.  They simply can\'t offshore their manufacturing to China, Mexico or anywhere else and sell back into the very U.S. market, they are hellbent on abandoning, without Free Trade...the real reason Free Trade exists.\n\n&gt;To circumvent high employment cost, we would either have to allow corporations to expand most around the world, increasing revenues and profits, or we have to lower our minimum wage, and other wage expectations.\n\nYou\'re making a purely supply side argument here and a deeply flawed one at that.  Since you brought up the auto industry, who do you suppose would be left to buy overpriced cars without the income to do so if the labor practices you embrace were to worsen as you\'re proposing.  As it stands, consumer demand in the U.S. has plummeted from those labor/pay practices and there are no substitutes anywhere else in the world.\n\nOh, I\'ve heard arguments that global wages will "rise" from globalization.  While they\'ve definitely inched up to the point workers in Mexico and China make about 20% of U.S. workers, they will never reach what U.S. workers once made because U.S. wage levels are falling behind.  Based on the current path, the global wage equilibrium point will end up being much closer to Chinese/Mexican rates than U.S. wage rates/income levels.  How do I know this?  Math...calculate the weighted average global wage rate, weighting by each respective market population.   '
p2401
aS'&gt; That IS what you said. "Because they\'re fundamentally good people. I can see that in their actions.". Knowing about economics or finance isnt the same as knowing about policy and the wide reaches and impacts a policy will make. \n\nSure, but they know more than you or I do.\n\n&gt;Again, you just made up $12. So you dont actually know what the result of that is. You dont see a problem with that? You are supporting the policy, you should know the specifics.......\n\nJust made up? No, I think a reasonable living wage is somewhere between $10 and $15 an hour. If you really want, we can go back to when wages stopped keeping up with inflation and extrapolate from that. It would probably be even higher than $15, though.\n\n&gt;You cant repeal or leglislate out a court ruling\n\nYou can pass new legislation with the same effect.\n\n&gt;Oh its not worth it? How do you know, lets see the math....\n\nLet\'s call it an opinion. Because forcing yourself to stick in the past just to save a few jobs is fucking asinine.\n\n&gt;Capital gains? You mean the same capital gains that joe average has on his small account? \n\nIs average Joe making any sort of appreciable amount, there? \n\n&gt;Inheritance? You mean the tax which anyone competent in estate planning can already get around? \n\nI mentioned closing loopholes, too, didn\'t I? Don\'t fucking ask me which ones in particular.\n\n&gt;The tax which is actually in reality a very small issue in terms of money? Interesting place to start.\n\nIs there a larger source of non-corporate tax I\'m missing?\n\n&gt;What gets to stay what has to leave? What projects stay what projects go? What about commitments to other countries? to the UN? Those are legally binding after all.\n\nUh, the people who usually make those decisions, I presume. \n\n&gt;Based on what analysis and metric are you measuring "need" ?\n\nBased on the fact that we have a military the size of the next 9 or so nations combined and most of what we do is use that to make those who make up the military industrial complex rich.\n\n&gt;You see how you cant even answer the basic questions about policy? yet somehow you think you can solve it all....\n\nGet of your high fucking horse. I never said *I* could personally solve jack shit. I\'ve done more research just answering you than 99% of the population will ever do in a lifetime of voting.\n\nSanders is one of a very small group of honest people in our government and he\'s got a 30 year record to back him up. That alone puts him ahead of anyone else.'
p2402
aS'Sanders doesn\'t want to end too big to fail companies, he just wants to move them from the private sector to the public sector.\n\nIf he really was against too big to fail organizations he wouldn\'t be in favor of monolithic federal social programs, but rather using the federal government to force states to implement these social programs. \n\nWhy have one big healthcare system waiting to fail and bring down the whole economy when you could have 50 different single payer systems? \n\nIt\'s not "too complicated" seeing as the EU has many different single payer systems. \n\nThe left wants to be more like the EU, but wants to elect a guy that has USSR style socialism in mind. It\'s fucking retarded. \n\nWhy not just amend the constitution to say all people have a right to healthcare then use the power of the federal government to force states to do it? When we integrated schools we didn\'t create a federal school system (but a lot of idiots think we did), we just forced states to integrate. \n\nThe DOE is not a "federal school system". About all it does these days is issue grants. The states actually handle all the schooling and curriculum (and this is how every other large developed nation in the world does it, Canada doesn\'t have one school system, the EU is made up of many different schooling systems). \n\nWhat America really needs is to take back control of the states. People act like state governments are meaningless, but the same thing is going to happen to the federal government (and already is happening) if you continue to centralize everything. '

It was either merge, or go bust and while it\'s impossible to say what would really happened if more banks go bust, Lehman was already quite a big mess. Hundreds of banks went bust but those who got brokered into merger were/are really of importance unfortunately.\n\nAs for Hillary, holding someone accountable for what happened 20 to 30 years ago I find rather difficult as well.

Sanders in this might be different, but the average candidates requires hundreds of millions in order to get elected for the program. \n\nFor this I applaud what Sanders wants, at the same time I think it's naive to think that a change in legislation will keep money out of the elections. Mind you both sides are extremely creative when it comes to rolling their own elections."

aS"Obviously, Bernie Sanders lacks the name recognition that Hilary Clinton has.  This greatly affects polls.  Media exposure is what drives name recognition.  There will not be a poll of people equally exposed to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton expressing their preference of the three.  Their poll results correlate to their relative media exposure.  Clinton has had the lion's share, Warren is second place, and Bernie Sanders is in last place, in polls on average, in name recognition and in media exposure, because they are connected phenomena.  \n\nName recognition taints the outcome of every poll.  Picking our candidates by name recognition, what becomes the most important criteria that people consider in evaluating electability, is folly.  Don't take the results of a poll as a snapshot of what policies or what kind of candidate the people actually want.  We still don't really know.  If the media wasn't so biased toward the pro-corporate profits candidates, and against the genuine pro-working class candidates, we'd have more balanced public opinion polls on the possible candidates.  Public opinions can even seem contradictory depending on how questions are worded.  Don't let flawed studies of public opinion sway your perceptions, beliefs, feelings and behaviors.  Don't be fooled into thinking you must always settle for one of the two most media exposed, pro-corporate profits interested, candidates from the only two viable political parties."

aS"* There were several votes.\n* Every single Democrat voted YEA for the USA Freedom act. Even reddit darlings Sanders and Warren. This would have reauthorized bulk collection and expanded collection to VoIP calls and some other stuff. There were (some) safeguards but since Section 215 would have  expired all by itself and for other reasons, the EFF pulled their support.\n* There were other votes, votes to even do a straightforward renewal for just one day. There was no way anyone could later deny these were renewals, and were much less popular. Sanders voted against these.\n\n\nNevertheless, it's a matter of public record that **every single Democrat.** Even Sanders, even Warren, even Wyden (who you might remember from the filibuster), they all fucking voted for a bill that would have renewed Section 215. \n\nNow is the time to call your congress-critters as the vote is coming back around on the 31^st for a last ditch effort and they only need to turn two Republicans. Unless some of those Democrats decide to turn themselves and stand with Rand against the PATRIOT Act. "
p2430
aS'Not at all.  I\'m saying **give me specifics**.  Supporters of every other candidate seem to have no problem showing what their candidate specifically did.

aS"I wish more people would realize this. Sanders has made a number of feel-good, technically-true statements about his campaign that make little sense at best, and are quite misleading.\n\nHe won't start a SuperPAC, it's true, just like *every other candidate won't*, because *it's illegal*, yet he has no choice in whether SuperPACs support him, and there have been SuperPACs that exist to support his campaign since before he announced.\n\nAnd he won't run a negative campaign, except his supporters will do that for him: there are perhaps more Bernie-related anti-Hillary posts on r/politics than there are pro-Sanders ones, and most discussion here and elsewhere online is focused on attacking her. For an example, just look at *this very thread*, with comparisons to her husband, attacks on her experience, and outright misinformation about her funding.\n\nThat so many redditors see Sanders as an idol rather than a typical politician, especially after his AMA, is rather dismaying.\n\n"

Does anybody think this is the kind of economy we should have. Do we think it\'s moral?"\n\nI would make the argument, do we think its optimal - because it isn\'t.  Do we think it enables students to get jobs, because it doesn\'t.  Do we think it enables future entrepreneurship as well as it could, because it won\'t.\n'

aS"&gt;A good example is healthcare. A fiscal conservative would see that a single payer system would far cheaper and probably more effective than the ACA by a large margin.\n\nSo you'd agree that Bernie Sanders is a fiscal conservative?

If i "was" an alien from outter space and I saw that liberal ideals on a billboard, i would have assumed they would be against abortion and recommend having the child and put it up for adoption.\n\nAnd you could add /r/politics hates the patriot act but critisizes rand heavily for his pseudo filibuster while all Sanders has to say is "NSA\'s bad mmkay" via a note press release and its BOOM-done.  Sanders is the man, look at what he does, a great politician.  He has my life.\n\nI think the problem here is /politics and really american liberalism in general.  Its always..

His constituents are from the weirdest state in the union. There are a few small pockets across the country that share the same concerns as Vermont and they are just other versions of la-la land. \n\nYou can't take Asheville North Carolina or Portland Oregon and declare them as a lens to American opinion without debasing your entire view point. And that means you can't take Vermont to use the same way either. Outside of those rare places it is fantasy, pure and simple. Sanders voting record is for all intents and purposes a glitch in a glitch filled system\n\nJust one single aspect alone derails his voting record as anything more than vapor; There are more people in the city of Boston than the entire state of Vermont.\n\nThink about that for a second. One city that can't tie its own shoes without someone getting punched in the taint or knocked up has more people than the entirety of Sanders' constituency... \n\nAnd if you think that sort of disparity has no effect on the outcomes of a candidate in national elections then you are gonna have a sad time every time. \n\nI love my Vermonster neighbors I really do but they are in no way any indicator of American public opinion or reality. And their politicians in the belt way are in no way an indicator of how the system works or can work. \n\nLet Sanders be the message candidate a lot of us would like to see. He will harangue and bully the right questions and expectations into the lime light but as long as you keep pumping this myopic optimism into the campaign it will come off the rails as soon as you realize he has no chance against the juggernauts.

Not only that Obama's community organizing background (particularly in Iowa and the other caucus states), and freaking Oprah one of the most popular women in America at the time campaigning for him in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina are all defining moments on why he won.

aS'Well, the data they show demonstrates that Sanders is ahead of *any* four of the bottom five Republican candidates, but the headline specifies the four lowest.\n\nNow, why is that relevant? Because, as the article states, those four republican candidates get more media attention than Sanders.

Thus, the more popular and better covered Republican candidates aren\'t relevant to the discussion.'

aS'&gt; So are we just to assume that she\'s running on the same platform she ran on eight years ago?\n\nHer platform is available.  There are 4 major points\\*:\n\n * Build the economy ("of tomorrow not yesterday")\n * Strengthening families and communities\n * Protect America from current and future threats\n * Getting unaccountable money out of the political system.\n\nYou guys are talking like this information isn\'t out there.  It is.  It\'s important enough that she made campaign finance reform one of her major planks.\n\nNot that she has any more chance to do something about it than Sanders does (which is about zero).  The most important thing that happens is that Democrats continue to be elected to the White House, and continue to appoint Supreme Court judges.  Thomas and Scalia can\'t live forever, and unfortunately, due to gerrymandering and voter restrictions, the house is out of reach for Democrats until there\'s either a sea change or the courts fix it.  \n\nWhich is why it\'s important to nominate a Democrat that can *win the general election*.  And I hate to be the voice of reason here, but Hilary is polling well ahead of any potential Republican challenger already; whereas Sanders is polling in the "who is that?" zone.  I\'m not in love with Clinton, but she\'s good enough and she can win.

aS'&gt;Look, the issue here is...uh...I was a mayor for eight years, being a cop is a very very difficult job. But the word has got to get out that when police act inappropriately, and of course in this case there has to be a thorough investigation. But for too many years, too many...mostly Black suspects, have been treated terribly and in some cases murdered. That is unacceptable. And police officers have got to be held accountable for their actions.\n\n&gt;Second of all, in the neighborhood where this gentleman lives, as I understand it, the unemployment rate is over 50 percent, over 50 percent. What we have got to do as a nation is understand that we have got to create millions of jobs, to put people back to work, to make sure that kids are in schools, and not in jails.\n\n&gt;So short term, we\'ve got to make sure the police have cameras. We\'ve got to make sure that we got real police reform so that suspects are treated with respect. Long term, we got to make sure that our young people are working, they\'re in schools and not hanging out on street corners.\n\nThat\'s what Sanders said. It sounds true to me.\n\nIm looking forward to seeing an official and comprehensive piece of literature describing the Clinton campaign platform. Brief would even be okay. But I\'d like to have a full picture of what she\'s running on rather than a "glimpse".\n\nMaybe there is just something I don\'t understand.

And of course I would love to see Sanders produce a longer pamphlet in which he could unify and clarify the vision he has for America. He is so vocal, I could never keep up with all of the appearances and minor publications he makes, but he has clear ideals and a coherent message.\n\nYou might be interested in Sanders 14 point economic platform:\n\n Invest in our crumbling infrastructure with a major program to create jobs by rebuilding roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants, airports, railroads and schools.\n\n Transform energy systems away from fossil fuels to create jobs while beginning to reverse global warming and make the planet habitable for future generations.\n\n Develop new economic models to support workers in the United States instead of giving tax breaks to corporations which ship jobs to low-wage countries overseas.\n\n Make it easier for workers to join unions and bargain for higher wages and benefits.\n\n Raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour so no one who works 40 hours a week will live in poverty.\n\n Provide equal pay for women workers who now make 78 percent of what male counterparts make.\n\n \n Reform trade policies that have shuttered more than 60,000 factories and cost more than 4.9 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs.\n\n Make college affordable and provide affordable child care to restore Americas competitive edge compared to other nations.\n\n Break up big banks. The six largest banks now have assets equivalent to 61 percent of our gross domestic product, over $9.8 trillion. They underwrite more than half the mortgages in the country and issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards.\n\n Join the rest of the industrialized world with a Medicare-for-all health care system that provides better care at less cost.\n\n Expand Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and nutrition programs.\n\n Reform the tax code based on wage earners ability to pay and eliminate loopholes that let profitable corporations stash profits overseas and pay no U.S. federal income taxes.\n\n\n"

A guy who is the most prominent socialist in the United States polls higher than four Republicans who are unknown to most people and have ideologies ranging from center-right to right wing (read: they're indistinguishable from each other to most voters). I understand most people don't know who Sanders is either, but he's a lightning rod for the far left, which will boost his support amongst that faction. \n\nThis is a silly thing to poll and even sillier for the Post to write about, but hey, it's hard for them when one of the most-talked about candidates will scarcely give an interview or make a public appearance. \n\nI'm excited for both parties' primaries. I'm anxious to see Hillary Clinton on a debate stage with Sanders and Martin O'Malley. "

aS"Sanders isn't interesting. He's against Hillary, who has the pres locked up until at least the first primaries (just like last time) and common sense when looking at his history says he's not actually a serious candidate, especially with her having so much leverage with the party, he's basically Dennis Kucinich (as a character in the race, not in policy) and just as unelectable in a general. Right now the Democratic primaries aren't interesting.\n\nThe Republicans are interesting because there's no clear front runner so, arguably, it's *far* more important to know what differentiates them and what each persons platform is."

And that since her time in office polarization has pretty much homogenized the Democratic Party to the point where there isn't that much diversity in position anymore, and those positions are far more liberal than they've been in recent history. The Sanders positions you brought up are no different than what all democrats positions are. I'm not saying there's no difference between Sanders and Clinton. Those differences will certainly be aired out in the primaries. But the positions you picked aren't controversial. They are central positions to all democratic candidates.\n\nThe major difference you bring up is financial backing. Which is certainly different, but what they want is the same. Both candidates have made it their primary goal to overturn Citizens United. I mean the whole ruling was so that CU could fund an anti Clinton documentary. The issue is particularly personal to Clinton. And just because Clinton has financial backing from larger donors, doesn't change her position on this issue. The fact is that Clinton is a candidate that has a legitimate chance and Sanders is not. And in America having strong financial backing is what gives you that chance. It's not hypocritical to run on campaign finance reform, and at the same time accept large donations. It's the only way to win under current laws."

(They want roads, they want a good education system, they believe in regulation). However they are only moderately ok with wealth redistribution. They broadly speaking, believe in capitalism. \n\nBernie Sanders doesn't connect with them, Mayscare them, he yells a lot, he is always angry. \n\nClinton on the other hand, is just the type of Democrat they want.

aS'&gt;"The real shame here is that the education is clearly woahfully underfunded for what the nation is getting back in terms of ready to work quality graduates.\n\nI disagree with this part.  We have plenty of work-quality graduates, just that these graduates are understandably incapable of accepting a wage that is 90% less than what their parents made adjusted for inflation.  These graduates are now competing in a globalized labor market that their parents simply did not have to deal with, and laborers in places like China and India are paid a tiny fraction of what our workers are paid to do similar, if not the exact same, work.\n\nBernie Sanders understands this well, indeed he is very eloquent in making this case, and I respect him for that.  What I don\'t see from him however is a viable solution, one that would not outright destroy the American economy in the process.  What I see from Sanders is massive amounts of protectionism, prohibitive tax policy, and just about every single leftist trick in the book you can think of to scare capital into submission.  Well, that\'s kind of the problem...capital won\'t submit, it\'ll just move elsewhere.  And, when capital moves, wealth moves with it.  We would become very poor, and eventually we\'d become the ones working for 90% less than other countries.'

aS"Well a lot of the entitlement spending everyone is so worried about could be more effectively controlled with social polices. I totally get where you are coming from, but the point is that the rules have to be rewritten, and by the I don't just mean laws, but rather the whole damn system. None of this is sustainable, not without massive shift in human thinking in both social and economic mindsets. What I do know is that we as humans have played this game out many of times, and you either fix it, or the pitch forks come out. Globalization is a huge threat, but we can delay that fight to some extent, yes with protection based policies. I mean how else do you do it? You seem to be smarter than most that post here, but I think you would admit that none of this is sustainable so I'd love to hear what you think we should be doing vs what Mr Sanders is suggesting. To me both sides of the isle are running towards a zero sum end game. Healthcare is a major factor in all of this, but we can't even get that right because 1/2 of the population seems to think that there is nothing that can be done. Just keep it privatized  and everything will be ok.. but it wasn't and turns out we spend on avg way more than the rest of the industrialized world on this huge part. Does that not come into these spending equations.. aka how much we could save if we did it correctly vs what we have now? That would drop all 3 major entitlement expenditures dramatically.. but again we can't even get that done because.. well honestly its because profit from that industry is more important that our long term survivability as nation. Personally I think that is insane, this is a fixable problem, but not if we continue to box ourselves in with this it can't be done thinking. We've done things like Bernie is suggesting before... and we did quite well during those times. I just don't buy the arguments I'm seeing on here so I'd love to her more specifics on what you think the answer or is slowly choking on own petrified stances how this is all going to play out. \n"

aS'&gt;"I totally get where you are coming from, but the point is that the rules have to be rewritten, and by the I don\'t just mean laws, but rather the whole damn system. None of this is sustainable, not without massive shift in human thinking in both social and economic mindsets.\n\nIt\'s IMHO actually quite sustainable and what I described is a short term problem that will smooth out in the long term.  Unfortunately, this is an issue where a short term problem can be acutely painful for us, and where the long term outcome, while good for more people, is not necessarily good for us.  The question is are we willing to bear this short term pain while the rest of the world\'s wage levels rise to our level, and poverty levels diminish? (this is all basic economic theory, i.e. perfect competition leading all to an equilibrium point) Do we have a reason to do this, when no one is going to thank us for it?  In fact, more than likely, when other countries become just as wealthy as us, they\'ll also be able to field a military just as potent as ours.  Is that in our interests?\n\nThese questions are very difficult to answer.  IMHO there is no good solution, only "less bad" ones.  Recommend reading realpolitik literature to get an understanding of this kind of problem, although I\'ll warn you that realpolitik is chock-full of "less bad" solutions, and little to nothing that would make you feel good about politics in general.  The thing is, IMHO realpolitik asks the right questions, and asking those questions are the first step towards getting a viable solution, even if that solution is morally ambiguous at best.  A viable solution is better than a pipe dream.\n\n&gt;"profit from that industry is more important that our long term survivability as nation.\n\nYeah, you\'ve described another economic dilemma, i.e. private vs public good.  Private actors tend to ignore public good, and when that happens you get market failures that the private sector cannot correct.  You\'re right, if those failures remain uncorrected then the whole system goes to shit.  The thing is though, Bernie Sander\'s solution seems to be to nuke the private sector and turn it all public.  That brings with it a completely different set of problems.\n\n&gt;"We\'ve done things like Bernie is suggesting before... and we did quite well during those times. \n\nSo, I suppose what you want at this point is an explanation as those problems will be.  I believe "deadweight loss" is the applicable concept.  The idea is that what Bernie Sanders is suggesting is that we grant the government sweeping powers to dictate economic activity.  The government simply is not capable of determining optimal price levels in the economy...only a market where people can actually express their economic preferences can determine that optimal price level.  This means that the government will miss, and in Mao\'s case, the miss was gigantic...20 million people died of famine because he missed on food projections while he controlled the economy.  He wasn\'t a "monster" or "evil" or anything like that...he just did not know how to run a food business for all of China.  He made mistakes, and people starved.  \n\nWhat if our government made mistakes when given this much autonomy?  '

aS"Yes, it's definitely a problem. Even during the last election, the GOP also had a very difficult time rallying together to support Romney which is one big reason he lost. There is no marketable brand for the GOP--it's a bit of a three ring circus.\n\nI would not be surprised if we have a number of independent candidates running for President this time. Certainly from within the Republican Party I can see at least couple of candidates. Rand Paul could easily distance himself from this broken brand with Bush or Graham the established candidate. \n\nAnd even from within the Democratic Party, I can see Bernie Sanders running as an independent with Hillary the established candidate. \n\nAll of this is possible because it is not the party machine that moves an election, it's big money. Get enough dollars from a few people and you can try to buy yourself the election. "

aS"Great speech on economic inequality, which is an incredibly important issue.\n\nBut he fails to mention: criminal justice reform, immigration reform, reproductive rights, or LGBT rights.

The media really wants it to appear that these two are really sticking it to each other don\'t they. I guess if there isn\'t any drama, better make it up.\n\nOn another note, I would absolutely love it if this country had $15 minimum wage, and free college education for all.'

aS"...And while I support free (or government-subsidized) secondary education, this is exactly why Bernie Sanders won't be taken seriously as a presidential candidate.\n\nThe general consensus is that people need to *earn* what they have, not be given what they have.

How should those be curbed?\n\nAlso, these questions themselves are completely opaque.  What do you define as High frequency trading?  What in the world is a Global Robin Hood Tax?  Are either of those things ACTUALLY addressed by the Bernie Sanders proposed bill?\n\nYes/No ansers are stupid.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\n"Robin hood taxes" (A term which implies taxes that are meant to take only from the extremely wealthy and give to the extremely poor) sound nice on papaer, but this particular bill ABSOLUTELY affects more than just the extremely wealthy.  \n\nI, am NOT an extremely wealthy person.  I currently have something like $10,000 in my retirement account right now.  That retirement fund is located in ETF, whch by their very nature, make frequent, predictable, and planned out trades in order to maximize their return.\n\nWithout adding another dollar to my retirement account, due to compund interest, the measly 10k that I have in my retirement account stands to grow to something along the lines of $400,000 by the time i retire.  Now, obviously, I plan on continuing to contribute to that fund, but lets just put that aside for a moment.\n\na half percent fee on EVERY TRADE for a high-trading-volume ETF like the one that I hold could be potentially DEVASTATING to my retirement fund.  Since I plan on my fund being worth at least 1 million dollars by the time i retire (but hopefully more), I stand to loose HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of dollars from this tax, just from silly back of the napkin math.\n\nNow, with the back of the napkin math out of the way, it simply raises red flags, and I get to investigate it further  I havn\'t come to a final conclusion yet, but the blanket statements you make in your comments completely undermine the actual thought that goes into making choices like this.\n\nAm I against High Frequency Trading?  I don\'t know exactly what you mean by it, my I, and probably your parents, own shares in ETF\'s that trande massive volumes of shares on a daily basis.  It is literally their job to make *me*, an average joe, money by doing that.  Am I the target of this Robin hood tax?  Am I participating in High frequency trading?  You tell me, you apparently are an expert on the subject.  '

p2526
aS'It\'s not a past problem.  It\'s a present problem.  And it\'s one that affects *voting* Americans.  \n\nI am looking at this both from an economic and a political lens.  You can\'t propose the most radical (and needed!) overhaul to our education in a hundred years, and leave out so many.  We\'ve already got tens of millions of people who are not economically active despite solid incomes because they are so busy servicing debt.  You can fix the cause of the problem but that doesn\'t unscrew the economy until you actually repair the damage.\n\nYou especially can\'t do it when the people getting left out are the ones you want to vote for you.  They want help.  If you tell them "Vote for me and I will not help you but will help people younger than you" their response is most likely to either vote for hillary or just not vote at all.  \n\nSanders is trying to be the next candidate who is thrilling to youth, but what he\'s promising is exciting to a generation of people who mostly won\'t be old enough to vote for him when he needs them.  If he expands it to student loans he raises the age of benefit from everyone about to go to college/just starting out to everyone who hasn\'t completely paid off their loans yet, which is to say *everyone*.'

aS"&gt;Bernie talks about a 'political revolution' which is just a dramatic way of saying 'we need people, especially young people who tend to be most apathetic, to take an interest and active involvement in politics beyond just voting every few years.' \n\nAnd? Every politician wants young people involved on their side. This is a meaningless fluff statement. Not a deep insightful one. \n\n&gt;Introducing legislation like this is a good way of generating interest in politics. People can see how it can effect them, it's new and interesting idea, it sparks debate, and motivates people to contact their representatives to tell them how they feel about it.\n\nIt's not a new or interesting idea. I've heard it floated around since the 90s at least. It's a campaign stunt, nothing more. \n\n&gt;Repealing Obamacare 40 times isn't really generating any interest in politics or generating any debate. After the first 20+ times people stop paying attention, so no new interest. \n\nI can tell you aren't conservative in a conservative area. It the exact same thing. Just because you don't care doesn't mean it doesn't energize or fire up interest among others.\n\nThey're the same thing. If you've been raining against Republicans wasting time and money trying to campaign by introducing bills that go nowhere. Be annoyed at this. Surprise, Sanders is just a career politician like the rest."

aS"That doesn't mean it would have passed if Sanders were president.  There wasn't enough support in Congress from the Democrats to pass a public option.  The entire bill was passed without any Republican voting yes on it with, in all fairness, a pretty underhanded procedure.  That isn't how you negotiate either.  That's neither here nor there I guess but having a more liberal president would not have changed the outcome.  Plus, I would consider Obama a better politician in terms of politicking than Sanders, which is probably why Sanders is more liked by liberals. "

aS'This is a classic example of the *ceteris paribus* fallacy. Sanders puts forward legislation based on current trading patterns to pay for college assuming that all else will be held constant. Clearly legislation such as this would drastically cut down the amount of trades on the street.

In a very, very short amount of time, that "pocket change" is going to become a prohibitive burden on your ability to leave your house.'
p2537
aS"Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't there a lot of loopholes during the 90% era which meant most weren't paying that, even on the margins?  \n\nRegardless, I agree with Bernie Sanders assessment that higher taxes on the wealthy are needed.  The government obviously needs the revenue, as we run a deficits despite offering inferior services than most Western European countries.  A simple look at the wealth distribution in this country also indicates the wealthy are taking more than their share of the income pie.  Corrective action is needed."

The purpose of this bill is **not** to become law, but to show that Sanders is serious about his commitments to help average Americans rather than the billionaire class.\n\nThat doesn\'t mean the bill is meaningless, of course. Sanders is sending a signal to supporters that he\'s not joking around, but he\'s also telling Wall Street that he\'s serious about leveling the field. He\'s essentially snubbing those who have the most to contribute to his campaign, which is a bold move.\n\nWhat I\'m not clear about in this particular bill is whether it would tax **every** transaction on Wall Street. That would essentially kill high-frequency trading. Long-term traders might love that idea, but it would probably result in a serious lack of liquidity in the stock market. It\'s hard to predict the impact, but I\'d feel pretty confident predicting "unforeseen negative consequences."\n\nThen again, I\'m probably overthinking it, because the "proposed bill" is more of a statement than proposed legislation.'

Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent.\n&gt; \n&gt; HARWOOD: When you think about 90 percent, you don\'t think that\'s obviously too high?\n\n&gt; SANDERS: No. That\'s not 90 percent of your income, you know? That\'s the marginal. I\'m sure you have some really right-wing nut types, but I\'m not sure that every very wealthy person feels that it\'s the worst thing in the world for them to pay more in taxes, to be honest with you. I think you\'ve got a lot of millionaires saying, "You know what? I\'ve made a whole lot of money. I don\'t want to see kids go hungry in America. Yeah, I\'ll pay my fair share."'

aS'&gt; Why are people listening to this bullshit?\n\nAd hominem, loaded question\n\n&gt; If the government funded universities it would lower salaries and the quality of the education would diminish to the point where it\'s barely any different or better than public school\n\nDivision, or false cause\n\n&gt; Use your heads reddit...\n\nSimply patronizing, and tacky.\n\n&gt; Don\'t buy into this socialist bullshit.\n\nGenetic, ad hominem\n\n&gt; If America was supposed to be like everyone else than we would govern like everyone else.\n\nBegging the question\n\nNow that we\'ve identified the problems, it\'s time to construct a response.\n\nPeople listen to stories like this because our contemporary public discourse follows a pattern of political announcements followed by media and then public reactions.  The audience is expecting political grandstanding, the media is happy to portray political grandstanding, and Sanders is running for President, so he should be expected to do some political grandstanding.\n\nThe government funds our military, but the quality of our Armed Forces has not diminished to the point where they\'re barely any different or better than any other organized military force.  In fact, one might argue that the government-run US Armed Forces are the best-performing and most organized military force in the world.  Government funding does not destroy the things it funds.\n\nWhen you address \'reddit\' from a comment thread on reddit, you\'re addressing yourself.  By commenting, you imply that you\'ve used your head to construct a comment, but then you admonish yourself to use your head.\n\nWhether or not Sanders\' proposal is socialist, which depends greatly on your definition of socialism, characterizing it as "bullshit" either means that you view all political grandstanding this way (which incites one to wonder why you\'re in a forum for political discussion), or that your understanding of socialism warrants a particularly derogatory tone of address towards the policy.  Either way, the comment is not substantive, and merely highlights your own thoughtless bias.\n\nFinally... and this bit really takes the cake for me... how do you know what America is *supposed* to be?  Whose intention does this follow, and why is their intention more important than the results of our elections?'

Gates recently said something pretty interesting, it's not much of an issue if someone is a multi millionaire/billionaire, the problem is more what he doesn't do with his money. Does he invest it in for example research or does he blow it on expensive cars. The first is something we should applaud yet by taxing the superrich you basically cut everyone even those with good intentions like Gates himself from their income. \n\nAlso the examples that previously the tax rate has been high, that's right but that was during war when money was needed.

I also feel that limiting the amount of students by their academic prowess would keep the labor markets from being flooded by masters degrees.\n\nBut the incentive is the other way, this is in essence free money for colleges, take people and then if they fail out they fail out. Still making money. \n\nAnd how do you determine legitimate qualifications, that's what we have in theory now. Unless you want to impose a system like foreign systems that really locks down who can go. But we'd never stand for that.\n\n&gt;However I'm unsure that tuition inflation would continue to be a major problem.

aS"Well there is some merit in looking and appearing presidential. I'm not saying Sanders doesn't already fit this, but Ron Paul had a hard time being taken seriously in part because of things like his ill-fitted suits, and inability to give sound bite type speeches.

I too believe it is silly, but in this day and age, it matters for some reason to people.  "

aS'That is a good point that I had not thought about.\n\nAs an aside, this is why I use target date funds, no need to re-balance, the fund does it for you. Also, re-balancing quarterly seems a bit overbearing, do you really find that you need to do it that often?\n\nEdit: And what do you currently pay in transaction fees? What about management fees? I\'m genuinely curious how the proposed fee compares to what you are already paying. If you are a low fee hunter like myself (and I am assuming you are, since you linked to bogleheads, I can understand how the 0.5% fee seems high.) I wonder if the proposed fee would be applicable to funds held in tax sheltered accounts.\n\nEdit 2: Sanders said that the fee would apply to "large stock transactions," so this conversation may be moot. Not sure about you, but on the rare occasions that I do re-balance, it is never more than a few thousand. Seems like this fee may not be remotely applicable to the average "Main Street" investor.'

aS"It's irrelevant because that's not what Bernie Sanders said. He simply reminded us all that at one point the rate was 90%..and no one is asking anything close to that.

It's a union of ideas and an ability to find middle ground. This is strengthened by the idea that anyone who works hard can get ahead. Value isn't inherent, it's earned or built. Sanders is an extremist. He is the Ron Paul of the left, and in America we work together to find the solution. He's a divisive radical and you have too much free time. Any point can be classified using logical fallacies. Most of us don't have time to categorize each other's posts and waste time pointing out that sentences can only be worded in so many ways."
p2559
aS"So basically Sanders is either ignorant or being deceptive. 90% was the highest *nominal* marginal tax rate, but no one ever paid anywhere near a 90% *effective* marginal tax rate because there were far more loopholes than there are today. It's extremely dishonest to compare the nominal rates from that time period with the nominal tax rates of today, given how different the tax code was. The honest thing to do would be to compare the highest effective marginal tax rates between then and today, which are much, much closer than the highest nominal marginal tax rates of then and today."
p2560
aS'"Taxing the rich" is only an unfair or bad thing in this case if the current tax system is 100% fair and balanced. I suspect the reason Bernie Sanders suggested that particular source for taxation is that it\'s currently not taxed at all, and it\'s a bit unfair.\n\nThat is, the average American is already getting the 5% lower salary, because they are paying the burden of certain rich individuals and corporations that use loopholes to essentially pay no tax at all.'

The "often-talked-about" refers to often talked about by the media. But in order to make that connection, you need to have read the beginning of the article.'
p2562
aS'Yeah, I don\'t disagree with you, for the most part.  \n\nLet me point out, though, that both Sanders and Clinton have voting records to look at - however, Sanders is still in office, and Clinton is not.  That\'s an advantage in being able to say "[...] the voting record to back it up".  You could conversely say that Clinton "has a policy initiative record to back it up", referring to her time as Secretary of State.  You could also look at her voting record as a New York senator from 10 years ago.  Saying she has no prior record to infer positions from is incorrect.\n\nIn addition, Sanders is laying out his positions early, because he knows that the farthest he\'s going to get is the debates and the Democratic primary.  His time is much more limited than Clinton\'s, so he\'s A.) trying to get his platform out early, and B.) trying to differentiate from Clinton.  Clinton, on the other hand, can afford to play a longer, better orchestrated campaign.  Sanders is turning a necessity (getting issues out early) into a talking point ("why isn\'t my opponent getting their issues out early?"), but that\'s clever marketing - making lemonade from lemons.\n\nAnd make no mistake about it: Sanders has no chance.  He is running to make sure that the issues are discussed - and it\'s a good thing, because his issues need discussion.  But it\'s an issues-play, it\'s not a serious threat to the White House.  Clinton, though, is a brilliant debater.  She has all of the strong money sources on the Democratic side locked up.  She has some of the best political minds in the country running her campaign.  And she\'s nationally and internationally known, thoroughly experienced, and well liked.  '
p2563
aS'&gt;Wall Street is identified as a clear area where people are profiting hand over fist and rarely pay what many would consider a "fair share".\n\nBut is this true? I don\'t know that it is. I know that the OVERWHELMING majority of so-called Wall Street transactions - the ones Sanders seeks to tax - are not individual people\'s stock portfolios but are in fact investment accounts from groups and companies. These include things like 401k and 403b, not to mention college 529 plans. These accounts are almost exclusively used by the middle class.'

aS'Thanks for the corrections. That is all true. Although, I disagree about Bernie not having a chance.\n\nI feel like the only people who *really* want Hillary are the media (because they love a good Clinton headline), and the Dem/Rep political machines (because she is so "electable/centrist, or because their entire playbook is anti-Hillary). Otherwise, she is pretty right wing and I don\'t know a single person (and I have a wide variety of friends) who are actually into her.\n\nBernie doesn\'t have Dem support (yet), and they will fight it. However, he does have many advantages: a record that backs his platform, and a platform most people, especially young people, agree with. He also appeals across parties (all my evidence is anecdotal on that though). He seems to be the only candidate that actually wants what the public wants. In a year where the republican candidate is almost guaranteed to be weak on issues, he is definitely electable. In terms of debating, I think it will be interesting. Clinton is good, but Bernie is pretty direct and knows his facts. I have been impressed by his every appearance. Clinton, never. And lets not forget if elected, the presidential line from 1989 onwards will look like this: Bush, Bush, Clinton, Clinton, Bush, Bush, Obama..Clinton. Doesn\'t sound very democratic, and I am sure everyone is waiting to bring it up. The only thing Bernie is missing is money. He\'s got everything else.\n\nIMO he only has no chance if the public doesn\'t help him and we let the media and Dem machine define him. As a democrat and liberal, I have zero interest in Hillary. Zip. She has never done anything of note for us. She voted for Iraq when it was CLEARLY the wrong thing to do. She supports TPP. She\'ll probably be the same as Obama if elected. She has big money donors, and she works with and runs with that group. If elected, she is not going to do anything to fix the problems this country faces. \n\nEven if he is not electable I am supporting Sanders till the last day of his campaign because he actually has a lot of the same views I do and will say them on TV, unlike other politicians. \n\nIts a shame when the race is between someone unelectable/disastrous for the country and a fake liberal like it has been the last few times. Time to get some real juice in the game.\n\n[his polls now can be improved with support] (http://utahdatapoints.com/abrown/utahdatapoints/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2008-dem-primary1.png)'

aS'I have a feeling Bernie Sanders is going to royally fuck upper-middle class families that earn in the $150k-500k range.

aS"&gt;Why not, exactly? Any society I want to be a part of has a role for art historians, too. Of course, if too many people major in art history, then those people still face the risk of not finding a job in their chosen career. Obviously that's a natural deterrent that would still be present if higher education were provided by society.\n\nI don't think the government should subsidize education for jobs that are not in demand. That doesn't mean that you can't receive federal or student loan aid to make that choice, but you should bear the risk for your choice, not the federal government. The point of subsidizing degrees for jobs in demand is to curb behavior and to convince people to study nursing instead of art history. If someone is very passionate about art history and thinks that is their calling, they are more than willing to pursue that, but taxpayers shouldn't pay for that risk. In my opinion, subsidizing education should be an investment in expanding the tax base, not a free pass to do whatever you want.\n\n&gt;Of course not, who said otherwise?\n\nLots of people! Why do you think Sanders is trying to make college/university free? So that as many people as possible can attend. Other coutnries have free secondary education, but they also weed out students who aren't cut out for it.\n\n&gt;But it sounds like you didn't get the primary point of your liberal arts education, which was to teach you not just what to think, but how to think. Plenty of art history majors go on to have rewarding careers in other fields.\n\nTrust me, I completely understand that. But unfortunately I think the value of a liberal arts education doesn't mean much to everyone. Lots of smaller state ran schools, no offense, don't have very competent programs.\n\n"

aS'And the stuff they say.  Honestly when I read about a politician saying something crazy, outlandish or obscene, I instantly default to "it was a Republican".  Very rarely, and I mean it\'s happened like once, but one time I remember a Democrat saying something meant to come out of a Republicans mouth and just instantly losing respect for them.  See, when Democrats say something stupid, outlandish or offensive, we all cringe and collectively feel badly for the party and the individuals hurt by their hate speech.  But it seems like when Republicans say this, they have some voting base that rallies against them to spew this hate speech.  It sickens me that people can\'t love their fellow man/woman and do anything possible to ensure we all have a good life to live.  But it mainly seems like this view is elusively Democratic lately.  Try suggesting a socialist idea like Bernie Sanders throws out at a conservative rally, and you\'ll be laughed out of there.  Forget the fact that conservative states are the overwhelming recipients of social welfare projects, they are always trying to cut these programs which is guaranteed to hurt their own people.  When Republicans begin to care about their own people instead of their party, maybe they will have a chance.  I can only hope that in 20 years when the Republican voting base is long dead, they will go the way of the Whigs.  Republicans are destined to become a dead political party.'

But that\'s not how the real world works.\n\nIf we want more money for education and our crumbling infrastructure, we have to overhaul the tax code, prevent companies from using offshore accounts to abuse the current loopholes, and drastically reduce the bloated overweight leadbelly that is the Pentagon budget.\n\nRaising the personal income tax rate does nothing without other adjustments to the United States Code.  If Bernie Sanders is actually serious about running for President, he needs to shut up about 90 percent tax rates.  It\'s political suicide because almost nobody supports that.  Nobody remembers Walter Mondale because he said exactly the same thing.'

The corporations and uber rich "vote" first by giving their dollars to candidates and funding campaigns.  Then, you have a "general" election where you cast your vote for the people who have run their campaigns.

So, let's do some math.\n\nIf you compound quarterly, and invest $100,000, at 5%, without adding to it, after 30 years, you will have $444,021.32.  \n\nWith the same variables, if you invest $100,000 - but at 3% because 2% annually is eaten by your quarterly rebalancing, after 30 years, you will have $245,135.71.\n\nOr, say you're aiming for a higher return of 8%.

But she brings nothing really new to the table. Her politics, to me, are center-right. She is a competent stateswomen. And her foreign policy chops mean little to me because she voted for the Iraq War which was clearly at the time a terrible idea; but it was popular, so she voted for it. \n\nI\'d rather try and get the right person elected and fall back on Clinton if needed.  Sanders is quite electable, IMO, for the reasons I listed earlier.  I do believe the President can do something to fix the problems the country faces and can change the political climate.\n\nHer planks mean nothing to me because they are not specific and she has done nothing about them. Her plank discusses income inequality but she\'s not doing much to stop TPP. She also wants to get money out of politics, but "maybe would consider" repealing Citizens United. The difference between Bernie and Hillary is one candidate has done something about their beliefs and plans to do something further, so I actually believe them. Meanwhile, Hillary isn\'t doing anything about her planks right now, and she is Secretary of State running for office. She may talk a good game during the primaries, but when elected, it won\'t stick.\n\nI was following the last primary season. Clinton did not wow me even during debates, although she is proficient.

They don\'t want to do the hard work of fighting them for the right thing for the people.\n\nI\'m in my mid 30s, interested in politics but not overly active, and I\'m pretty tired of watching America go down the wrong path since 9/11.\n\nIll be watching this year quite closely, and participating/promoting because there is finally a candidate that is worth believing in. \n\nA vote for Sanders is not a vote for Scalia, its a vote to end Citizens united because thats a litmus test for a justice he would recommend. Clinton has no such guarantee. I don\'t exactly get the sense she cares very much about it at all.\n\nSanders is electable, but thats not to say he will make it; he\'s got a lot of opposition.

Because they don't make over a million dollars a year in wages and salaries.   Not most of them.\n\nMost of them make money in dividends and stock options. That's still taxed at a flat, what? 15%?

aS'It seems like you are confusing political platform with values and opinion. A politician could hold the opinion that modern America has failed and plan to change that by implementing policy that will decrease income inequality through tax reform. Likewise another politician may think that modern America is succeeding in achieving the tenenants it was founded on, but still believe that it could do better through policy changes that decrease income inequality through tax reform. At the end of the day, their political platform is the same. The policy they plan to enact is the same. The image you provided shows that Sanders can be a little more hostile and aggressive towards what he sees is wrong, but what he plans to do about it, ie "decrease income inequality, strengthen the middle class, and decrease the influence of the billionaire class" is the exact same thing that Clinton plans to do. And it\'s not like Clinton doesn\'t see these issues as important. They are literally the primary issues she is running on.\n\nAgain I\'m not even remotely trying to say that Sanders and Clinton are the same. And I\'m not even trying to say that their platform is the exact same. All I am saying is that the central aspects to Sanders platform that he has already announced are the exact same central aspects of Clintons platform. I\'m sure when the debates start, the differences between actual policy between the two will be quite apparent. But right now, in terms of actual concrete and comprehensive plans that the two have presented. They\'re the fucking same. So that\'s why I say you are dishonest in your criticism of Clinton but your approval of Sanders. You call her out for not being comprehensive in her plans, and yet don\'t care that the only policy plans Sanders has established are plans that could have come from any democrat contender.'

aS'Well first some of those have absolutely no supporting evidence. I mean claiming that Clinton is not a tax and spend democrat is absurd. She has consistently been on the more liberal side of spending from her time in Congress to pretty much all statements she has made to the press.\n\nAnd then as for Healthcare, I mean for god sakes single payer used to be referred to as "HillaryCare". It was widely considered that her biggest failure as First Lady was not getting anyone on board the single payer train that she worked hard for.\n\nAnd then the other comments made in that post aren\'t actual policy but just opinion, which you continue to get confused. Just because Clinton accepts donations from wealthy donors, doesn\'t mean she isn\'t working for policy that decrease their influence. The only difference between Clinton and Sanders is that Clinton actually stands a chance. And that chance only exists because she accepts donations from wealthy donors. Because she understands the problems she is campaigning on. She understands that the political system is broken and that the only way to turn back citizens United (a ruling made in favor of a corporate sponsored propaganda film against her... The same corporate funding that continues to tarnish her reputation...) is to accept donations that will allow her to actually win. I mean sure it\'s noble that Sanders tries to run a campaign without accepting huge donations, but the reality is you can\'t win like that in America. I mean that\'s the whole fucking point. You are literally sitting here complaining about Clinton doing the only thing that will allow us to change these campaign finance laws... You sit here complaining that the system is broken and that wealthy donors have games the system, and yet somehow you think that doesn\'t apply when it comes to trying to stop those donors from gaming the system... You criticize Clinton for playing the game... for doing the only thing that could possibly lead to more democrats in the Supreme Court... '

p2624
aS'Well, in this case, like many of his other ideas, he actually has no plans, and is only rhetoric.\n\nHowever, we can actually look at some of his other plans to "tax the rich" to see who he thinks the rich are. Back in February, he [proposed expanding the SS tax](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-on-congress-to-strengthen-and-expand-social-security), which would subject the top 9% of wage earners (anyone earning between 118k to 250k, to the same SS taxes as 1% salaries. So, his plans do effect many more people than the super rich. That plan actually creates a huge barrier to anyone in that salary range to move up.\n\nAlso, this current plan is only about taxing income. Most rich people don\'t make high incomes, any most of their wealth comes from investments. This plan would disproportionally effect people who earn money, rather than the mega rich 1%, who in effect, have compensation other than in the form of income.\n\nSo yes, if you have a business that makes, let\'s say 250k, which is not a lot for a small business, and are not a corporation, you are effected more than say a CEO that makes $16 million in the form of stock options, and other non income forms of compensation.\n\nYou should know that we have a progressive tax system in this country, and has been ruled by SCOTUS numerous times, that it\'s only allowed if the rates were fairly applied across the board to income brackets. Meaning, you can\'t unfairly target one bracket for higher rates, without raising the rates on the other brackets. This has been upheld several times as only being constitutional, when the Uniformity Clause isn\'t violated. Which means you can\'t specifically target one group of people for higher taxes, and raising the top bracket, would also raise every other bracket, for it to hold up to any legal scrutiny.\n\nSo, if you raise the tax brackets up for the top 1% of earners, which is ~300k, that means that the next few brackets would also raise sharply. If you look at the tax bracket history in the 40\'s and 50\'s, which is when Sanders wants to take us back to, you would see that there were 20-30 brackets, and even being in a medium income would still be above our upper tax bracket today. A top 10% wage earner in the 50\'s would be around 70k a year, which would be a 80% tax when the highest tax was 90%.\n\nIn order for his plan to survive any legal challenges, taxes would have to be uniformly applied across the board. Generally this has been done by putting the median income as the middle bracket, and going from there. So, in order for you to get a 90% top bracket, that means that the tax bracket for anyone making the median income (which is about 45k), would be subject from anywhere between a 40%-50%, which is more than double what the group is paying now.\n\nWhile Sanders\' war on the rich is a noble cause, he forgets that we are equals in this country, and you can\'t fairly target specific groups, without targeting all groups. This means that his tax on the rich, means more taxes across the board, and would disproportionally effect wage earners, rather than the super rich that can afford the tax, or can afford other forms of compensation, rather than worrying about paying for the mortgage.'

This is fine... Until you realize that the vast majority of savings for the middle class are in popular stock indexes with low (but safe) returns. The elderly who saved for retirement will be the most penalized due to the direct effect the tax would have on their returns. \n\nI could go on, but you get the idea.

Clinton was [one of the most liberal](http://m.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate) members of the Senate during her time there.

Congressional democrats are currently more liberal than they've been in 100 years. That's not speculation. That's data. \n\nThe problem isn't that democrats have been pulled right, it's political polarization. And more liberal democrats doesn't really solve that problem, but actually only makes it worse. While Clinton and Sanders are not all that different in terms of the actual policy they advocate, Clinton is far better at presenting her ideas in a way that hit a cord with the average American voter (thus the historically high approval rating and polling high for democrat voters).

aS'Hardly exactly like ours.   They prioritize the national safety net for all their citizens and work to balance out the inequalities inherent in capitalism.   This is the same kind of socialism that Bernie Sanders is calling for, and as a European, this is what we know as socialism.   '
p2653
aS'I think you\'re proving the previous poster\'s point.\n\nBernie Sanders wants universal healthcare, a higher minimum wage, better environmental regulation, and free education at public universities.  In most of the world, that would get a resounding "meh, sounds about right."\n\nBernie Sanders does not want to nationalize the energy industry, expropriate real estate from landlords, introduce the Labor Theory of Value, or turn over the means of production to the workers.  \n\nBernie Sanders doesn\'t encourage [taking food from grocery stores without paying if you\'re hungry](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/15/us-spain-protests-idUSBRE87E08S20120815).  He doesn\'t encourage [arming the working class to overthrow capital](http://www.readingfromtheleft.com/PDF/CubaSlee2.pdf) (PDF).\n\nIf you believe that Bernie Sanders is "far left," your political spectrum is either very, very narrow or shifted way to the right.  Bernie is a liberal capitalist, a social democrat, a left-moderate on the world stage.  He\'s George McGovern, not Marx or Proudhon or Castro or Chavez.'

aS'Education isn\'t an inherent human right.  "Human rights" are things that the individual is entitled to - but do not include things that must be taken from others.\n\nIf a human right is something that must be taken from another - it would violate the rights of the person being taken from, and therefore is not valid.\n\nPaul is speaking to this definition of Human Rights.  If you are saying someone has the "right" to healthcare, you are saying they have the right to force another to provide them with services.\n\nForcing another person\'s labor *is* slavery.  Forcing people to give you what they own *is* theft.\n\nThat said, the disagreement with Paul and Sanders was a bit of semantics, as Sanders was discussing things on a practical level, while Paul was discussing it more on the philosophical level.\n\n'
p2656
aS"He trolls all over this post. \n\nI mentioned Sanders doesn't understand tax code well enough to reform it and he asked why I didn't think Sanders understood economics and asked for proof. \n\nHe's a troll, another user thought his trolling was so misdirected and out of context that he might be a bot. \n\n\n"

aS"Paul is [changing his tune now that he's running for President](http://time.com/3759378/rand-paul-defense-spending/). He won't be the isolationist his long-time supporters expect him to be. He can't win in the GOP that way at all and can't be expected to govern that way. Sanders *can* win with Democrats as a candidate more isolationist than his opponents within the party. And the general public is more isolationist than the beltway common wisdom believes. Sanders can win the general as well. "

You say "exactly like ours", but then "As a European". It doesn\'t matter, having a safety net does meet the definition of Socialism. And we (Americans) have safety nets, government welfare, government education, government health care just like all of those counties mentioned.\n\n And frankly, that is *not* what Sanders is calling for... he is calling for select people getting free college contingent on stealing from the rich in the stock market. That is *not* what the Europeans have.\n\n He has not proposed single payer health care.\n\n If he were proposing what the northern European countries have, I actually would support him.'

aS'Honestly, do you really see Old White Socialist Bernie Sanders being the transformative, inspirational candidate in the same way that Obama was? People aren\'t making posters of Bernie\'s face with the word "Hope" written on them, they aren\'t flocking by the hundreds and thousands to hear him speak. People aren\'t attaching unrealistic expectations to him in the same way they did with Obama. He has almost zero media attention, by his own design he can\'t run a campaign on the scale Obama did because he won\'t play to game. This time during leading up to the 08 election Obama was edging closer to Hillary. Bernie is only a blip on her radar because no one else is even trying to run against her.'
p2664
aS'I think the difference is that Obama was a fresh face and relatively new on the political scene in 2008. There\'d been buzz about him for a while, but only a few years\' worth. Whereas Sanders has been around for years and years, and has a lot of buzz on Reddit and in some liberal publications, but nowhere else.\n\n&gt;Even the Socialist thing is not as taboo as it used to be. I think some in middle America are starting to see that having a handful of billionaires as political puppet masters may not be the best thing for the middle class.\n\nSome of them may see that, but when it comes time to vote in primaries, will they put two and two together and make the decision to vote for him rather than for Hillary?\n\n&gt;Still, at this point I will likely vote for Clinton but Sanders has certainly peaked my interest.\n\nI\'m for Clinton all the way -- I think the sense of "fear" captured in the article is accurate, in that he has no real chance of winning and should recognize that, but does also have the potential to damage Hillary\'s chances, which would be a disaster for everyone.'

But what is clear is that had Ted Cruz or Rick Santorum wrote something along these lines--even 40 years ago--the media wouldn't stop talking about it for weeks.\n\nProbably because Cruz and Santorum actually advocate policy that is strongly anti-woman, which Sanders doesn't do.  No, he just wrote an essay forty years ago that, out of context, sounds stupid as hell.  "

p2677
aS'&gt; But you\'re missing the bigger point which is whatever solution is necessary according to experts in those fields will be adapted by Bernie.\n\nI see that bigger picture, but I\'m not convinced Sanders will, in fact, do so, because I\'m not convinced there are policy solutions.\n\n&gt; The deregulation and defunding of those agencies is what allows this to happen and is very much the issue.\n\nWe actually do agree there, I went a bit too far in my counterpoint. That said, getting those changes will require a massive shift in how our society views the purpose of regulation. I\'m not convinced a president is the best person to lead that argument - the president needs to govern first, not fight social battles. I think both Sanders and Warren can do more good as senators in that fight than either could in the Oval Office.\n\n&gt; Or is it a lifestyle choice to have the same operation cost 90k in California and 4 digits in Louisiana or wherever it was?\n\nThose are real benefits to having a single-payer system. I do not disagree. I counter that by saying those discrepancies are not the drivers of overall health care costs. "Lifestyle choices"^1 that are common in the US (high sugar diets, high obesity rates, increase in sedentary jobs) is by [this report](http://www.aetna.com/health-reform-connection/aetnas-vision/facts-about-costs.html) and others expected to contribute some $4 trillion to US healthcare costs and productivity losses due to chronic illness (by 2023). Fixing the $3k/capita gap between the US and Norway on healthcare expenditures will not be solved by making everything cost the same across the board (prices will most likely meet somewhere in the median of the range, evening out on the whole). Instead, it will require some shift in society\'s attitudes towards what a healthy population can do. Frankly, I don\'t see any policy mechanisms that can achieve that - the US is just an unhealthy population.\n\n\nMy overall and entire point is not that any of the issues Sanders identifies aren\'t pressing concerns - it\'s that I don\'t see any effective policy solutions to them as a whole. What I see as needing to happen is a shift in how this country sees itself, and that doesn\'t come from the President. Sanders and Warren will be much more valuable as spokespersons for this ideal of liberalism in the Senate than they could be in the oval office.\n\n\n1. From a non-medical perspective, that\'s an absolutely terrible phrase. "Lifestyle choices" in the medical jargon includes obesity, smoking, alcoholism, all of which are only "choices" in the broadest sense of complete personal autonomy, and ignores the myriad social issues that contribute. This, however, is a discussion for a different thread. '

p2683
aS'&gt;Thats a distinction worth making, particularly given all the digital ink spilled on the GOP hopefuls that also fall short of full-fledged contender status. Like Sanders, Paul, Cruz, and even Huckabee have no credible path to their nomination, let alone the White House. But unlike Sanders, all three are taken largely seriously by the national political press, and for good reason: They have significant bases. Paul gives a voice to libertarian-leaning conservatives, Huckabee to many evangelicals, and Cruz to some combination of the two. They dont need to win their nomination to be worth covering seriously. The same should be true for Sanders. \n\nThis is the central argument of the article, and I think it falls flat on it\'s face because it ignores the actual polling data that he cited. The difference between the first and second tier of candidates is less than 5 points. There is no clear frontrunner at all, so any of the top 10 or so GOP hopefuls have a decent shot at nomination, especially considering [how often the frontrunner status switched hands during the last primary](http://i.imgur.com/YBW2V.png). \n\nNow contrast this with the Democrats\' primary which is already a done deal. Even the author acknowledges it.\n\n&gt;Now, it really would take a miracle for Sanders to overcome Hillary Clintonby some metrics the most dominant nonincumbent in historyto win the nomination\n\n*Of course* Sanders is going to be an afterthought for nightly news political coverage. Sanders only role in this election is how his campaign and presence at the debates will affect Clinton\'s policy declarations going into the election. He flat out hasn\'t earned enough support to warrant "serious" daily coverage.'

You are not paying 39.6% on all 500,000.  Your total effective rate would  actually be roughly 31% when you calculate the taxes for each bracket (10% for the first 9,000, 15% for the next 27,824 and so on.  Sanders wants to raise the tax for the top bracket back to what it was when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, which was 90%.  The very wealthy wouldn't be paying 90% on all of their money, just on the amount of money they earn over $406,000.\n\nPersonally, I think the brackets themselves would have to be adjusted if there was a 90% tax at the top, but I think this is a step in the right direction."

Maybe it will take a generation of people to stand up and be willing to sacrifice for others in order for humanity to take greed seriously. I just don't know.

Somehow he connected to the future when he was a young man and he saw the way that people could be if we want to revolutionize our system of life. And so he's been waiting for the pot to boil, and it's been heating up with the growth of technology and the paradigm shift of the internet, which gave us access to great stores of information.\n\nSo now we have the better capacity to see past the smoke screen of people who seek power for themselves and not to help others. Once we accept that sociopaths are drawn towards politics, we can see the cancer growing inside the government. Bernie Sanders is the miracle worker who knew the cure for our cancer before it had metastasized.\n\nHe doesn't put on a mask because he genuinely wants to fix our country. The other politicians have to put on masks because they really want the power for themselves.\n\nI should write Bernie Sanders and see if I can help him with his campaign."

I have yet to meet someone who is excited over Clinton running- I have met dozens of people who are over the moon Sanders is running. If Clinton gets the nomination, there are quite a few independents who won't vote for her because they don't really want her. No one really wants Clinton- they just accept that it's her turn.

This fact necessitates consumers alternate products for best results. That is settled science. Maybe Sanders is a denier of this fact.\n\nYou are correct overall. The disregarded masses needn't be allowed myriad products. Government could prevent much consternation among commoners by controlling choices. Impoverished urban dwellers, for example, often obsesse on brand name footwear even to the point they will kill, or go hungry, or steal. They have no real need to possess the latest Nike shoe style being promoted by a sellout multimillionaire basketball corporate celebrity. One government produced sneaker in one style and one color would placate poor people.\n\nMao had his jacket. Kim Jong Il had his rayon suit. Pol Pot had his peoples' pie. Governments in the correct hands can do utility for the masses freeing the people to focus on right thought, right behavior, right living. "
p2722
aS"I'd blame it more on the Sanders phenomenon. They know Sanders is at best a left wing fringe candidate who isn't electable to the general electorate. To counter this they have to take Clinton and distort her record so much so that she could not possibly be the nominee thereby clearing the way for Sanders.\n\nThey accomplish this by somehow painting Clinton as a right leaning candidate, beholden to all the same interests, and sharing all the same policy proposals as the undesirable Republican other. Of course this is patently ridiculous, but it persists anyway. \n\nMeanwhile Sanders remains unelectable and our best bet at avoiding a disastrous Republican administration is unfairly undermined by her own ideological brethren. \n\nElection time really is something else."

It's going to be hard to win over moderates when Sanders is a self declared socialist. In my opinion the more moderate candidate will win.  Hillary Clinton is pretty moderate and middle of the road on a lot of things.  Plus, as dumb as it is, people will vote for her just because she's a woman.  Just as much as people like to joke around on here about how they hope Ted Cruz gets the nomination, I think Karl Rove probably feels the same way about Sanders."

Or are you simply saying that the real, existing preferences among voters will translate to a Democratic victory, if all other things were equal and individual voter decisions were all that mattered?\n\nThe way I see it, the voters *should* vote.  Who they vote for is irrelevant, but if it comes down to it I can see real difficulty for Sanders against:\n\n* Jeb Bush (established name and money)\n\n* Chris Christie (proven immunity to scandal and helpful 'connections' of questionable scruples)\n\n* Ted Cruz (more widely recognized than Sanders, likely to have a fundraising edge)\n\n* Bobby Jindal (more charismatic or appealing than Sanders, aesthetically)\n\n* Rick Perry (with a noteworthy immunity to logical argument)\n\nor\n\n* Scott Walker (superhero-popular among neocons, already has Koch backing)\n\nIf the Republican nomination is a slugfest through April, Sanders has a chance because it's not he but Hilary who will be sized up one-by-one against the GOP contenders.  If they can settle on a nominee before there's any chance of a fight in the primaries, the Democrats will be competing against each other on their credentials as combatants of political ideology.\n\nAs political warriors go, Clinton already has the army she needs, but Sanders may not have what it takes to convince people he's got a better shot of beating the Republican."

aS'I see you didn\'t actually read what Sanders wrote and the point he was trying to make. But I agree it\'s damaging to him because it will be taken out of context and sensationalized, it\'s much easier to say "Bernie\'s rape fantasy" in a headline than "Bernie hamhandedly tries to make a point about gender roles 40 years ago". As for Romney, strapping a dog cage to the roof of your car is stupid, it doesnt need context because it is stupid, unless of course you think it\'s smart.'

p2739
aS"No, there are externalities with both decisions, certainly.  I sit on the side of the fence that believes that increasing social policy does not yield sufficient benefit to the greater population, only the direct beneficiaries.  Thinks like socialized medicine, unemployment insurance, welfare, these things benefit greater society in large, tangible ways.\n\nMany of the changes Sanders is promoting only benefit the recipients, and put enormous strains on those paying as well as unintended pains on those he's purportedly attempting to aid.  His recent stance on taxing investment fund transactions to fund colleges is a perfect example of this.  This would hurt every single person with a retirement plan to make going to college a bit easier.  "

aS'This is why I am so glad Bernie Sanders is in the race.  Republicans blame Democrats for the loss of middle class jobs.  Democrats blame republicans.  Most of the constituents have believed what is fed to them and picked a side.\n\nThe reality is that the biggest killer of middle class jobs has been the "free" (actually unfair) trade agreements brokered and approved by both sides of the aisle.  Sanders is bringing that to the people who have ignored it for so long.  Both Democrats and Republicans have been working for decades to "deprive Americans of jobs" through trade agreements.  They just distract your attention by throwing unrelated red meat that he American public happily consumes.\n\nI will say that I was dissatisfied with Sanders vilifying the Republicans during his AMA.  Not that they don\'t deserve it, but his role should be to equally vilify the traditional Democrats and to convince America that he is the Democrat who offers real change...not the "change" that Obama offered.'
p2753
aS"Now, wait a minute.  I think Sanders is a bit of a lunatic, but he's not entirely wrong here and you're misrepresenting the situation.\n\nWhen you make trade deals, you make *trade* products cheaper.  Domestic products are unaffected.  If we had fewer trade deals, we would be forced to retain more manufacturing capacity in this country, which would give us more jobs and elevate the labor classes a little.\n\nIs that bonus for the lower, labor classes worth the cost of increased prices for basic goods?  That's a genuine question.  But you can't dismiss the question by putting up a strawman of $30 underwear.  If we made textiles from Asia that expensive, Americans would buy (and therefore, produce more) clothing made in America.  The added cost might be just pennies on every dollar.\n\nTrade deals cause income inequality by lowering the standard of living for the domestic labor force.  They might be worth it because they also lower prices, but right now this country needs jobs more than it needs cheaper gadgets.  The pendulum has swung way too far in favor of unfettered trade."

We just like to paint ourselves a fairy tale reality where people do the right thing in regard to others and rather than the selfish thing for themselves.

A thirty-year-old in the 1970\'s wrote a Playboy Magazine type article exploring changing norms redefining masculine and feminine gender roles within the context of an hypothetical heterosexual couple whose relationship is strained due to the emotional baggage they each carry from past relationships with those of the opposite sex and - GASP! - they have "taboo" sexual fantasies and masturbate before going to church. \n\nThis is obviously very shocking since: 1. Gender roles have remained unchanged since the days of Adam and his rib, I mean wife, Eve.  2. No one has emotional baggage. And 3. Certainly no one has sexual fantasies or masturbates -especially no one in the 1970\'s.   \n\nClearly, Bernie Sanders is the one that has a problem with women based on his solid record of standing up for women\'s rights and combating domestic violence and definitely not those on the right who deny women their rights and vote against the Violence Against Women Act while fervently preaching about puritanical morality and "family values" in less than subtle misogynistic and homophobic language then get caught with mistresses and gay lovers they sometimes pay off to keep things quiet.'

aS'I have to say, this is causing me to rethink my support for Sanders, though between him and Hillary I think he\'s still likely to prevail.\n\nETA: I found this on Bernie Sanders\' website:\n\n"Sen. Sanders strongly believes the constitutional rights and guarantees that make this country great need not be sacrificed in the name of security. Before being sworn in as a U.S. Senator in 2007, Sanders was one of only 66 members in the U.S. House of Representatives to vote against the USA Patriot Act. He also introduced the first legislation in the House meant to undo some of the unconstitutional provisions in that bill. In the Senate, Sanders has continued to focus on these and other important civil liberty issues, including reining in the NSA\'s warrantless wiretapping program, restoring habeas corpus rights, controlling the use of wide-sweeping presidential signing statements and putting an end to torture. He has introduced S. 1168, the Restore Our Privacy Act, to amend the PATRIOT Act to curtail overly broad surveillance by the government. He also sent a letter to General Keith Alexander, then-head of the NSA, asking if the NSA spies on Congress."\n\nSo, I think it\'s unlikely that he\'s in favor of extending the Patriot Act, or will vote to do so.'
p2802
aS'Again you seem to have no sense of the irony in your arguments. Bernie Sanders is living proof that you are wrong. He has been a great civil servent for his constituents. He served four terms as mayor of Burlington and then was elected to the House and ultimately the Senate by the people he served. They certainly were happy with his work.\n\nAs for how much money he made... Why is it so hard to imagine that might not be the best measure of a politician. I would argue that to do so is in fact backwards. Many politicians trade on their insider knowledge or use their connections to make money in ways that normal people cannot. The fact that Sanders did not do those things makes me think more of him not less.'
p2803
aS"I'm glad to see him in the race.\n\n\nInitially I was one of those who loved everything Sanders said and stood for but I didn't think he could get elected. I now believe Sanders is electable. But I still like someone else in the mix pushing Hillary and I see him taking more support away from her than from Sanders."
p2804
aS"I don't think either one has a very high chance, honestly, but at least Sanders has a certain base of support in the party.  I don't know of anyone who likes O'Malley.  \n\nAlso, O'Malley is trying to claim to run to the left of Hillary, but his record shows he's actually to her right, which is going to make that hard.\n\nhttp://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/martin-omalley-shouldnt-try-to-out-liberal-hillary-clinton/"

aS"Did you actually read the link, or just buy what he said outright?\n\nSanders didn't vote yes on bulk collection.  He voted to end the debate, and get the bill on the floor - which he has always voted no on.  Not the same thing, at all.  It is worries *me* that reddit is buying this kind of blatant BS from commenters.  "

aS"Only in a sense. Bernie Sanders did indeed vote for cloture and that is the best time to kill a bill. His vote may change when it comes to the actual vote, but is upon us as the electorate to ensure that he does indeed stand up for civil liberties and not just go along with Obama's version of the patriot act (misleading name and all)\n\nThere's a special session of the Senate this Sunday and we need to name and shame those that vote to continue to violate our civil liberties instead of letting section 215 expire."
p2810
aS'I find it interesting that you\'re so vehemently willing to defend Sanders on this issue. Let\'s compare Sanders\' actions and Rand\'s actions, assuming both are against the Patriot Act. \n\nSanders voted for cloture. If cloture passed, there would be a direct vote on whether or not to extent the Patriot Act. Cloture requires 60 votes, but the real vote only requires 51. If cloture can be reached, chances are the real vote has a decent chance of being passed as well. If cloture is not reached before Sunday *there is zero chance those provisions are reauthorized*. Sanders vote *increases* the chances of the Patriot Act being renewed from "zero" to "possible."\n\nRand voted against cloture. Without cloture, debate is allowed to continue. If no agreement is reached by this Sunday a number of provisions in the Patriot Act expire, including bulk collection of metadata by the NSA. Rand, and a number of other senators, not only voted against cloture, but are also taking action (filibuster) to prolong debate on the bill to reach that deadline so that the Patriot Act provisions expire. Rand\'s vote (and accompanying actions, what you call a "pointless circus show") *decreased* the chance of the Patriot Act being renewed. \n\n'

aS"I really wish they would teach the history of free and compulsory common school movement in the USA.  [This is the text we used in school.](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED119389.pdf)  \n\nDuring the 1850's there was the steadying increase in people moving to cities.  With 100's of thousands of children in places like NYC which had long been abused and exploited as cheap labor, something had to be done.  Free common schools were proposed.  Factory owners freaked the fuck out about free school, and had their own regressive paid off politicians attempt to stop it.  Immigrant families mobilized, some violently, and we got common schools across country as law by the 1870's mostly.  The South held out longest. \n\nWhen Bernie Sanders brings free college education to the attention of the USA during the primaries expect the same sort of backlash from corporations today.  Retail, services, and the food industry depend on a market of 10's of millions of low skilled workers.    "

It was very poorly written in a way I certainly would not write it now. But if you read it, what you find is that is a bad situation for both people: women shouldnt be dependent.

aS"It is in a presidential election unless it looks like they already have a good chance of winning.\n\n\nVoting third party in a presidential election means that votes that would usually go to either party would not go to them, but to the third party. Third parties are usually not centrist, but left or right at varying extremes - so the votes they take away tend to be from one side.\n\nThis causes a spoiler vote, think 2000 George Bush election. Third party votes took away from the electoral college and gave it to the Republicans, giving George Bush the win without winning the popular vote.\n\nOn top of that, the government is rigged to run with a Republican or Democratic president. The party you are not a part of is going to constantly try to sabotage you within congress. If you are a third party, neither democrat or republican, both parties are going to be fighting against you because it is in their best interest to make your term look terrible so their party has  a better shot next term.\n\nNo, third party is a waste in presidential elections. Want to vote an independent or third party congressman or senator? Go for it, they tend to play ball with Democrats or Republicans in congress and get things done. \n\nThere's a reason Sanders is running democrat even though he's an independent, and this is it. "

aS'\n&gt;President Barack Obama stated that the decision "gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washingtonwhile undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates".[58] Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, "this ruling strikes at our democracy itself" and "I can\'t think of anything more devastating to the public interest".[59] On January 27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, "Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law[60] to open the floodgates for special interestsincluding foreign corporationsto spend without limit in our elections. Well I don\'t think American elections should be bankrolled by America\'s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities." On television, the camera shifted to a shot of the SCOTUS judges in the front row directly in front of the President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his head side to side while mouthing the words "Not true".[61][62][63][64][65][66]\n\n&gt;Democratic senator Russ Feingold, a lead sponsor of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, stated "This decision was a terrible mistake. Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president."[67] Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat, stated that it was "the worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case, and that the court had opened the door to political bribery and corruption in elections to come.[68] Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards, along with constitutional law professor and Maryland Democratic State Senator Jamie Raskin, have advocated petitions to reverse the decision by means of constitutional amendment.[69] Rep. Leonard Boswell introduced legislation to amend the constitution.[70] Senator John Kerry also called for an Amendment to overrule the decision.[71] On December 8, 2011, Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the Saving American Democracy Amendment, which would reverse the court\'s ruling.\n\nThe Supremes got it wrong.  Some of them (Alito) obviously never understood what it was about: power and disenfranchisement.\n\nNaturally someone who supports the pink satin pants would try to claim that opponents "support a rewrite of the first amendment."\n\n\n&gt; The Supreme Court reversed this decision, striking down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from making independent expenditures and "electioneering communications".\n\n&gt; The United States Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by a nonprofit corporation. The principles articulated by the Supreme Court in the case have also been extended to for-profit corporations, labor unions and other associations.\n\n\nAll that\'s from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC\n\nWhat I get alarmed at is the flagrant attempt to make this only "about the first amendment" and raise up the kind of entity we fought against, a corporation, just to be free, just to be a country.\n\nThat seems really shabby to me.'

aS'Of the people doing this sort if thing Sanders seems the most active. '
p2844
aS'The fact is that Bernie Sanders is a crackpot and his ideas are lunatic fringe. I told my wife about the guy who wants a 90% top tax rate (applicable only to the "rich") and she even said that anyone who votes for this guy has to be some sort of idiot. '
p2845
aS"Just wondering, why isn't Bernie Sanders helping to dismantle the NSA? I thought he was the savior of the human race"
p2846
aS'Not that big and not from someone so very very far behind. Sanders is no Barack Obama. Underestimate Secretary Clinton at your peril.'
p2847
aS'Bernie "Air Tight" Sanders spewing populist propaganda for welfare recipients.'
p2848
aS'&gt;Sanders is no Barack Obama.\n\nWhich is why Hillary should be scared to death.  Bernie is the real deal.'
p2849
aS"&gt; even Ron Paul packed 4000+ at college venues\n\nRon Paul had run for president before, had a lot more media exposure, and even had a newsletter business branded with his name - he had *far* better name recognition and public exposure at the point he had rallies like the one you're talking about than Bernie Sanders does at present."
p2850
aS'How do this many people not understand how disingenuous Sanders is being here? This could be an episode of House of Cards where Frank rallies support for the PATRIOT ACT and then himself votes against it to keep his image up. People would probably "get it" then. A vote for cloture when you know the current lay of the room is in support of the patriot act IS a vote for the patriot act REGARDLESS of how you actually vote on the bill. '
p2851
aS'Heard it on Hartmann...they said there were three speakers (at the whatever convention/ even), Sanders had so many supporters that he needed to use and extra room for the overflow, Paul (hypocritical, lying, wigman) hat 100, and Ted Cruz had 50...between his abortion views, reversing his military presence views, and civil rights and environment, he is a world class idiot, and a Kock brother shill...\n'
p2852
aS"The same exact thing can said about Ron Paul and the Republican platform, but at the end of the day if the oligarchy doesn't want you as the president, you're not going to be the president. And clearly, Bernie Sanders does not have the blessings of Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, et cetera."
p2853
aS'Bernie Sanders wants to give everyone free everything. The only way to do that is to have the power to take everything away from everyone.'
p2854
aS'Do you believe that Bernie Sanders has a saner economic policy than Rand Paul?'
p2855
aS"Most of what Sanders wants is pretty sane.\n\nYou're trying to compare someone that wants to fix the education system and give us a single payer healthcare system to someone that wants to slash taxes and cut funding to the government.\n\nWe have evidence the things sanders wants will work, we have evidence flat out slashing taxes is a horrible idea.\n\nWhich one is more sane to you."
p2856
aS"You make the assumption that the party who wants to end cloture wants to also pass the bill. What if they want it on the record that they are the ones that killed it ? If they can get 60 votes they can get the 51 needed to **vote nay**. Why is everyone assuming that not being an obstructionist means you want the bill to pass? Obstructing procedure should be used sparingly. I don't understand why everyone assumes these people will pass it. I mean god damn. Bernie Sanders is on the vote. He will not vote for the bill to pass under any circumstance."
p2857
aS"Bernie Sanders is a known Socialist. I can't even believe you are trying to argue this. Weather you think Socialism is bad or good or right or wrong is one thing but to openly deny something that is blatantly obvious is hilarious. Wake the fuck up dude, Bernie Sanders is very, VERY, socialist."
p2858
aS'Bernie Sanders doesn\'t have anything in his pocket to give. The only way that he can give anything is to take it away from someone else, rob Peter to pay Paul. I guess that people supporting him must think that they\'re Paul and someone else is Peter. Eat the rich. It never seems to work out that way, though. The rich are always better positioned to get into control of power than the public.\n\nSo, I find Rand Paul\'s humble approach to economics saner. He\'s not promising to give me anything and that\'s just fine. I can make my way through the world. I find it a lot easier to believe someone who says, "I won\'t give you anything but I won\'t take anything from you" compared to "I\'ll give you everything you could ever need for free."'
p2859
aS'Sanders has a good voting record on this stuff. Personally I plan to donate equal amounts to both, register independent, and vote for whichever is doing better by the time the primaries get to my state.'
p2860
aS'Ah yes, the dirty ol Sanders trying to steal your money to make the country a better place.\n\nWe should keep our student loan debt bubble and out of control healthcare costs.\n\nWho cares if it bankrupts us, as long as you can save a few dollars in taxes right?\n\n'
p2861
aS'&gt;Weather you think Socialism is bad or good or right or wrong is one thing but to openly deny something that is blatantly obvious is hilarious. \n\nI\'m a socialist. I think socialism is a good thing. Just look at my post history.\n\n&gt;Wake the fuck up dude, Bernie Sanders is very, VERY, socialist.\n\nShow me one instance where Bernie Sanders says something like "the means of production should be democratically owned by the proletariat." Bernie Sanders is a **social democrat**  who erroneously labels himself as a socialist.'
p2862
aS'Dude you clearly want to see a conspiracy here, as far as I can tell Sanders has won past elections by talking about the issues, and honestly representing his beliefs. \n\nThat\'s what\'s attracted me to him, and when I read other people\'s opinions that seems to be the same thing other people who are interested in him see. \n\nI\'m telling you that I\'m carrying water for him out of a desire to see him succeed and you\'re ignoring me. \n\nMaybe there\'s a concerted vote effort going on, if there is I\'m not aware of it, but it to me seems incredibly unlikely given how many times sanders has demonstrated that he doesn\'t engage in the sort of cynical politics that most politicians take part in. Which again is part of why I am working in my own time to help support him.\n\nMovements must be very strange to people who can\'t squash the cynical voice in their head saying "these people can\'t possibly believe this or want to support that."\n\nWe can, we do, we are.'
p2863
aS"Literally the only vote Sanders has made that doesn't stand with this is his recent vote of cloture, which is not the same as being in favor of something."
p2864
aS'Since when does Sanders take the constitution seriously?'
p2865
aS'*Sigh*...\n\n1. [Bernie Sanders "self describes" as a socialist](http://www.democracynow.org/2006/11/8/vermonts_bernie_sanders_becomes_first_socialist).\n\n2. [Could a Socialist Senator Become a National Brand?](http://www.npr.org/2014/07/10/330193246/could-a-socialist-senator-become-a-national-brand).\n\n3. ["Self Proclaimed Socialist"](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/21/bernie-sanders-socialist-vermont-interview).\n\nI could go on but Bernie Sanders is without a doubt, 100%, socialist. His ideals are socialist, and he is also a Socialist Democrat. That is why he runs as an Independent under the Democrat flag. \n\nDo you listen to his speeches? He recently had one where he described having too many "deodorant brands" and that a better use of resources would be to only have "one brand that everyone would use". This brand, in his mind, would be owned and operated by the Government (i.e. "people"). I would find an exact quote but Google is plastered with extremely unbiased articles about said quote, and I\'m afraid anything I like will be ridiculed as not worthy of your approval because of said bias. \n\nHe wants a huge central government which owns/operates all of the nations resources and businesses. He is without a doubt, SELF DESCRIBED, Socialist. Now, if you want to discuss the pros and cons of Socialism, we can do that, but Bernie Sanders is Socialist.'
p2866
aS'Not every candidate. It\'s just "Oh, look. Sanders took a shit today."'
p2867
aS'Dude you are seeing movements and confusing them with astroturfing and conspiracy. \n\nRand Paul, like Ron Paul is very popular with the libertarian elements of reddit. \n\nHillary Clinton, as the first credible female candidate for president, second if we count her previous run, gets a lot of very enthusiastic support from a wide range of women, some women even reddit!\n\nAnd Bernie Sanders has his largest support block nationally in millennials, who also happen to reddit. \n\nAgain let your cynicism die a slow death or come up with some actual evidence to support your claims. '
p2868
aS'Looks like Bernie Sanders is too busy giving TV interviews rather than fighting this in the Senate.'
p2869

You can witness this yourself. Asking for evidence for vote boosting is like asking for evidence that the sky is blue, look out your window. '
p2870
aS"At this point my expectations are so low that I only ask two things of presidential candidates: don't turn the U.S. into an Orwellian nightmare, and don't turn the world into a post-apocalyptic wasteland with global warming.\n\nSanders is the only one who's good on both. But if, by the time my state does primaries, the Democrats have gone ahead and coronated Clinton then I'll vote for the only other candidate who's any good on the first issue."
p2871
aS"Because he's the only Independent.. Enemy of my enemy and all that. \n\nDon't change the original statement. Sanders is not a hack. Sure, he's a politician but his track record speaks for itself."
p2872
aS"&gt; I think you're underestimating how much his message resonates with millenials and younger redditors.\n\nI think you're vastly overestimating how his message resonates with millennials.\n\nhttp://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_FL_32415.pdf\n\nOn the last page of that poll you can see that from the younger age group, Sanders has less support from that group, than the older group. However, both groups vastly give more support towards Clinton.\n\nIf you look at that poll, literally every Republican has a higher favorability to the younger demographic, than Sanders does."
p2873
aS'&gt;and that his refusal to participate in arrogant pandering will come as a welcome relief\n\nAll Sanders has said is pretty much "Free School", "Free Healthcare."\n\nAll that is is literally pandering. It\'s even worse than pandering, it\'s a blatant attempt to buy votes by offering people free shit.'
p2874
aS'If Bernie Sanders were being honest he would say, "Today I just introduced legislation that would require all working Americans to pay for college tuition."'
p2875
aS'Socialists want to decentralize the economy, sorry buddy. You have no idea what socialism is and if you think Bernie Sanders is a socialist you are plainly wrong.'
p2876
aS'And I\'m an actual socialist so I know what I\'m talking about. You think Bernie Sanders is a socialist so clearly you know nothing. Where and when has he ever denounced private property or imperialism or said something like "the means of production should be democratically controlled by the proletariat"? He\'s not a fucking socialist and liberals like you do not have the jurisdiction to redefine socialism as "whatever Sweden does". Bernie Sanders is at best a social democrat or state capitalist.\n\nIf you\'re so convinced that Bernie Sanders is a socialist, go to /r/socialism and tell them that and watch them laugh at you.'
p2877
aS"You mean other than voting yes on the NSA reform bill, of which Bernie Sanders isn't even sure how he is going to vote on?\n\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/05/31/bernie_sanders_on_usa_freedom_act_i_may_well_be_voting_for_it_does_not_go_far_enough.html\n\n "

"
p2880
aS'Is he wrong?  Did Bernie Sanders not vote for cloture? Or are you trying to distract from what Sanders did by crying shill.'
p2881
aS'So VOTE Sanders.'
p2882
aS"I think it's more about socialism/communism's inherent design, that in order to give everyone stuff you have to take stuff from some. Sanders is unashamedly socialist. Considering the current mess that is government, I would not support it having expanded powers to waste money and erode the middle class."
p2883
aS"And Hillary has barely changed. Sanders has moved up because people realize that Warren isn't running. "
p2884
aS'Were Nike, Shell and Boeing crowding the room to slurp the commie spew that Bernie "Air Tight" Sanders was offering?  Are you saying corporations are people?  OR, was it a bunch of failures in life looking to expand their hand out from the earners in the society?'
p2885
aS"I love how this obvious editorial parody trolls conservatives in more than one way. It trolls the few who actually read the article and see that *wah-wah-wah-wah* Sanders' record speaks for itself; and the many who don't read it, and pass it along thinking it's a negative expos."
p2886
aS'Sanders is self admitted socialist. If you happen to be one of the dullards that still think that religion, I mean ideology is something new and "progressive" and will help "the little guy" I honestly feel sorry for you. \n\nGuys like Sanders can only make their voice heard by constantly agitating for more divisions and an us against them mentality. Class warfare. Racial animus. Gender hatred and division. It\'s disgusting and so so very OLD.\n\n"Let us wage a moral and political war against the billionaires and corporate leaders, on Wall Street and elsewhere, whose policies and greed are destroying the middle class of America."'
p2887
aS"Bernie Sanders is my hero. I'd name my first born after him but Bernie is a rather terrible first name."
p2888
aS'Bernie Sanders talks a good game but he didn\'t lift a finger in this entire surveillance debate.  He didn\'t show up to filibuster with Rand Paul while other Democrat Senators did.  Socialists and Communists ultimately want a surveillance state, how else will they know if you\'re "contributing" or not?'
p2889
aS'Is Bernie Sanders starting to seem like an unstoppable juggernaut to anyone else?'
p2890
aS"&gt;Mrs. Clinton is far ahead in the polls, fund-raising and name recognition, however, and she is expected to continue to have a much more organized and sophisticated campaign operation in Iowa and nationwide than Mr. Sanders does. Her mix of centrist and progressive Democratic views may yet prove more appealing to the broadest number of party voters as well, while some of Mr. Sanderss policy prescriptions  including far higher taxes on the wealthy and deep military spending cuts  may eventually persuade Democrats that he is unelectable in a general election.\n\nHillary is leading 60-15 in Iowa against Bernie Sanders. I know there's another 8 months until the caucus, but the shift in support that would need to occur for Sanders to pull off a win Iowa just doesn't seem plausible."
p2891
aS'&gt; filibuster\n\nThere was no filibuster.\n\nSanders has a record of being against the Patriot Act for years.\n'
p2892
aS"You obviously were not following what happened. this entire past week.  By senate terminology he did not filibuster, yet he procedurally delayed the reauthorization and any votes on the USA Freedom act.  Sanders did NOTHING.  Saying you're against something and doing something about it is completely different.  Sanders wants the USA freedom Act, which is patriot act lite, it still authorizes bulk data collection.  Last time they voted on the USA freedom Act, they almost hit the 60 vote threshold, good thing they didn't and GOOD THING Rand Paul delayed the entire process.  The bulk data provisions of the patriot act is due to expire in 5.5 hours and it will have been all because of everything Rand Paul did in the last week and none of it will be because of Sanders.  So much for being against something for so many years, what good has he done?"
p2893
aS'It\'s cute how you try to pretend like you\'re enlightened.\n\nTrying to pretend like following an ideology is exactly the same as following a religious faith is a really dumb and simplistic mindset. Religious doctrine can certainly *be* an ideology but pretending that agreeing that the poor shouldn\'t be left starving in the streets is the same as believing in a religion is just pathetic.\n\nIt\'s also adorable how you try to shroud your distaste towards making people\'s lives easier by attacking the very notion of ideology while maintaining the status quo (the definition of conservatism) is also an ideology. Funny how that works.\n\nClass struggle is a really important thing because of Neo-Conservative policies that resulted in wasteful Middle Eastern conflicts and a global economic crash. Lone people can\'t create these conflicts in people\'s minds, they exist because they\'re *actually there*.\n\nDo you really think that motherfucking Bernie Sanders made people aware of the unchecked power of the super rich? Do you really think people hold up signs that say "Black Lives Matter" or hold gay pride parades or feminist marches because they want to stir shit up and spend their time fighting tooth and nail for this or that stated goal or change for shits and giggles? If you do then you are the definition of a conservative reactionary, having a knee-jerk disagreement with really any call for change.\n\nYou are really sad and I\'m getting sick of talking to you, it just feels like it\'s fueling your lunacy so see ya.'
p2894
aS'Bernie Sanders voted to limit debate on the patriot act.'
p2895
aS'You say "Buying them with promises of doing good things" as if that\'s bad.\n\nPromising to change things for the better is how literally every politician in the history of the world has been elected to power.\n\nSanders is promising economic reform. Lincoln promised social change. There\'s no difference.'
p2896
aS"I would hope it's a bigger strategy to have no debate but to invoke cloture votes on the Freedom Act or maybe to help Paul extend an impending filibuster. I don't doubt what Sanders does right now and I'm not as in tune on Senate rules with this type of rushed conferencing but I feel like there's a bigger game here."
p2897
aS'And so did Warren. \n\nNot only did neither Warren nor Sanders join in the bipartisan Paul/Wyden attempt to stop the Patriot Act, they literally both just effectively voted for it (I know what cloture is) . But I would bet everything that tomorrow there will be another thread on here about how Bernie is against the surveillance and Rand Paul is crazy. This is a joke. '
