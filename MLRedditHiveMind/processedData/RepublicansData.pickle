S"This. If a third party received enough votes the last election (they did not), they'd be eligible to receive up to $90ish million in campaign funds.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democrats and the Republicans are set to spend over a billion dollars per candidate.\n\nThere is a reason that Obama et al have eschewed using public funds in their campaigns: they want to have a chance to win."
p65
aS'"Unfortunately, House Republicans refused to give the Senate bill an up-or-down vote.\n\nThats why the President took action to fix as much of the broken system as he could through his immigration accountability executive actions. These actions will help secure the border, prioritize felons, not families, and hold undocumented immigrants accountable by requiring them to pass a criminal background check and pay their fair share of taxes, and modernizes the legal immigration system. These are common-sense steps, but only Congress can finish the job.\n\nThree critical elements of the President\'s executive actions are:\n\n    Cracking Down on Illegal Immigration at the Border: The Presidents actions increase the chances that anyone attempting to cross the border illegally will be caught and sent back. Continuing the surge of resources that effectively reduced the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally this summer, the Presidents actions will also centralize border security command-and-control to continue to crack down on illegal immigration.\n    Deporting Felons, Not Families: The Presidents actions focus on the deportation of people who threaten national security and public safety. He has directed immigration enforcement to place anyone suspected of terrorism, violent criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers at the top of the deportation priority list.\n    Accountability  Criminal Background Checks and Taxes: The President is also acting to hold accountable those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years and are parents of U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents. By registering and passing criminal and national security background checks, millions of undocumented immigrants will start paying their fair share of taxes and temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation for three years at a time.\n\nThe Presidents actions will also streamline legal immigration to boost our economy and will promote naturalization for those who qualify."\n\nSo, yeah, he\'s working on it, after giving Congress lots of room to do it themselves.  Now Congress is demanding Obama stop working on it, which you should also feel free to complain about - oh, you already did.\n\nAaaaand from your comment history I can see you\'re mostly just a trollbot generating more heat than light, so I am done trying to teach anything here.'

aS"If he makes the primaries, and there is a good chance that he will, in my opinion, then he may as well get a tent and camp in the white house garden. Republicans need to make three swing states; Florida, Ohio, and PA before they can have a shot. With the way things are changing in those states, and Texas' new liberal population, a candidate with a 99% view can almost certainly swipe at least one of those states. "

p71
aS"Fair enough. I respect the passion and drive of idealists. I think they have the internal fire to be the best activists. If you want those ideals represented, you're going to have the convince the country over a long period of time. \n\nClearly, in a lot of areas, the country has moved towards the left. I think it is why Republicans are struggling so bad with a weak field. They don't know what they are for. The only thing uniting them is Obama hatred.\n\nAnd I have a chip on my shoulder from all the Clinton hate. The Clintons brought Democrats in from a DECADES long cold. And yet every liberal sees them as those evil triangulating, establishment politicians. It's very frustrating. "
p72
aS"I think low voter turnout is due to people thinking both Democrats and Republicans suck and there's no significant difference to their lives between them. It's like choosing between a giant douche and a turd sandwich: why vote if those are the choices?"
p73
aS"Well of course he does.\n\nObama is a Democrat.  Democrats caused the financial crisis.\n\n\nMind you, I don't believe this for a second, but Tea Party folks like Cruz and his supporters absolutely believe this.  The reasoning goes like this...\n\nThe economy was doing just fine until the Democrats took over Congress in January of 2007.  Within just a few months, the whole shebang began to unravel.\n\nWhen you point out that there's literally no way the Democratic controlled Congress could have tanked the economy in less than one year, they'll fall back to their next position:\n\nWhen Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, it was Barney Frank and a few other Democrats who passed legislation that led to the economic crisis.  \n\n\nIf you are so bold to point out that they could only do so with the compliance of the GOP and George W. Bush, they'll fall back on the next position:\n\nThe housing crisis was caused by Jimmy Carter with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\n\nNever mind that there were 12 years of Republicans in the White House afterwards.  No, those Democrats over there are the reason your house isn't worth anything and your retirement accounts suck!  I saw 'em do it!  And that Barack Obama is a Democrat too!\n\n\n\nSeriously, this is the reasoning which allows someone like Cruz to get elected."

aS"What? So he can tell the truth in a debate against who's ever the craziest person in Your party. I keep saying it. The debate will look like Nixon debating Kennedy. With the Librat.. I mean Republicans being the proverbial Nixon."
p75
aS'I don\'t the buy the "Oligarchy-lite" idea.  Hillary is probably more corrupt and corporatist than most Republicans.'
p76
aS'Lets just remember, more than half the Senate (then) Democrats who voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Bill, by 1976 were registered Republicans.   The Republican Party welcomed the likes of Strom Thurmond and a bunch of the others with open arms.   To the point that you guys were celebrating their careers and saying Thurmond should have been elected President in 1948....  because he was against the anti-Lynching law.  He was out and out 100% openly pro-murder and the Republicans welcomed him into their party. \n\nAlso, the 1964 Republican Nominee for President (Barry Goldwater) and the 1964 Republican Party Platform was anti-Civil Rights.  \n\nAnyone who was welcomed into the Republican Party, who retired from politics as a Republican, should be counted as a Republican in those statistics.  You are just using Statistics to lie to people about Reality.  \n\nThe Democrats threw those jack asses out of the Democratic Party.  The Republicans welcomed them and celebrated them.  '

[Here's a Duke University study from October 2014, ten years later, which indicates otherwise.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8796v1.pdf)\n\nIf you look at more recent studies they indicate that gerrymandering is a huge problem and has gotten very significantly worse in the 10 years between when the study you linked and when the one I linked came out. [For example,](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/01/3597643/this-study-could-end-the-worst-kinds-of-gerrymandering-if-the-supreme-court-took-the-time-to-read-it/)\n\n&gt; In 2012, Democratic U.S. House candidates in North Carolina received 81,190 more votes that Republicans. Republicans received just under half of the votes earned by the two parties. And yet, the GOP walked away with 9 of the states 13 congressional districts. So, despite the fact that they earned just over 49 percent of the two-party vote, Republicans won nearly 70 percent of the states congressional seats.\n\n[Here's a news article with an audio recording and interviews that you can listen to if you're interested.](http://wunc.org/post/duke-mathematicians-investigate-2012-election-results-north-carolina)"

aS'Yes. But the majority of politicians, including Hilary, largely believe in what they think will get them elected. \n\nAs for why that matters, consider what\'s been going on at the other end of the political spectrum. That\'s essentially the *real* effect that the "Tea Party" has had on the Republicans. Most Republicans are still the same ones they\'ve always been, most incumbents haven\'t gotten overthrown. But they\'ve shifted their voting and political stances way towards what the Tea Partiers wanted, the Republican party today is much further right/libertarian (economically) than the Republican party of 10 years ago.\n\nThe point being, if you have a bunch of Bernie Sanders\'s running, polling pretty well, and occasionally unseating an incumbent in some of the most far-Left districts, you\'re going to pull the party in that direction to adjust.'

aS'I understand the argument but...who will Dems vote for that are disenfranchised with Hillary or "Swing" voters who think all the Republicans lean too far right?'
p81
aS'The article you mentioned talks about redistricting and the effect that redistricting has had versus previous district boundaries, but never specifically mentions gerrymandering.\n\n&gt; Republican legislators and governors drew district lines for 173 of the 435 seats in Congress.[9] Where Republican legislators controlled redistricting, Republicans likely won 11 more seats than they would have under the old district lines. Five of these 11 were seats that flipped party control due to redistricting; six were Republican seats saved by redistricting. **In states where Republicans controlled redistricting, Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats. But even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats.**\n\n&gt; Democratic legislators and governors redistricted 44 seats, just one-quarter the number of seats as Republicans.[10] But they still used redistricting to their advantage. Where they controlled redistricting, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, and Republicans lost five more seats. **In the six states where Democrats controlled redistricting, Democratic candidates for the House won about 56 percent of the vote and 71 percent of the seats. However, that disparity would have persisted even before redistricting, as Democrats would have likely won 61 percent of the seats under the old district lines.**\n\nSo what they\'re saying here may be a little unclear to the reader. It doesn\'t imply that the previous district boundaries were reasonable.\n\nWhat it does say flat out is that in Republican-controlled states Republican candidates won 53% of the vote and 72% of the seats, versus the 65% of seats they would have won under the old already-Gerrymandered district lines.\n\nIt also says flat out that in the Democratic-controlled states, Democratic candidates got 56% of the vote but won 71% of the seats. That is an increase from 61% under the previous already-gerrymandered district lines.\n\nIn fact, the article you linked to doesn\'t contain a single instance of the word "gerrymander" or "gerrymandered".\n\nThe statistics you posted indicate some very substantial increases of the difference between the percentage of seats that would have been won based on voting percentage versus the percentage that were won based on the new district guidelines. This seems to me like a very good indication that gerrymandering is being used effectively to make the results not match the votes. And again, yes, the study I originally linked to was for North Carolina specifically, but it did indicate that there were almost no way that certain particular things could have happened without gerrymandering, like saying\n&gt; Nonetheless it is interesting to note the racial makeup of the districts created by\nour model and compare them to the current figures. Figure 7 gives the results for\nthe African American and Hispanic populations. Our samples never produced a majority\nAfrican American district. \n\nSo when creating a system to draw district guidelines based on possible priorities that could be used and that were not specifically intending to isolate African-American voters into just two districts, their models  **never** produced a majority African-American district.\n\nSaying that nationally "The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under the old district lines," is **not** the same as saying "The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under reasonable district lines."\n\nAnd this isn\'t to say that Democrats didn\'t gerrymander. The fact that Republicans gerrymander does not mean that Democrats didn\'t gerrymander where they had power. The "only six seats" thing is a red herring in so many different ways. It\'s also not like "Well all seats are districted reasonably, except these six gerrymandered seats." The "six seats" thing is such a useless bit of information for this discussion.\n\nAnd really, "It\'s been done since 1812 and it should be done that way because it\'s always been that way," is **not** an argument.'

Most people think they are closer to center and they use sites like HuffPo, Vox, ThinkProgress, etc to satisfy their preconceived opinions. We also see people comparing America to countries that lean much further left to make the argument that America is conservative. And while we are more conservative than some other nations that does not mean our own we do not have our own bell shaped curve.

That\'s not what\'s going on here, nor is it what even the shrillest feminist has ever claimed.\n\nThis is a social issue; the wage gap is something that emerges as women embark on careers and attempt to rise up in businesses. It comes about for many reasons, some of which equal pay laws address, and some of which they do not. Part of the wage gap is caused by beliefs about how women perform in the workplace at certain jobs--for example, that women are worse at math and science than men. These societal biases can cause some (note: not all) male bosses at some (please note again: not all, or even most) companies to invest more time and give more attention to male employees.\n\nAnother big factor for some jobs is maternity/paternity leave policies in America. Oddly enough, Republicans object to addressing that, too.\n\n\nOh and FYI, at a $60,000, 6.6% less is a $4,000 difference.

I am assuming there must be one for you to be so excited. Because most people know nine times out of ten it is just lip service on the part of the politician. And when it comes to republicans almost always boils down to tax cuts and abolishing capital gains taxes and estate taxes. Which yes would in some way simplify things. But would be realistically unworkable and in fact do more harm than good. \n\n&gt;Obamacare with something that gives people more choice\n\nWhere is his detailed plan for this? This is the same empty rhetoric republicans have spouted for 6 years. They have tried to repeal 50 to 60 tines. And to this day have not suggested a single workable replacement. And again this is nothing new or different. It is standard boilerplate rhetoric every republican has run on since the passage of the ACA. \n\n&gt;opening the books at the Federal Reserve\n\nThere are bigger fish to fry than the fed. And I say that as no big fan of theirs.  But again. This is just empty rhetoric on the part of Cruz. He has no actual road map or idea here. It is just one of those things certain people like to hear. Red meat buzz words that excite specific groups regardless of the fact nothing will change. Nearly every republican candidate for the last decade had said the same. \n\n&gt;and in general sending back power from Washington DC to the states,\n\nThis is a rather genuinely horrible idea. One only needs to look at many of the unconstitutional abortion restrictions red states are wasting millions of their tax payers money defending against the inevitable. As well as many of the same states being on the wrong side of modern civil rights issues. As well as little to no safety or environmental protections in them. The states rights rallying cry is again more empty rhetoric that could never actually work but it's trotted out every single election cycle. \n\n&gt;including states being able to legalize marijuana.\n\nThis is already happening. Only with the system we have it will eventually be legal everywhere. If it were left to state's rights it would never be legalized many places. Besides ted cruz has been against pot for a long time. Criticizing Obama for doing the very thing he is saying he would now do. Simply because he is campaigning. And there is a certain segment of people (perhaps including yourself)that seem easily duped on this. \n\n&gt;Basically, everything Republicans have talked about doing for 20 years but never gotten around to because of corrupting influences.\n\nRepublicans have not been held back by corruption. They actively say one thing while doing the opposite. And before you get up in arms democrats are fairly bad on that front as well. But they are better. And that is an important distinction. "

Because money donated directly to a candidate is regulated these Super PACs essentially pay for TV ads and other expenses the campaign would've paid for otherwise. This allows them to collect multi-million dollar checks legally since it isn't being given to the candidate's campaign.\n\nThe money he is currently receiving are low dollar individual donations which are subject to FEC regulations and are not the type of fundraising he has been referring to.\n\nAlso, he isn't really outraising anyone.

Pretty much the *only* thing he has going for him is support from the far-left youth- a demographic with such an abysmal voting record, that it is arguably the least important voting demographic in the country. The biggest youth turn-out for a presidential election was in 2008 at 51%, still significantly below the average for other dems... And that was when a cool, charismatic, young black guy was running. \n\nFiveThiryEight, one of the most reputable and accurate election forecasters in the country, has literally said "he doesn\'t have a shot". He polls 57 points behind Clinton nationally, which is a monumental gap that will be nearly impossible to even half-way close. Having a bunch of your fringe supporters donate to your campaign the first day doesn\'t change that. And, let\'s be honest- yeah, he out raised what other Republicans raised on their first days, but it\'s not like it was by a massive amount. Paul raised just over $1 million and Cruz raised just under that.\n\nIt\'s not like there is some monumental movement to get Sanders elected- just a very loyal and very dedicated small following that will probably get him through Iowa and New Hampshire and then fade into non-existence come March.'

aS'&gt;  everyone in the media and the pundits and everyone who keeps your mind set of thinking the people who would vote for the old way thought obama would be a complete failure.\n\nThat\'s not true at all. Obama actually received a [fairly significant level of establishment support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Endorsements). By this time in 2007, [he was polling](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html) within 10 points of Clinton. Along with Edwards, and Clinton, Obama was treated as a top rate candidate, though Clinton had been considered the presumptive nominee from the start. And on that note, [Clinton\'s position in 2016 outpaces her position in 2008](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-iowa-2016/); the "inevitability" of her in 2008 is not at all comparable to the same claim for 2016. (Not that the last bit is particularly relevant, but but it could be later in the discussion and I wanted to pre-note that.)\n\n&gt; lastly i dont think rubio has a chance at all. the republican\'s have long since been using the southern strategy and they\'ve attracted a base that is a fairly racist. they\'re not going to vote a latino, even if he\'s from their party, to presidency.\n\nI think this is a misapplication of assessments. Republicans have shown they\'re more than willing to elect minorities that follow the party-line on issues. Bobby Jindal, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Brian Sandoval, Susana Martinez, Mia Love, Will Hurd, Allen West, Ral Labrador...\n\nAnd that\'s not touching on the big unelected republicans that get lots of support, like Ben Carson, Collin Powell, or Condoleezza Rice. Or hell, look at Romney -- he didn\'t lose any noteworthy support with evangelical voters despite being a Mormon.\n\nRepublicans will happily support people of whatever background -- just as long as they\'re "right" (to the republican voter) on the issues. Racism today is systemic and passive, rather than individual and active: where the republican party is racist is via their policy stances and as a magnifier of already existing dislike -- not through large-scale inherent outright rejection of someone for their race or ethnicity.\n\nOn the flipside, I\'m not going to argue that Rubio is going to *gain* any significant hispanic support just because he himself is hispanic. He\'ll be opposed by the majority of them for the same reason the majority of republicans would support him: his policy stances.\n\n&gt; as for rubio\'s charisma i\'m not so sure. he has the same charisma as romney, he\'s robotic.\n\nSorry but I can\'t agree with that at all. Watch Rubio in an interview or speaking. I don\'t agree with him or even like him, but he\'s clearly a politician that knows how to speak well for himself. Romney had no ability to relate to people or even pretend he could relate to people: almost every time he spoke he reinforced some negative perception of him. Rubio doesn\'t suffer from that. [Charismatic is perhaps the single most often used adjective to describe Rubio](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/young-marco-rubio-stuns-media-with-his-charisma.html) -- and it\'s not by accident.\n\nFor my $0.02, as a progressive: Rubio is likely the most dangerous republican in the race right now. He has a path to the nomination, and would be able to make a politically valuable contrast with any plausible democratic nominees. He\'s not really significantly less conservative than Cruz or Paul, but he\'s able to *talk* like he is -- and convince people that he is, too. A dangerous skill.'

Lest someone say, but but but, yes Republicans do the same thing. One would have thought that they would have had a fit when Iraq turned out to be a sham, but no they "downvoted" the opposition. But the point is that a powerful machine and loyalists enable parties to do just that. Bush and Obama have come up through a system where they owe the Party. With Bernie he may not deliver, but he has a track record of not being a chameleon and while he\'s running on the Dem ticket he doesn\'t owe them squat. I\'m willing the worst nightmare for the Dems at the top is Bernie winning because they don\'t have strings to pull. Why has Bernie not gotten anything done? Because no one wants him to.

The rhetoric of "stealing votes" cements the monopoly of the Business Party and its two factions.\n\nAnd I know reddit *loves* that CGPGrey video about how first past the post voting makes a two party system "inevitable," but that\'s just not the case. Mexico had a two party system for decades under first past the post, with the dominant PRI and the conservative opposition PAN, then the PRD burst onto the scene and became just as much a major party. Now, the PRI, PAN, and PRD all have shots at the presidency every year and Convergence, Verde, Labor, and New Alliance all have national deputies and senators, with Convergence and Verde each also controlling a state government (Oaxaca and Chiapas, respectively). All with first past the post. These parties aren\'t "stealing" PRI votes, they have just as much a need to win those votes as anyone else. And even with all those parties, you\'ve got a lot of people who are still convinced that none of the parties are good for them (see: EZLN).\n\nA concerted third party movement could win substantial gains. It\'s what the old Socialist Party of America was doing before it was brutally repressed and its leaders imprisoned during the First Red Scare. Run a national figure for president and use that platform to promote local elections, win hundreds of city council and mayoral and representative races, and work your way up while demonstrating your ability to govern (see Milwaukee\'s decades of socialist governance and the building of its infrastructure). But more importantly, since electoralism within the system will never truly change the system, such a party can be used as a platform to organize labor and community mobilization for direct action against the greatest problems of our day.'

Bernie has a track record of consistently pushing for progressive change for years.\n\nIt feels like it's time for a dramatic change, and Bernie may be able to generate enough extra buzz in the election to get more people out to vote.  \n\nRegarding changing voting laws:  I agree.

Look at the actual policies which they advocate, and see if you find that anywhere in either American party. Republicans have been trying to co-opt the Hispanic vote from the Democrats by pandering to Catholic sensibilities, a far cry from actual ethnic nationalism.\n\nThe point is, these are all political parties that exist in Europe, whereas nothing even remotely close to the policies of these parties is being entertained anywhere in America. It is undeniable that there is currently a hard swing to the right all across Europe, with the primary motivator being immigration(invasion).\n\nI also didn\'t even bring up major or ruling parties in Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Austria, and other countries that fall outside the western European sphere of acceptable ideologies. Never will you see a nationalist party in America, the Republicans are thoroughly free-trade globalist, multicultural, mass immigration, interventionists, even if a few cranky voters claim to be against these things.'

aS'&gt;the people who elect people like Romney or whatever right-wing nutjob you want to pick are about as crazy as he is\n\nIs it craziness or indoctrination? I see this as a problem with our education, which in these states is dictated by Republicans attempting to build a loyal voting bloc. Romney is crazy, no doubt, but many of the Republican candidates don\'t believe a word that they say. I\'d wager a fair few Republicans are actually atheists, but they\'ll never tell you. It\'s all about maintaining power through fear and ignorance and poor education is their primary vehicle for this.\n\n&gt;I suppose the whole point of a democracy is that the people are free to make those mistakes at all\n\nYou\'re not wrong, and I\'ve agreed that it has been "worth it" to keep our democracy around for a long time. But... (and I guess this is where I take the leap from liberal to radical/pessimist) ...as a cynical person, I\'m just not convinced anymore that in the long term any sort of significant reform to our current government will be enough to save us as a nation and possibly even a species. \n\nMistakes are just simply not something that we can afford to make anymore. We aren\'t playing with sticks and mud today, we\'re playing with nuclear bombs and planet-wide systems, both man-made and naturally occurring, that we don\'t even fully understand yet. We have to accept that it is both unacceptable for our politicians to support these mistruths, but that it is also unacceptable for them to be held captive by the uneducated who believe in the them. As sorry as I am to have to say it, democracy might not be worth it anymore.'

aS"&gt;I'd wager a fair few Republicans are actually atheists, but they'll never tell you.\n\nI sincerely doubt that. Honestly, as someone with friends who have interned for political campaigns, these candidates are generally just about as crazy as they seem. It's not an act, they actually believe a lot of the stuff they say, or have at least convinced themselves that they believe it.\n\nAnd while you're right that I'm sure there are politicians who say they're religious because it's political suicide not to (especially in general elections), the extreme right-wingers are not among them. They are genuinely religious as fuck.\n\n&gt;As sorry as I am to have to say it, democracy might not be worth it anymore.\n\nI mean this is the whole NSA thing, right? Security, but at what cost? Obviously it's different because domestic spying doesn't actually help, but the point is the same. Yes, we could definitely make great strides as a nation if we switched to a dictatorship where smart, educated people made decisions based on what was best for the country, not what the people wanted. But at what cost? Would the strides forward we could make really be worth the abolition of our free, democratic society? I don't think so. I mean, people here are always ranting about how the United States is supposedly an oligarchy, what would happen if it were *literally* an oligarchy? I don't think people would sit well with that. \n\nIt's possible we'll be the victims of our own ignorance, and destroy our own civilizations by destroying the planet, or some other calamity we brought on ourselves by virtue of the fact that our own voting populace wasn't smart enough to do what was best for us.\n\nBut maybe that's just the cost of a free society. Is it better to be free to make mistakes, and suffer the consequences of those mistakes, no matter how severe? Or is it better to let an elite few make decisions for us, and hope that they do what's right. I don't know the answer to that."

aS"Again, we're not on the same page. These *are* fringe politics in American culture *because* the political parties are monolithic. That's my point entirely. The tail wags the dog.\n\nIn European politics (because of the parliamentary system) it is possible for small political parties like Front National with 13% of the vote to be legitimate parties. This would never happen in American politics. They would simply get co-opted by either side like the Tea Party was absorbed by the Right.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that American politics has been corrupted into a one-size-fits-all mess where all the issues are absorbed into an ocean that is divided by the absolute minimal difference, namely the conservative movement and the progressive movement.\n\n&gt; You're making ridiculous assumptions from the opening paragraphs of a wikipedia page. Look at the actual policies which they advocate, and see if you find that anywhere in either American party. Republicans have been trying to co-opt the Hispanic vote from the Democrats by pandering to Catholic sensibilities, a far cry from actual ethnic nationalism.\n\nYou're missing the woods for the trees by delving into the minutia. That's not what this conversation is about. It's about the fact that American politics has evolved into a beast that doesn't allow for parties to exist outside of the big two. In Europe the very fact that you're even *able* to have a reactionary party shows just how far Right American politics is because here we can't do that. American politics has become *so* conservative that the establishment hasn't just shifted to the Right during the past forty years but it has effectively become a single party. The Democrats have largely forgotten their old policies on higher taxes on the wealthy and affordable education and now the only thing that really differentiates them from the Right are their social policies.\n\nWhat really explains your understanding of all this to me however is this:\n\n&gt; ...the Republicans are thoroughly...multicultural, mass immigration...\n\nThat's simply not true. It seems that you have a completely different take on where the pulse of the Right in America currently is. That's probably why you see this so differently."

aS'No. Certainly a third party candidate in a system like ours does have the potential to harm the political candidate from a mainstream party that is closest to them, but the bigger issue for Gore was that many Democrats were very frustrated with Bill Clinton\'s neoliberal third way policies and Gore campaigned as a continuation of that, not as a left candidate. All of his climate change activism didn\'t come until after the election was over. At that time was also the height of the fair trade/anti-glob protests, which started under Clinton and were much larger and more intense than occupy. Meanwhile, George Bush was campaigning as a centrist, nothing like how he ended up once in power. So, Gore lost voters since less turned out to vote and even some registered Democrats voted for Bush, maybe thinking he would roll back on the neoliberalism (nothing to do with "liberal" as used in the US). More registered Democrats voted for Bush than Nader. And iirc, quite a few registered Republicans voted for Nader (meaning their votes didn\'t go to Bush, so in that case, they weren\'t helping Bush by voting for Nader).\n\nAlso, Sanders is running under the Democratic Party, not Independent (as he is in Vermont).

She is double digits ahead of ANY other potential presidential candidate, on EITHER side. \n\nShe\'s only hated by extreme Republicans because she\'s high profile and the Democrat front runner, it\'s not like the far right of the Republican party is going to start loving Sanders, a self described socialist/social democrat if he gets the nomination. They don\'t hate him only because they\'ve never given him a thought before. On policy, Clinton has A LOT more appeal to moderate Republicans than Sanders does. Sanders will get zero Republican votes, Clinton could actually well pick up a fair few moderates, particularly if the Republicans nominate a nutcase (which is entirely possible). Sanders also has the possibility of losing centrist Democrats while left wing Democrats will grudgingly vote for Clinton over a Republican. \n\nMy own political ideals align a lot more closely with Sanders, but my own political ideals are not shared by America as a whole, where the vast majority of people see "socialism" as a dirty word.

With all of this inability to see, they will probably see an opportunity to claim disability benefits for themselves because of blindness. \nPerhaps they just see preditors as being the ones that should prevent other preditors - but even that could not be classed as seeing things clearly."

aS'GOP supporter here, if you want a serious answer.\n\nThe party is split on whether climate change happens and whether people have caused it. But the scientific disputes are not the issue.\n\nThe issue is that in order to "fix" the problem, according to environmentalists, we essentially have to end capitalism and remake the entire American economy based on a top-down approach (because that always works wonderfully). And that we\'re asking America to cut CO2 emissions when China produces the most in the world.\n\nTo us, the issue is that the "solutions" to the problem seem very politically motivated, and the science can\'t help but seem to us to also be like that at times. Thus you can understand why we\'re skeptical.\n\nAnd before you go on and talk about how crazy all Republicans are, watch "The Day After Tomorrow" and honestly tell me that movie is the epitome of scientific accuracy. This issue has crazies on both sides.'

aS"That's not the way to solve the problem, though. If the conservatives want to be idiots, we just have to let them. It's okay to laugh, but to shame them and demean them, regardless of how much they deserve it, is sinking to their level.  \n  \nIt made the Republicans look like asshats when they were crying out that Obama was a socialist communist Muslim from Kenya without a valid American birth certificate. Name calling is just stooping to their level. Instead of joining the shouting match, educate people who don't know any better."

aS'It\'s true, and it not pretty, believe me.  Look, all I\'m saying is I don\'t care if these guys are goofing off or launching rubber chickens in to space just for a giggle and to blow off some steam, as long as it doesn\'t cost the tax payers $5 million dollars to do it, (and they name the chicken "Jerr-Bear").\n\nI think the bigger question we should be asking ourselves is why are the Republicans doing this when they were huge proponents of the space program and "Star Wars" back in the Reagan era?  I personally think the Republicans are more worried about how the democrats have been carelessly abusing technology in a very public way that they worked hard to discover and have more responsibly kept secret, thus the international Cold War arms race, (i.e. when everyone has super power capabilities no one wins).  \n\nI think this is more about protecting the public from the democrats carelessness and abuse of power by demanding accountability and micromanaging everything they do.  If it turns out that the democrats are funding something questionable then it needs to be curtailed, immediately.'

aS"Yup, I used to be as conservative as they came but I'm done with the GOP. I voted for Ted Cruz because I thought he was limited government and even Ron Paul backed him. I still consider that one of my most regrettably decisions in my short life. Seriously. \n\nThe Republicans are treating their voters like they treat the economy and environment, they clear cut both for their own gain and refuse to put anything back into it. The only thought is How much can we harvest from these things for our own benefit. I've never voted Democrat but I've been in love with Bernie Sanders after I took my first visit to Vermont 5 years ago. That state knows what it is doing. If Sanders wants to Co very some Republicans that are sick of their party he should talk about Vermont's gun laws. Everyone thinks Texas has the most lenient gun laws... Not a chance, Vermont is miles ahead of us. "

aS"&gt; Senator Marco Rubio of Florida praises his parents, a bartender and a Kmart stock clerk, as he urges audiences not to forget the workers in our hotel kitchens, the landscaping crews in our neighborhoods, the late-night janitorial staff that clean our offices.\n\nMaybe he should include his fellow Republican lawmakers in his audience, because they certainly have forgotten the middle class when it comes to anything other than campaigning.\n\n\n&gt; But now, Mr. Norquist said, Republicans should move past that. Focus on the people in the room who know someone who couldnt get a job, or a promotion, or a raise because taxes are too high or regulations eat up companies time, he said. The rich guy can take care of himself.\n\nPeople can't get these things precisely because the rich guy is taking care of himself.  The ones impacted by the high taxes Republicans are concerned with are the rich.  Either the middle class has to make up revenue lost because Republicans want to eliminate taxes like the millionaire estate tax, or the middle class loses out on public programs that help them scrape by."

p329
aS'So according to you the onus is obviously on me, yet as I said, it was you who originally made the statement.\n\nYou seem to be arguing from your own socialist perspective, from which socialism is primarily an economic concern (I had read some of your other posts). You seem mostly concerned that the super rich aren\'t paying for the education and healthcare that would boost the very poor. This is one marginal issue for which I care very little, and agree with on some scale. I should point out that I am Canadian, and appreciate being able to be injured without also being bankrupted. To clarify, this is your original statement:\n&gt;the right is pretty much the entire main stream spectrum\n\nCompared to Europe, there are facets of American politics that make less concessions to the welfare-state model practiced by most European countries. That only puts America on the right of the "mainstream" spectrum in your perspective, as what constitutes the mainstream in America has been pushed so far to the left that it doesn\'t remember what the right is. If your mainstream spectrum starts at global socialism and ends at economic unions of liberal democracies, than America may appear as a conniving fascistic demon. As I have repeatedly said, our viewpoints are so different that we do not even percieve terms in any familiar way.\n\nI am arguing from a perspective where, specifically *marxism*, refers to the destruction of traditional elements of society so that way can be repaved for society to be reconstructed on these egalitarian(cough) redistributionist principles, and that to believe this dream can be realized and isn\'t a vehicle for an already privileged elite to consolidate their power and wipe out competitors isn\'t as I said akin to a street gang, is denial. So when we look at things like corporate revenues, we see an arm of this privileged elite that isn\'t playing by the rules that are dictated by all the lawyers and committees at their behest. The slice of the pie that should be allocated to regional governments is instead paid up to a "boss" at a higher level than US politics. Governments are run by individuals, who have always been more powerful than supposed collectives. Suggesting we hand over power exclusively to a single, small collective puts power in the hands of less individuals, and the inevitable result has been the so called testing of communism in every country that has tried it. Look at the rise of cartels in Latin America and Mafias in Eurasia. These cartels are the beneficaries of regulation, they are in essence parallel governments with their own methods of policing their own regulations, and are only held accountable when their enemies use the same strategies. The same goes for business conglomerates that owns swathes of the world economy. The strategy is simple, appeal to the poorest for help bringing down their rising competitors. We have proof this is how the world operates and it\'s called the entirety of written history.\n\nWhat is presented by the elites as mainstream alternatives are completely controlled, and I agree that forays into various religious and minority rights are a massive distraction from the complete domination of our planet by those at the very top. The only modern difference is that the real people at the top, the ones with the money and power and connections to change the world are no longer kings, popes, emperors, and aristocrats, they are largely non-public faceless suits with secret bank accounts hiding behind boards and committees in gated estates worlds away. If this sounds like it has a conspiratorial slant to it, it does, you can never take your enemies at their word, especially if they have something to lose by telling the truth. \n\nOur perspectives have such a large difference in source and spirit that it would probably be completely futile and even trigger a complete shutdown of reasonable debate if I were to bring the to connection to international Jewry. That you are surprised such a progressive publication as the New York Times is a tool for shaping political narrative for neocons is again illustrative of the huge divide between our perspectives. The neocons are not right wing, they are the antithesis to the right wing, they seek to reinforce the established hegemony of international finance\'s stranglehold over developing countries. The "fringe right wing", which in your perspective is so far right that it is not worth considering as part of the political spectrum, seeks a complete divorce from such international meddling on behalf of international actors. We seem to both agree that Democrats and Republicans are puppets of our real enemies, yet you are taking the word of the puppet\'s puppets as evidence of actual public opinion.\n\nMy definition of marxism is that of Churchill\'s that it is a **world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality.**\n\nTo distill my opinion in that of the gang metaphor, I would prefer to see power diffused as widely as possible across as many small gangs as possible, rather than concentrated amongest one gang so as to police its errant subjects. Marxism/socialism is a dream fueled by capricious envy which will never realize the former, it is simply a vehicle for the latter.\n\nEDIT: And to reinterate a point from a thread long ago, oligarchs are not nationalists, at most they are demagogues.\n\n2ND EDIT: is*'

aS'Denmark is not fine. Denmark has a below replacement fertility rate, and the fertility rate of the Danish people, as in those who are ethnically and culturally Danish, is even lower. They are currently going extinct - mainly because they have adopted a particular set of values. This phenomenon is not limited to Europe. Nine out of the ten states with the lowest fertility rates - also below replacement - are blue states, and nine out of the ten with the highest are red. Liberals, no - *white* liberals - are big on self extinction. It\'s no surprise that they see this controversy from the perspective they do. Raising the next generation honestly just isn\'t that high on the list of priorities.  \n\nMy point is that people can, with good intentions and in good faith and without any malice at all, oppose extending state recognition to gay marriage. It doesn\'t mean you hate gay people and want them ridiculed back into the closet. It might just mean that you\'re apprehensive about tinkering with something as important as marriage, an institution that is already on the ropes thanks to every previous liberal offensive into this arena.  \n\nAt any rate, some 40% of Republicans are just fine with gay marriage. Of the remainder, I\'m sure there are some homophobes. But to say that it\'s the objective of the Republican Party that we return to a time when "gays are ridiculed and forced to keep a secret instead of living life as who they are and contributing to the greater good of society" is just hyperbolic. That\'s a fringe position. If you think that\'s what mainstream Republicans believe, I hate to break it to you, but you\'re the ignorant, stereotyping bigot.  '

aS"You're using an incredibly outmoded definition which is simply not an accurate baseline in today's zeitgeist. If my fault is that my mainstream spectrum starts at global socialism and ends at economic unions of liberal democracies then yours would be that your mainstream spectrum starts at the subverted rights of the individual and ends with the rise of Nietzsche's Superman.\n\nIf that is your metric then you've reduced all of human history to one grand, continuous conspiracy where the only thing that changes are the faces.\n\nYou say things like this:\n\n&gt; We seem to both agree that Democrats and Republicans are puppets of our real enemies, yet you are taking the word of the puppet's puppets as evidence of actual public opinion.\n\nand then never expand on them. How do *you* gauge public opinion? Of course the New York Times is part of the establishment. You don't think I understand that but I do. But on top of that, I recognize that the press has throughout history generally been to the left of the state. I also understand is that living as both an absolutist and an ideologue is impossible.\n\nYou're right. The world will never be fair and people will never realize the extent to which everything is controlled but your standards come from a place of such naivety that you cut yourself off from any and all discussion.\n\nYou want to diversify power and think that there's currently one big room with a few people controlling the entire world. You're right in some ways and wrong in others. Sure, there is an incredibly tiny amount of people controlling everything but they're *not* always all sitting in the same room making secret deals and agreements in the way you think they are. Of course treaties are made, laws are passed secretly, borders are negotiated and quid pro quo is par for the course. But these elites do it to themselves too. Competition has always been far too great for a single cabal to control the way you think they do.\n\nYou bring up international Jewry like it's one huge secret that only you and the White Aryan Resistance are keen to. I know that Israel wags the dog of the U.S., Hollywood, Wall Street, and the U.N., among others but I also know that they're just the flavor of the century and there are far too many cogs in the wheel for it to be on purpose. Israel runs on guilt and are really the first state to exist in such a unique fashion. But you know what? Israel's power will wane in time when people grow tired of its politics or the Middle East runs out of oil. That's how these things go.\n\nBut I'm also careful to know when and how to keep my concerns in check. They don't have the sort of power you deftly imply they do. I mean that's quite a roundabout way to horde all the gold, isn't it?: let's subvert the governments of all of Europe and most of the other positions in the world through finance and then when the time is right secure the Third Temple but only give ourselves one of the tiniest scraps of land in the Middle East with no oil. It's ridiculous.\n\nPeople take as much as they can as fast as they can wherever they can. History has shown this. People don't *want* to play the long game. They want it *now*. That is one of the reasons why conspiracies are so unrealistic.\n\nSo although I wish you had more substance in the form of articles, or evidence to back up your claims that a cabal runs the world and I further wish you had addressed directly what I had asked of you, I thank you for indulging me, as painful as it must have been I'm sure."

Just about every modern country on earth is dealing with the youth bubble. Who says it\'s a bad thing anyways?

I don\'t think letting gay people marry has had, or will have any significant influence on that.

His big issue is finance reform. At least, that is what you will hear about in news articles mostly.\nThere are even a few moderate Republicans who are for some of those issues. With the exception of corporations, you will hear the same arguments from Clinton. If Warren decides to run, and that's a big if, you will hear those exact same issues coming from her. You're going to hear those same issues from O'Malley as well. My question is, so what? I like Sanders and all, I do. But it doesn't change that he is way more liberal than what America wants. \n\nForgetting his age for a moment, the main problem is that Sanders wants more regulation. A lot more government regulation. Whether it's drugs, climate change, education, the IRS, unions, health care, raising the minimum wage, Sanders is all for more regulation. And voters HATE that. He's a socialist through and through and you will hear that again, and again, and again. You will mostly hear it from the media. You will hear it from republican pundits. You will hear it from people who have NO CLUE what it is, but there is such a negative connotation that is associated with socialism it will instantly put skeptical cynicism into those who do not know much about him. \nIt also doesn't help that Sanders is being heavily funded by unions. Sure there are those, like myself, who really support unions and everything they do. I strongly believe that people are better off paying union dues and being in one. But right to work laws are tense issues, and the moment someone says he is being funded by unions it could quickly turn off moderate voters. \n\nAgain, everything you listed are issues. I agree with you on that. But that doesn't make him special.

aS"...What? Sheldon Richman is not a socialist. Even if he were, it would make no difference. The laissez-faire nature of the Gilded Age is only considered mythical by fringe libertarian groups. Like Richman for example, who points to the benefits of increased economic growth as the result of market competition, and the negative features of the time, like extreme worker abuse, on government regulation. This is nonsense according to any honest interpretation of the facts.\n\nNo one suggests that the Gilded Age is an example of a perfectly free market. That would be nonsense. However it was certainly the most laissez faire period of American history and was marked by a *lack of involvement and regulation* by government in the activities of business in most industries, whether it was coal mining, steel and iron work, textiles, logging, etc. In these industries you saw an extreme lack of consideration for the well being of working people, and a lack of desire on the part of government to do anything about it. Very few pieces of legislation were passed in this time.\n\nThe notion that if only the market was *more free* during this time of plentiful unskilled labor, normal working people would have been better off, goes against the most basic principles of economics. The market is a machine that will steamroll people if the conditions warrant it, and they often do.\n\n&gt; The political situation in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th Century was a gridlock, very much as it has been recently. Even though Republicans won three of the five Presidential elections between 1876 and 1896 they did not win a majority of the popular vote in any of them. There were only four years when Republicans controlled both the White House and both houses of Congress. There were only two years when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House. Government simply was not a factor in the economy during this time.\n\n&gt;When there was a panic in the financial markets, like the one in 1893 that led to a depression for the entire second term of President Grover Cleveland, J.P. Morgan, the head of the most powerful Wall Street bank, stabilized the banking system by putting his firm's capital into the market to prevent some banks from failing. The government had no authority, means, or will, to act. Morgan also intervened in the same way in the 1907 bank panic that resulted in a protracted recession that finally prompted the first effort to regulate the banks through the creation of the Federal Reserve System. However, the structure and powers of the Federal Reserve System were designed by bankers, meeting in secret, at a Morgan estate.[8]\n\n&gt; It was during the second half of the 19th Century that laissez-faire industrial capitalism became dominant and known by that term.  Laissez-faire meant leave business alone, and business was left alone by the government until early in the 20th Century. The concept is popularly believed to have come from Adam Smith whose Wealth of Nations,[9] first published in 1776, greatly influenced economic thought in the 19th Century. He argued that business operated most effectively and efficiently when guided by what he called the invisible hand of market forces.[10] That concept was misinterpreted as advocating laissez-faire, essentially a complete absence of government regulation, or involvement in business, which Smith did not advocate. And the term laissez-faire never appears in his work. However, using Smith as the authority, laissez-faire was converted by various thinkers into a philosophical underpinning of capitalism and the free enterprise system, as if it were an essential element.\nhttp://m.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/11/1320673/-The-2nd-Industrial-Revolution-the-Gilded-Age-Laissez-Faire-Capitalism-Social-Darwinism\n"

aS"Well in a world in which Bernie wins, I think the tea party and radical conservatism would be minimized if not destroyed in the process as disillusioned Republicans swing left and Democrats swing farther left to Bernie. That would leave a far left political caucus of voters, a moderate left central caucus, and a conservative caucus. If Bernie were to win and run again, he'd probably do it as a 'democratic-socialist' and start a third party, like Canada has had."

aS"&gt; From my view I can't see how he's done anything for me, Republicans at least aren't trying to take anymore more away from me as I see it.\n\nAlso, you should be aware of the fact that unless you're a super rich perosn, the Republicans have overseen arguably the greatest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in US history. So when you say Republicans arent taking anything from you, you are intensely wrong. Their policies shift the burden from high earners to low earners for everything that makes society function. Your hard earned money is going toward paying for things that until recently society agreed the rich ought to pay most for. You sound like an intelligent guy, but you also sound as if you've been duped. The cold hard facts are that wealth has been siphoned en masse away from the middle class of American and into the coffers of the rich, and that Republican policies have been the lubricant along the way. Simple. Facts. Are dems perfect? Absolutely not. But their policies are much more similar to the ones we had in place after WWII when we had a drastically more equitable distribution of wealth, and accordingly the country was far more stable economically.

aS'OK, maybe I over-generalized, but would saying "Most are the kind who believe they should have the ability to work hard and not have higher taxes" isn\'t exactly true either -- there are more social conservatives than fiscal conservatives. \n\n&gt;  I believe the tax percentage should be the same all the way\n\nThis would seem to be a pretty crucial difference. If anything Bernie is for even more progressive taxation. A flat tax would be regressive.\n\n&gt; and thats what makes most moderate republicans republicans.\n\nHmm. That might be true. I don\'t know how what the statistical breakdown of moderate Republicans are. \n\nI will say, it isn\'t just the media that gives your party a bad name though. Maybe not all Republicans are the same, but the ones at the extremes are very loud. '

aS'I AM a conservative. And, yes, my voting record is unanimously Republican.\n\nI\'m so conservative that I can\'t stand most of the Republican party. The party leadership is too left of center for me. \n\nWhat\'s the old English saying? "If you go far enough east, you\'re west."\n\nSometimes mutually opposed groups can find common ground in weird ways. Ever hear a black nationalist rant about how African-Americans need to get out of America? They sounds shockingly like neo-Nazis (insofar as both groups want blacks to leave). The same thing happened in World War II where the World Zionist Congress actually worked with the Nazis because they both had aligned interests: Getting Jews to leave Europe.\n\nBefore the Final Solution, Hitler toyed with sending Jews to Palestine. The World Zionist Congress--in this pre-Holocaust period--had been working toward the same goal for decades. So when Hitler started making things uncomfortable for Jews, there were Zionists who actually welcomed it--because it might trigger a mass exodus from Europe (which is what they wanted).\n\nSo in this bizarre paradox, for a brief period, both Nazis and Jews were working toward the same goal. (Of course things went off kilter when England forbade the deportation of Jews to Palestine. They didn\'t want to destabilize the region after taking it over from the Ottomans.)\n\nBut no matter....\n\nIn modern US politics, there\'s occasional overlap between right and left. Both leftist civil rights groups and rightwing civil libertarians want more freedom. They also have a deep distrust of crony-capitalism. They both also have a deep populist streak to them.\n\nThis is why Ron Paul initially poached so many young Democrats. They liked his pro-freedom, anti-war message.\n\nToday, conservatives who are pro-freedom and anti-war are called paleo-conservatives. We were the anti-internationalists (while the Democrats were historically the internationalist party). The Democrats wanted to involve the US in the League of Nations (under Woodrow Wilson) while the Republicans fought it tooth and nail.\n\nConservatives have ALWAYS been anti-war and pro-freedom.\n\nDon\'t ever confuse a real conservative for a neocon chickenhawk. The neocons emerged from the Scoop Jackson branch of the Democratic party.\n\nI consider neocons Democrats.\n\nAlways sabre-rattling and always willing to involve the US in international wars.\n\nJeb Bush is just like them: a RINO (Republican in Name Only.) 99% of his political positions are the same as Hillary Clinton\'s. \n\nI\'d prefer Bernie Sanders because we have aligned interests insofar as 1) He\'s anti-Too Big To Fail. To me socialism for Wall Street is still socialism. When companies behave recklessly, I believe that they should be allowed to go out of business. Their deaths would stand as object lessons for other companies considering shady practices. 2) He\'s for civil liberties. 3) He\'s populist and believes in placing working Americans first.\n\n\n'

It turns out that was exactly the point I was trying to make. I'm glad you picked it up so clearly. \n\nCurbing the DOD- well, I wouldn't phrase it that way, but I think many people would be happy to see our allies defend themselves for a while. But if you are blaming liberals for overspending on defense I think you must either be very confused, or so far to the right that you consider Republicans to be liberals. \n\nOn the next point- you want to dry up credit and crash the economy in order to encourage spending.

He adamantly opposed everything "Obama" .  The passion that Wisconsin\'s voter base had been waiting for. (remember the old lady from WI who professed to John McCain that  senator Obama was an arab) well they got this Walker guy elected.  The gravy trains flowed in for corporate beasts as the desolation for regular folks grew and good paying jobs started to dissappear. More people were working full or part-time for low wages and when they had a day off they were applying for foodstamps and badgercare. Well then one day some liberal called up the governor\'s office to play a joke and said he was a Koch brother (can\'t remember which one)  to his surprise walker was greatful to speak with his corporate overlord and pledged his allegiance.  And they caught it on tape! The liberals had him churned the recall elections around the corner and whether or not anyone cared,  on that day only the Republicans came out to vote.  As if the liberals were going to let a Muslim run this country AND IMPEACH their hero.  Their Governor. The way I see it the Dems didn\'t care enough to follow through and the few Republicans who kissed his ass and kissed the asses of his asskissers and so forth beat the odds and Walker won again.  Now that he\'s turned Wisconsin into Alabama, he got bored of being a governor and he\'s off flying around the world to kiss ceo ass and do interviews because in \'Murica you can drop out of higher education to work a telemarketer job and then become the next president elect.

Either that or she\'s incompetent as a lawyer herself, has shitty lawyers to advise her, can\'t possibly manage two different email accounts at once, but somehow is the very best candidate for President of the United States. Your choice. \n\n&gt;By the way if you took the time to actually read your own source you would see she acted within full accordance with the law. \n\nYou\'re of course missing the fact that that\'s her lawyer speaking, who is obligated to always work in her best interest. \n\nWhat part of "..willfully and unlawfully conceals.." do you not understand?\n\n'

By the Progressives winning some seats in the state legislature (and Sanders, of course), it shifts the entire political spectrum! Democrats move to the left and Republicans moderate themselves.\n\nWe saw a similar shift with Ross Perot\'s 1992 presidential run. Perot\'s main campaign platform was fiscal responsibility and a balanced budget. The billionaire Perot bought 19% of the vote but he still lost badly. The result? Perot pressured both halves of our ruling political duopoly to act on the issue to negate Perot; this resulted in Clinton\'s balanced budgets.\n\nWill this mean that some "lesser evil" candidates lose elections?\n\nYes, but as the old saying goes, you\'ve to to break some eggs to make an omelette. What those losses will mean is that their future candidates shift to co-opt the so-called "third party".

Ron Paul shook it up a little in the Primaries last time, kinda like Perot did in the 90\'s, but Rand Paul has already shown how much of a sellout he is. People that want change *but don\'t really understand* will vote for Rand if he survives the Republican Primaries, and he would be more of a threat to Hiliary or Bernie, just like Perot drew away folks that couldn\'t stand Bush, like me.

With one move they\'ll be able to destroy one of the largest unions in the country *and* hand over billions to their overlords.  And as a bonus, we get yet another example of how the government is a failure at anything it tries to do, and how every aspect of society needs to be privatized.  \n\nIf you\'re one of the people out there who doubt that Bernie Sanders is who he says he is, here you go.  While the rest of Washington is slowly bought out by the 1%, Sanders is becoming a clear example of an honest politician who isn\'t afraid to stand up the the corporate elite.

aS"In another comment I mentioned : \n\n&gt;I don't think both parties are the same, and last time I checked the Senate had a Republican majority. Democrats aren't immune to the influence of money in politics (Who is Wallstreet backing?) but they frequently don't target the middle class and poor in the same way or ignore facts because it's convenient for business.\n\nAt any rate though, that doesn't change the damaging influence money has in politics even for the Democrats. Obama has ties to Goldman Sachs and other Wallstreet firms. Guess who wasn't punished when they caused the financial system to melt down? \n\nThat wiped out lots of people's savings, caused them to lose their jobs, etc. It was severely damaging to the middle class and poor. Some of the kids from that era just entering the work force will never, ever recover from it because jobs were lost forever or retained by baby boomers who lost their nest eggs. They also have massive debts to pay off. The wealthy of course walked away just fine and dandy, if not richer now than ever.\n\nMeanwhile you have the TPP getting rammed down our throats and the Democrats as a whole are either supporting it, or doing nothing about it. There's Warren and Sanders who are publicly against it, but they are more liberal and progressive than the usual Democrat. The Democratic party now has everyone but the far right authoritarians and pseudo-anarcho-capitalists in it, and that's a lot of different political views.\n\nYes, the Democrats aren't pissing on NASA or denying simple scientific facts but there are still people in the party who are accomplices to the dirty things big business and the wealthy are doing in this country. We have a serious problem that crosses party lines here, and that is big money influencing politics. We need serious progressive reform, and I do think that this can only come from within the Democratic party. The Republicans are too far gone down the runaway right-winger path, they're self-entitled ingrates, and they're proud to basically not use their critical thinking abilities in favor of some quasi-common-sense that ends up being pure lunacy."

If Obama had started with this stuff right out of the gate it would have just been a fact of the situation by the time ACA negotiations were going on, no reason it would change any blue dog opinions on the bill."

She supports a raised minimum wage, universal pre-k education, and mandatory maternity and paternity leave. \n\nI mean, if you base your vote on Hillary\'s opinions of video games from 2005, good on you I guess, but I\'m primarily interested in: Economy, Energy, Role of the Federal Government.\n\nWe can\'t let republicans trash the economy with massive unfunded tax cuts _again_! We can\'t finish the process of adjudicating our role as technological leader in energy! Minimum wage is already lower than it\'s been in half a century against inflation... and shrinking: the poor and middle class are barely holding on here. We can\'t survive a radical conservative, not without the immolation and phoenixing that the radicals worship. \n\nRemember the Republicans universally disagree with every point above. Deny climate science, get rid of EPA protection, stop incentivizing alternative energy, give the bank away to the oil companies. Allow mega-mergers, cut corporate taxes. Income inequality is radically increasing? Cut taxes on the top 0.01%! They want (and are getting closer) to destroying healthcare reform and reducing our system to their  true goal of "care only for those who can pay (read: basic capitalism)" . They have no solution for the twelve million illegal immigrants except to continue to the disgusting status quo of second-class citizens. And biggest of all, Republicans want to slash social spending and cut taxes, so they can destroy welfare while continuing the deficit, so they continue to use the deficit as justification to end national spending in sciences, national spending for alternative energy, national spending on education, and of course, national spending on welfare and income inequality. They\'re already slashing budgets like NASA and illegalizing the mention of climate change, and putting low-iq faith leaders in positions of power over the sciences. \n\nI just hope you realize that Republicans control Senate and without a Democrat in the White House, we are going to see radical conservative policy become National Law. That "disagreeing with Snowden" is going to be the least of your worries during the second gilded age, after the minimum wage is abolished all together and healthcare is rendered into a full pay-for-service-upfront only system. \n\nYou can harp on Snowden and violent video games, but losing more to income inequality, losing Social Security, the EPA, gay civil rights, and a thousand more important things are on the line.\n\nI won\'t be voting for Hillary in the primaries, but I still recognize rightfully that she\'s radically better than any Republican, including Bush. \n\n'

aS'Well, since you ask so nicely.\n\nOverall: The premise is that had Bernie decided to challenge Shumlin for the Gubernatorial office, he could have used that position as a base to build a statewide Progressive Party analogous to the organization he built in Burlington.  That\'s unlikely, and here is why:\n\n- All Vermont politics is intensely personal.  Bernie has a strong *personal* following (he\'s not a nice guy, but he\'s widely seen as honest and straightforward), rather like a fiscally conservative Republican Governor, Richard Snelling.  Snelling was downright rude, abrasive and difficult to deal with.  But he kept getting elected, and when he retired he was succeeded by a liberal Democrat (Madeline Kunin) who proceeded to muck up the budget.  Snelling came back and fixed it again with a stunning deal between him and the powerful Democratic leader of Congress.  It was Snelling\'s unexpected fatal heart attack that put then Lt. Governor Howard Dean - remember him? - into the Governor position.  Dean, brilliantly, immediately announced that he hadn\'t been elected to anything, was going to implement Snelling\'s program and leave Snelling\'s people in place in the government.  Vermonters thought this was pretty classy and re-elected Dean in his own right with a massive majority.  So Vermont had a very fiscally conservative (and rude) Governor, followed by a Liberal (and wishy washy - she was known as "Straddlin\' Madeline") spendthrift, followed by a "Jeezum Crow, I gotta clean up the f*cking mess *again*?" return, followed by a moderate Democrat who acted like a conservative Republican and fought tooth and nail with the Progressive wing of his own party.  Dean called them "kooks" and "nutcases" and "idiots" - and that was in public.  Do you see strong ideologies at play here?  Me neither.\n  \n -  The takeaway here is that Vermont politics is not so much ideology based as personality based.  People like Bernie and trust him, but outside of the enclaves of the Progressive Party, notably Greater Burlington and a few other cities, the PP doesn\'t have a lot of traction.\n\n- On Shumlin\'s failures as Governor (labeled betrayal).  Shumlin did come in promising single payer health care in Vermont.  It was to be the centerpiece of his administration.  Very unfortunately, the launch of the Vermont health care portal - a custom programming job for goodness sake, so that it could be unique to Vermont - was a much bigger disaster than the Federal portal.  It still doesn\'t work, and the Governor has said if it\'s not fixed by the end of May, it\'s going to be scrapped and Vermont will just use the Federal software. (Or maybe not.  There\'s been some hemming and hawing about this.  Heads have rolled, but not Shumlin\'s.)\n\n  -   We spent millions and millions on the custom site.  That\'s enough to piss everybody off, just to start with, and is one big reason that Shumlin came very very close to losing his seat in the last election.\n\n -    Shumlin had already annoyed the Legislature by refusing to discuss how the single payer plan was to be financed.  Various Democrats (and the exceptionally weak for now) Republicans kept asking, before the election, "Ummm.  Pete?  How we gonna pay for this?  What will it cost?  We\'d kinda like to know, if you don\'t mind."  After the election, the Administration came out and said, "Oops.  Sorry.  Too expensive."  The blithe statement that the cost could be covered by "taxing the rich" is just too disingenuous for words.  Remember there are only 600,000 people in the whole state, and the wealthiest tend to be retirees.  They can (and do) establish winter residencies in income tax free Florida but spend summers here.  There aren\'t enough 1%\'ers here to finance single payer.  It would take a broad based payroll tax, and few people were really eager for that.\n\n- Bernie as mayor of Burlington.  Yes, his supporters were called Sanderistas.  He did spend a lot of time and effort talking about Central America.  A famous quote from a disgruntled member of the city council was, "El Salvador!  El Salvador!  What about El Burlington?".  *However* - and it isn\'t something you read a lot about in the hagiography of Sanders - he was very practical and actually listened to the Old Guard that had run Burlington for decades.  He didn\'t always agree, of course, but when he wanted to accomplish something practical for the city, he brought them in and they helped.  He did a lot of good for Burlington and is one of the reasons that it still has a thriving downtown despite the Big Box stores on the perimeter.  And if housing is expensive, there is still some working class housing available.  (Although many people complain it\'s filled with UVM students pushing out the Burlingtonians.  The city keeps hammering on the University to build more on campus housing - it\'s an annual fight.)  Bernie talked a lot about Central America but he still got things done for Burlington.\n\n- Sanders has "uncritically supported the Democrats in Vermont".  Um, yes, but no.  Bernie is not playing on the Vermont stage, he\'s playing on the DC stage.  It\'s often a bad idea for DC politicians to interfere in State level politics, particularly outside of the electoral cycle.  A campaign appearance or two, maybe a pancake breakfast fund raiser here or there, sure.  But Bernie directly attacking Shumlin\'s policies in Vermont would be kind of offensive, even to us Sanders admirers.  "Mind your own business, Bernie" would be the tart reply.\n\n- The Great F-35 fight.  This is a local hot potato.  On the one hand, you have a long standing Air National Guard base in Burlington, Vermont (sent to patrol NYC on 911, no less), which provides a lot of good jobs, and gives tiny little Burlington airport really state of the art avionics, runway clearing (helicopters blow light fluffy snow off sometimes - it\'s fun to watch), and generally make it possible to fly in and out in frequent bad weather.  The F-35s had to be located somewhere, and a mix of upper middle class professions in South Burlington (where the airport is) went all NIMBY on it, aided by the old Left who just generally hate anything military.  After much turmoil, South Burlington voters went with the pro F-35 crowd, as did the entire Vermont Congressional delegation.  The city of Burlington bought out a strip of houses next to the airport just in case the F-35 turns out to be as loud as some shrilly say it is.  I don\'t know and arguments are ongoing.\n\nWell, that turned into a wall of text, even if I tried to restrict myself to the Vermont comments.\n\nTL; DR: The author of this piece misunderstands and misrepresents Vermont politics, and especially as it pertains to Bernie Sanders.'

Or, is the democrat party position, "doesn\'t matter when you came, if you\'re law abiding and had a kid in this country you get to stay." Is the democrat position on immigration that we should have open borders and any and all who make it here have few if any requirements for citizenship?  This is a serious question.  I would also like to hear from Republicans.  Do they want a fully militarized border with full on deportation for any and all here illegally?  Do they want a secondary class of citizenship to perform manual labor at dirt cheap prices?  From a middle class white male (hate away r/politics) I see serious problems from both party\'s position on the issue.  My impression is Dems want unregulated immigration for the votes and cheap labor, and Republicans want a militarized border for gov. contractors and 2nd class citizens for cheap labor for big business.

The magazine restriction, as dumb as it was, was right after Sandy Hook and was shut down. I wish other tragedies had such a tepid response from the 'there oughta be a law' crowd, because then instead of the monstrous Patriot Act we'd have a fairly innocuous (though certainly still dumb) law that mandates door locks and airline ticket purchase restrictions.\n\nNot quite sure why this is the big issue people make it out to be anyways. It's a big issue to me, but only because laws relating to firearms are enforced with criminal law that enhances the prison state, and gun laws are used for sentence enhancement on unsympathetic actors... but most people who are caught up in the gun debate for single issues seem to ignore the other large issues destroying liberty like the drug war and the surveillance state.

Progressives/leftists throwing their support behind centre-right politicians simply because they\'re less bad than Republicans ensures that the only logical move for Democrats is to move farther and farther left in order to peel votes from Republicans. The only way to incentivise real progressive policies is to show Democrats that they don\'t automatically get the progressive vote just by being less evil than Republicans.'

aS'&gt;ever since the Republicans worked to manufacture a financial "crisis"  \n\nThe bill that changed post office pension funding requirements was a broadly bipartisan bill with about the same number of republican and democratic sponsors.  It passed the house and the senate with no opposition from either party.  This wasn\'t a "Republican" effort alone.  \n\n&gt;by forcing them to prefund 100% of their pensions and retirement benefits over the next 75 years!  \n\nThat is not what happened.  What was required was that the post office catch up its pension funding to the net present value of benefits already earned.  It did not require funding future unearned benefits.  This is about how 1/3 of private corporations fund their pensions, and in my opinion how all pensions should be funded.  \n\nThe catch up payments were overly onerous in my opinion.  But that isn\'t really relevant since the post office hasn\'t actually made one since 2010. Even if congress had not tinkered with the pension funding the post office has still been bleeding money.  \n\nOf course an entirely different issue is whether the post office needs or should make money, but that\'s for another day.\n'

aS"And what that all points out of the arbitrary, contradictory position of anti-government Republicans and conservatives. The distinction between state government and federal government is arbitrary, based only upon scale but no true difference in means. The state government has just as much power to become tyrannical and utilize its monopoly on violence against the freedoms of citizens. This glaring hypocrisy is most evident in the conservative knee-jerk support of cops who murder unarmed citizens. I get that local police aren't federal agents, but they simply represent the localized variation of the federal State with a capital S. It is all part of the same entity, but Republicans and conservatives have decided they prefer tyranny of the local to tyranny of the national, which, I guess I can understand that, but if they are hoping to avoid the violence of the State, they ought to be against both. Or for reforming both. But no, no, that's is way out of the question. "

To get there, the budget calls for $4.2 trillion in cuts to benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps over 10 years.

They include cutting Pell Grant scholarships, either by capping the number of recipients or the benefit amount for each recipient; cutting off health insurance to as many as 27 million people covered by either the presidents health care law or Medicaid; and slicing $600 billion from income security programs like school lunches, food stamps, tax credits for the working poor and nutritional assistance to poor mothers.'

It doesn't give any context to the historical funding levels of the programs where funding is being cut. \n\nWhy does this matter?  Because if Program A was scheduled to have a 50% increase in funding but the Republicans change it to a 20% increase, that's not a cut.

Just because someone calls themself a social justice warrior, a libertarian, a *whatever*, doesn\'t mean that they are *that*. And we shouldn\'t take them that seriously.\n\nThat\'s the beauty of Philosophical political stances.\n\n**But that doesnt matter.** because we\'re not talking about that. You\'re putting up an argument to block your failed logic in your previous statements, otherwise known as a [Straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).  In your original statement, you associated Authoritarianism with conservatism. \n\n&gt;Because stop and frisk wasn\'t authoritarian and conservative.\n\nI told you that Authoritarianism does not appeal to Conservatism. \n\n&gt;Yes because conservatives love big government and authoritarianism. Let\'s just ignore their "Don\'t tread on me" flags.\n\nSo, you give authoritarian examples of actions from Republicans. **You** called them Conservatives.\n\n&gt; What president was it again that started the war on drugs which resulted in millions of arrests? Nixon, a conservative. Stop and frisk exploded under Bloomberg.\n\nYou say that since they are authoritarian, they are Conservative. Which is **failed logic.** I can\'t believe I have to repeat myself, but I do.\n\n&gt;I never said that because they were authoritartian (*the correct spelling is "authoritarian"*) they were conservative, I said that they were conservative because they say they were conservative and they were republicans.\n\n...No, you didn\'t. **You simply called them conservative.**\n\nOnce again, proof \n\n&gt; What president was it again that started the war on drugs which resulted in millions of arrests? Nixon, a conservative. Stop and frisk exploded under Bloomberg.\n\nNow, onto the next statement:\n\n&gt;In addition, Republicans are nearly universally recognized as the conservative party in the US (in the modern era).\n\nWikipedia\'s political articles should not be relied upon for broad views of conservatism/liberalism. Instead, let\'s go to debate.org, a neutral platform that relies upon popular views. \n\nhttp://www.debate.org/opinions/does-republican-equal-conservative\n\n82% say No. The highest rated answer: \n\n*Conservative is a certain way of thinking, such as a belief in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense. Conservative beliefs on the role of government are that government should be here to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. Conservative policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems by themselves. The Republicans are a political party.*\n\nSo, we can firmly establish the fact that Republicans are not Conservatives, and those examples you gave are not great examples of Conservatives, regardless if **you** call them conservative or not. Additionally, authoritarianism and conservatism should **not** be associated with one another.\n\n&gt;Also, authoritarian actions from a democrat in no way proves that conservatives are not authoritarian, this is a false dichotomy.\n\nOnce again, you\'re providing the wrong logical fallacy. My argument had nothing to do with that; I was proving your false association of authoritarianism = conservative. I provided examples of a supposed "Liberal" doing authoritarian actions. So, we can conclude that anyone from the  supposed political spectrum can do authoritarian actions, and we shouldn\'t rely upon the labels of Republican or Democrat for authoritarianism. I provided you quotes above. This is another fake argument, or a [strawman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).\n\nOr, it could just be a [lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie). '

aS"&gt;Not exactly. While Hillary is more centrist/right on economic and foreign policy issues she is liberal on social issues, and is not the same as a GOP nut in any sense of the word. As someone else put it: She's different on gay rights, drug policy, incarceration, abortion, women's rights, religion, health care policy, privatization of Social Security, school vouchers, gun rights, taxation of the wealthy, expansion of the military, prioritization of renewable energy, and marijuana legalization. The anti-Hillary hyperbole in this thread is unreal, and that's coming from a Bernie supporter.\n\nYou're lying to yourself if you think she cares about any social issue. How can women or LGBT people get equality if they're being killed by drones? Where was Hillary's compassion for the poor when she was a Walmart board member? I don't very closely follow American politics, but how is Hillary 'different' on any of those issues than other Democrats?\n\n&gt;I'm voting for Sanders too, but will be giving all of my support to Hillary if he doesn't win. The anti-Hillary rhetoric is being heavily promoted by the right (and lots of astroturfs pretending to be liberal) because they know she's capable of defeating them. This tactic they use is what lost of us 2004 by a hair's margin, and you know the disastrous result of that. It is imperative that we prevent Republicans from taking the White House in 2016 and forming a GOP super-majority because Supreme Court nominations will be up. This may be the most important election in the last 3 decades.\n\nThe anti-Hillary rhetoric is being heavily-promoted by the left too. She's another war-mongering capitalist who pretends to give a shit about social issues to pander to people like you. She's not going to make anything particularly worse, like the GOP would, but she's not going to make anything particularly better, like perhaps Bernie would: so, she is a doorway to nothing but the status quo. The only reason to support her is so that the Republicans don't run everything into the ground and cause an apocalypse. Which to you, may seem like a fine enough reason, but if I'm going to support her in this way it's not going to be without a fair amount of 'burns'. "

She found that out the hard way in 2008, despite all the early polls showing she'd win the nomination easily.\n\nThat's the part I don't understand: why do people think she's electable? She isn't. If she wins then a lot of Democrats will see it as the same old business as usual, just another candidate of the billionaire class. Those Democrats will stay home instead of vote for her in the general election, especially since many have neither forgotten nor forgiven her for her campaign tactics in the 2008 primaries. Republicans would probably turn out in record numbers to vote against her, even more so than they would against a self-described socialist like Sanders, strangely enough. That's how much the Republicans hate the Clintons.\n\nPresidential elections usually come down to whether enough Democrats come out to vote. And that's what would doom Hillary. When too many people in your own party dislike you, you have no chance. The extreme example of that was in 1980: Reagan only got 50.8% of the vote, but it was miraculous that Carter managed 41%, given how many Democrats despised him and wanted him gone."

aS'Notice how the bill was killed in the State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee?  Wonder why the bill was even being heard in that committee?\n\nHere\'s why.  Colorado\'s rules of procedure give the leader of each chamber of the legislature the sole judgement on which committee to choose for a bill.  Since the State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee usually has fewer legitimate bills than any other committee, it\'s usually used as the "kill committee".  The leadership will stack it with the most loyally partisan members they can.  Then when a bill like this comes along, where the leadership wants it killed but no one really wants to be on record voting against it (or, where some individual Republicans might have even voted for it!), they\'ll route it to military affairs, where the extremists can kill it in committee, and there\'s no accountability for the rest of the legislature.  No vulnerable Senators from moderate districts have to be on the record as voting against it.\n\nPolitics is fun, isn\'t it?  Yet another reason why, as enlightened as it sounds to say you evaluate candidates based on their personal positions, it\'s also wrong in the case of the legislature.

This policy position is consistent with what they and their corporate masters have always wanted in the U.S. too.\n\nHowever, Republicans have painted themselves into a corner since it is a policy position that the Republican base, and most Americans I would add, do not support.  Hillary went out on a Reaganomic limb by advocating a policy measure that would only serve to magnify the problem of illegal immigration.  Ronald Reagan proved as much when he also proposed and implemented an illegal immigration amnesty.\n\nWhat is it with politicians in both parties who persist in embracing the policy failures of the past?  As Albert Einstein once pointed out..."the definition of insanity is doing the very same thing over and over again, while expecting a different result". '

Is there no point of comparison in the political realm? \n\n&gt; Republicans successfully called all of science into question.\n\nAgain, SERIOUSLY? People who are intelligent enough to discriminate between the smart-sounding and the actually smart can't think critically enough to parse out legitimate scientific evidence, for which, in the case of man-made global warming, there is a TON?! Religious right notwithstanding of course, I mean just regular, secular Republicans. I understand confirmation bias, I understand acknowledging the dangers of climate change would definitely hurt a lot of businesses... but seriously, to deny it altogether is just absolute idiocy, and to conflate that denial with the entire scientific field is, excuse my language, fucking nonsense."

aS'This is a wall o\' text. There\'s a tl;dr below.\n\nNo, that\'s not what I\'m saying. I don\'t give a flaming shit what the opposition thinks of a candidate - regardless of whether we\'re talking about Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders or (for that matter), Walter Mondale or Michael Dukakis. In fact, the way I look at it, the more the right wing hates a candidate, the more likely it is that the candidate will more closely align w/ my perspective. I figure he must be doing something right if those guys are screaming about him.\n\nIt used to be an effective tool. These days not so much. They portray anyone w/ a (D) next to his name as the antichrist. \n\nI\'m saying that while Hillary does have big numbers right now, the Republicans have over a billion dollars, 25 years of opposition research, and 25 years of drumming up lunatic ferver over "scandals" often made up from whole cloth. Republicans aren\'t even limited to telling the truth. They\'ve often shown that they are more than willing (hell, happy to) lie through their teeth to secure/maintain power.\n\nNominating Hillary is playing their game.\n\nLook. I think we have an opportunity here. We have a shot at something. \n\nWhen look at the changes going on in our society - changes that happened so quickly - I am stunned. We\'re talking about changes that I never dreamed I would see in my lifetime.\n\nWhen I was a young man, Anita Bryant was spokesdouche for a right wing religious organization that fought to oppose gay rights. I mean serious air time for these people to shout about homosexuals. They didn\'t want homosexuals to be allowed to be teachers.\n\nLook at what happened to marriage equality.\n\nLook at pot.\n\nWhen I was young, pre-Reagan, I had never heard of a war on drugs. I know now that Nixon started it, but I had never heard of it. There sure was plenty of pot around, though. \n\nThen came Reagan, the real War on Drugs with it\'s attendant decimation of civil rights and laws that targeted African-Americans. The nightly news was chock full o\' young black men being led out of ill-kept houses in chains on their way to unbelievably long prison sentences for possession or distribution of a substance that people on Wall Street used. If caught the Wall St. types caught a slap on the wrist, of course.\n\nToday it\'s legal to possess for recreational use in four states (and maybe DC - depends on how that conservative silliness shakes out). \n\nWe are at a moment here. There is no other way to look at it but as a tidal shift in the body politic. The demographics have long predicted it. \n\nI think we have the opportunity to undo 35 years of GOP buggery of our nation. I think this year we could have our left wing "Reagan". Well, left of where we\'ve been for a long time.\n\nAnd that\'s not Ms. Clinton. While I have much respect for her and her accomplishments, there\'s too much smoke around her for there not to be a fire in there somewhere. Remember, I enthusiastically voted for her husband in \'92. I think they were badly handled in many ways.\n\nOTOH, a comparison of donors &amp; voting records between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Clinton shows a candidate more closely aligned with the ideals that the Democratic Party once represented. In some ways Ms. Clinton does, but in no way does Mr. Sanders not. \n\n**TL;DR:** They\'re both smart. They\'re both capable. No matter who wins the nomination, there will be a GOP shitstorm to face. Bernie is unimpeachable. Hillary is not.'

When in reality, they know it won\'t do that.\n\n&gt; Walker, an all but certain presidential candidate, and legislative Republicans have said for months that a revved up economy, fueled in part by their tax cuts, would lead to more tax money than projected through June 2017 and help them mitigate the education cuts.\n\n[Source.](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/no-hike-in-revenue-estimates-forces-tough-budget-decisions-b99495357z1-302763911.html)\n\nEDIT: Also, my comment was more directed at liberals who think this is not on purpose.

Congress employs too many people to be eligible for the subsidies, but they wanted them anyway.  So they falsified their form.  They did this because they hire more staffers than they can afford to provide them with a decent salary and to cover health care costs.  Hypocrisy at its finest.\n\nThis goes back to Republicans telling Democrats if they think the ACA is so great, Congress should go on the exchanges and put their money where they mouth is.  They politically couldn't say no, so they went on the plan and quickly found that they were not eligible for subsidies and their low paid staffers would have hardship to afford healthcare. So rather than make adjusts to their staffing/pay/etc they falsified their forms and gave themselves subsidies.  If a private company had done this it would be highly illegal. Imagine if Walmart decided to claim it was a small business because they didn't want to skirt the ACA laws.  It would be a pretty big scandal.

I know the concept of \'expanding services\' is anathema to many conservatives, but the rest of the population sees problems that need solving and nobody else doing the solving and demands a solution; that\'s government.  Just telling people to fuck off and solve their own problems isn\'t effective in the long run.\n\n&gt; Trying to say that $275 million over 2 years is going to "haunt" Walker due to slightly lowered economic growth projections both statewide and nationally is fucking ridiculous. It\'s like saying someone making $50k/year is going to be haunted by an increased gas price that costs them an additional fifty cents per day than they thought they would pay.\n\nThere are two points here worth discussing: one, the fact that Walker, like many other non-economist Republicans, seems to have lied when he said that cutting taxes on businesses and the wealthy would lead not only to an explosion of jobs, but **more revenues** than would have been raised if the taxes had remained where they were at.  Both of these points have failed to materialize.  From the article:\n\n&gt; Walker, an all but certain presidential candidate, and legislative Republicans have said for months that a revved up economy, fueled in part by their tax cuts, would lead to more tax money than projected through June 2017 and help them mitigate the education cuts. \n\nTotally wrong.  These guys are just, totally wrong about how these things work.  [The truth is that no serious economist ever believes that revenues after a tax cut will surpass what would have been gained without said cuts.](http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/10/ponnuru-tax-cut.html)  Anyone who claims they will is stunningly ignorant on the subject.  I understand that Walker and the GOP have a vision for Wisconsin and they keep getting elected, so fine; but why lie to the population of the state?  If you\'re going to cut taxes, don\'t pretend it won\'t lead to further cuts in spending, if you want a balanced budget.  It absolutely will.\n\nWhat\'s \'haunting\' Walker here is that his and the legislature\'s lies are being revealed.  They sold the tax cuts on the idea that they would be balanced out with additional revenue from the cuts themselves.  That was a lie and they either knew it when they said it, or they are idiots who know nothing about economics.  I would respect the Wisc. GOP a lot more if they were simply honest and up-front about what they want to do, instead of constantly hiding what they want to do by saying one thing during election time, and turning right around and doing something else when in office.\n\nSecond, your example about a 50 cent increase in gas prices per day \'haunting\' someone making $50k/year is actually a bad example.  We\'re talking about $180 in increased costs over the year, which yeah, isn\'t much when compared to $50k.  But!  We\'re not actually comparing it to the whole $50k, we\'re comparing it to the amount of discretionary spending that\'s available to that person.  Increased gas costs can\'t be balanced out by cutting your rent, cutting your insurance payments, cutting your car payment, or a whole host of other activities which are akin to \'mandatory\' spending for an individual.  Not without incurring a LOT of pain and likely additional hassle or costs elsewhere.\n\nIt\'s far more accurate to compare that $180 to about $5k, which is the likely discretionary budget for that person.  That\'s about 3% of the budget, which isn\'t much, but when you\'re already in debt and deficit, it\'s very Not Helpful.  '

Even [Reason magazine's polling](http://reason.com/assets/db/14103737896515.xlsx) shows 36% of Americans having a favorable opinion of 'Socialism', and less than a third having a 'very unfavorable' opinion of it (slightly over a third, if you consider likely voters). Including nearly 1 in 5 self-identified Republicans, and slightly over 1 in 5 self-described Conservatives (and nearly 40% of self-described Moderates). Even a quarter of self-identified Tea Party supporters reported having a favorable opinion of 'Socialism' - the word, with no definition provided.\n\n&gt; And there are people who will vote for Hillary just because she's a woman and might vote Republican otherwise.\n\nThere are also people who will vote against Hillary just because she's Hillary.

aS'&gt;Yes a path to citizenship, everyone in America supports a path because almost everyone here comes from immigrants\n\nIt would be nice if that\'s true, but it\'s not.  Most Republicans have been blocking anything even remotely close to a path to citizenship, calling it "amnesty".\n\n\n&gt;She was against the Obama style plan originally (in 03) but now she wants to go even further. \n\nThat\'s not actually accurate.  Her position has always been roughly what Obama\'s position is; basically, give legal status and a path to citizenship to people who are already here, while also enforcing the border to stop more illegal immigrants from coming in.  That\'s the "grand bargin" Obama\'s been trying to get his entire administration, and that\'s the same thing she supported.\n\nSo, no, her position really hasn\'t changed.  Yes, she was in favor of a "border wall", and she was also in favor of a path to citizenship.  That\'s not a contradiction, it\'s basically the same compromise that Democrats in general have been pushing for for the last decade now.\n\nNow, personally, I think the whole "border wall" idea is stupid and pointless, a total waste of money and effort.   But that\'s really a different issue; the positions she\'s taken here are consistent and pretty common among progressives in politics.\n\n&gt;So yeah she is just pandering to votes. \n\nExcept, again, she\'s been totally consistent on pushing on this issue since the 1990\'s.   \n\n&gt; If they don\'t believe in what they say before the election how can you expect them to follow through when they are elected?\n\nI totally believe that she will try to push the country in a progressive direction if elected; she was a very liberal first lady, and a liberal senator with a liberal voting record, why wouldn\'t you think that?\n\nShe\'s not as far left as Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but I think she\'s totally serious on these issues.   Not only that, I think she won\'t make the mistake Obama did in his first term where he wasted too much time trying to make bipartisan compromises with a Republican party that had absolutely no interest in compromise; I think she\'ll hit the ground fighting hard for these issues from day 1.

aS'&gt; It typically would happen, but the fact that people expect a quick fix is unrealistic. There is a LOT screwed up about the American tax system and things can\'t be just easily repaired. \n\nFirst of all, my examples of failed "supposed to\'s" were just that. There\'s no assumed timeline or expectation of beyond explicit promises of X causing/leading to Y. Second, not all of those are caused by taxation or the government, when corporate &amp; top tier income taxes are at all time lows. Third, for some of those things, no amount of time is acceptable for them to persist or exist...if I want to avoid a ticket, excessive fuel cost or a larger carbon footprint on my conscience, I stop speeding now, not in 5, 10, 20 years later.  \n\n\n&gt;Part of the problem for states is that the Federal government sucks so many tax dollars out of the states, they tax policies of the states may not have an enormous impact.\n\nThis, I agree with, but likely for different reasons. The preeminent reason why federal spending overwrites/offsets more conservative state spending policies is because of red states and "red state interests". Period. Stop the wars and all corporate subsidies, and that issue fixes itself. (I\'d even suggest stopping welfare for the states who have a majority of voters with an ideological opposition to it, but then there\'d be homeless Republicans everywhere.)\n\n\n&gt;You message seems to imply that lower taxes have never worked. That\'s just not the case though. \n\nThen you would be putting words in my mouth. Lower taxes can work, depending on things like the pre-existing state of the economy, relative success of our education system (although, that\'s more sociological than political) and measurable level of benevolence/ethics exhibited by the private sector. Exactly none of those things are where they should be in order for lower taxes to work *right now*. \n\n\n&gt;American GDP growth has typically outpaced other countries growth, in part, because America has had lower taxes.\n\nDid you forget about everything from the New Deal, up to Nixon &amp; Ford? For that stretch of time, the exact opposite of what you\'re claiming was true.\n\n\n&gt;I never understand why so many people advocate FOR higher taxes so much. It boggles my mind.\n\nAnd I never understand why so many people think the customer\'s is the only or last word on the actual cost of goods and services...even more so when the customer supposedly wants something of better quality and higher durability. I\'m not denying the presence of wasteful government spending but you can\'t walk into a McDonald\'s and expect Filet Mignon on your $1.99 burger, anymore than you can expect a country to proverbially live on "McDonald\'s-quality" stuff in perpetuity. That, and the last person you or I should expect to even kinda know how much it really costs to run a country, is the "average taxpayer".'

I don\'t even think the Republicans are saying that. What they\'re saying is that she was incompetent and out-of-touch with what was going on on the ground. \n\nThe Benghazi thing to me isn\'t about Benghazi. It\'s about the email.

You said whether it\'s illegal or not, "It\'s a question of character."\n\nExactly.\n\nYou keep making my points for me.\n\nWhenever Hillary gets busted, there\'s always a ready excuse. If she does unethical things, but they\'re not illegal, the pre-packaged meme is, "Hey, it wasn\'t technically illegal!" And then when she *does* do things that were technically illegal [like bypassing the State Department servers, and then erasing the emails--both technically illegal], the excuse is, "Okay, okay, she broke the law. But hey! That\'s not such a big deal, right?"\n\nThere\'s always an excuse for the Clintons.\n\nAren\'t you tired of making excuses for this corrupt dynasty?\n\nIt\'s the reason why I, as a Republican, want Jeb Bush gone. My principles won\'t allow me to keep making excuses for these mob families who think it\'s their right to keep running the government.\n\nPlease, please, please--if you have a shred of character or principle left--throw your support behind someone who isn\'t a compromised, corporatist, NAFTA-peddling con artist. There are so many people on the Left with character [like Bernie Sanders]. But you\'ll ignore someone who actually represents your interests, because the media wants you to support one of the two Goldman Sachs candidates: a Clinton or a Bush.\n\nThis nonsense has to change. We have to stop being so easily played. "Er . . . uh . . . all those ethical violations and illegal acts are . . . er . . . conspiracy theories purely cooked up by the other side." No! No, they\'re not. Really, they\'re not!

aS'How is this really capitalism though? Yes, the businesses are "private", but their only client is the government. That sounds more like the technical definition of facism to me, not capitalism. The reason all of these businesses buy out government is because the government essentially has the power to decide which businesses survive and which die. They buy government and then use government to make their businesses thrive. That isn\'t capitalism. Capitalism is when businesses have to compete in the market in order to thrive, it isn\'t a system in which the government makes that decision. When government is making the decision of who succeeds it then becomes vital to businesses that want to succeed to buy government. It is the excessive power of the state that gives incentives to the corruption of the state.\n\nDemocrats like Elizabeth Warren who think giving more power to government in order to regulate the growing corruption of the private sector is a good idea don\'t consider that it is precisely this kind of increase in government power that is ultimately corrupting government. You give government the power to decide markets, who is going to want that power, and what will they be willing to do to get it?\n\nRepublicans focus on the corrupting effect government has on the private sector, democrats focus on the corrupting effect the private sector has on government.\n They act as if they are mortal enemies, but they are actually two sides of the same coin.

aS'&gt;Conservative Republicans most powerful weapon is cynicism about government -- which theyve been able to enlarge and spread simply by being incompetent, corrupt, bigoted, and dumb. The worse they get, the more I hear from people nothing can get done, its useless to try, government is dysfunctional, and why should I get involved? In other words, the lower they sink, the closer they come to their ultimate goal  making Americans so distrustful of government that we give up on it, and cede it to the moneyed interests (big corporations, Wall Street, Koch brothers and their billionaire friends) that would like nothing better than to have it all to themselves.\n\n    Robert Reich, Labor Secretary under Bill Clinton'

We have elections to elect candidates who will shape policy according to the will of the people (theoretically, though not so much in practice).\n\nFor everyone like you who is against taxation and claiming that it is tantamount to theft, I would remind you that there was once an era in American politics known as the progressive era. Both Democrats and Republicans had progressive wings and taxation was markedly higher starting around WWII. The American people believed that society needed each other to succeed in the war effort and in pulling the country out of the Great Depression.  The era proceeding the progressive era was known as the gilded age...and income inequality paralleled the inequality of today.  Don't be fooled though: not everyone shares your convictions or ideals.

aS'The GOP is simply a far better political party than the Democrats.  To be clear on what I mean, here\'s a definition:\n\n&gt;A political party is an organization of people which seeks to achieve goals common to its members through the acquisition and exercise of political power.\n\nThe GOP is among the best in the world at the game of politics, the Democrats average at best.  They use every tactic available, gain every little advantage.  They are better at fundraising, better at focusing their base, better at pushing as a unified front.  \n\nBut what they are really good, better perhaps than any political movement in modern history, is pushing fear.  They\'ve learned that fear is the secret to a unified political base, a way of forcing social conservatives to hold hands with financial conservatives that come from entirely different backgrounds.\n\nExamples?  /r/conservative.  Breaking down their top posts (note, this is general.  I\'m mainly noting the fact that they AREN\'T talking policy issues, but rather pushing tension):\n\n* Fear of blacks\n* Fear of blacks\n* Fear of Mexicans\n* Fear of blacks and Mexicans\n* Fear of big government\n* Fear of Mexicans\n* Nothing\n* Fear of Mexicans\n* Fear of liberal media\n* &amp;c., with some fear of Muslims thrown in\n\nAlmost every post is designed to create tension towards an out-group.  You\'ll see very similar things at /r/republican, or even non-US conservative subreddits like /r/tory, albeit with different out-groups.  \n\nThe constant usage of fear acts as a massive directing force for the Republican party, and the same tactics have been used for massive conservative shifts in almost all the English speaking countries (Canada, the UK, and Australia have all shifted heavily towards the right).  \n\nFear is so useful to a political party because it lowers critical thinking and dissension. Republicans aren\'t less intelligent than Democrats, but they have to deal with far more fear-pushing bullshit.  How can a person vote in their own best interest if they have fear clouding their judgement?  \n\nLiberal groups try to use fear in similar ways, but they fail because their out-groups are more abstract.  Because their base is more varied, they don\'t have convenient scapegoats like conservative groups have.  Compare "the rich" versus "Muslims."  Which is easier to picture?  Which is easier to to use as a boogeyman?  \n\nThe great thing about the Republican tactics is that they feed into themselves.  They push conspiracies to create fear, and that fear lowers critical thinking and makes it easier to push other conspiracies.  This is why they make everything into a conspiracy.  Climate change isn\'t just wrong, it is a global liberal conspiracy.  Hillary and Obama aren\'t just bad politicians, they are involved with scores of conspiracies.  \n\nTL;DR:  Most of your rant comes down to the fact that a political party\'s goal is not to improve the country, but to win elections.  The Republicans are far better at winning elections, motivating their base with fear while the Democrats struggle with voter apathy because they can\'t use the same tactic nearly as well.  '

aS"&gt;when republican policies pushed us to the brink of another depression?\n\nThey were Democratic policies too. I know that's easy to forget.\n\n&gt;How are we so mad at Obama\n\nNow I need to vent. Obama had a super majority in Congress when he first came into office, and rather than using his majority to pass a higher minimum wage, reform banking in a meaningful way, raise taxes on the 1% or pursue green energy policy he decided to pass his legacy and force the ACA through a Democratic Congress. A law that gives huge handouts to the country's wealthiest corporations. He also raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than any other president and has deported more immigrants.\n\nThat's not all. Obama expanded America's foreign policy, drone use and military spending, while doubling down on the domestic spying he promised to eliminate. He also pushes secret trade deals that will continue to benefit the top 1% at the expense of everyone else.\n\nDespite all of this, people continue to support him because he talks a big game. He says the things we all want to hear knowing he can't follow through on it, or purposefully does the opposite. But the Republicans are worse right? They're the ones responsible for running once prosperous cities into the ground from decades worth of poor policies. No, wait, that was what the Democrats did to Detroit. Democrats, despite their policies of good intentions, slowly killed one of America's greatest cities. \n\nAre Republicans constructive to America? No, I don't believe so, but pretending Democrats are the change America needs is laughably naive."

While Bush lost 6 million in just 8 years all by himself.\n\nI want a successful country.  Not a failure.  And that takes creating jobs - not destroying them. And whether spending is 30% or 33% or 38% just doesn\'t make up for losing jobs.  Aside from that, spending went up during Bush so its hard to see Republicans having some upper hand on spending, and the debt tripled from Bush and unbudgeted Iraq spending that we, the middle class have to pay off.

It wasn't until the purpose of subsidizing these industries became vital to the continued existence of the governments that it began to see government intervention. My point is that decreasing the money spent on NASA is one thing, but one should focus on where the money is spent alternatively. Republicans want to stop funding NASA so it can be spent on defense, Sanders wants to decrease funding NASA and do what? It appears he is all for scientific research, which is a plus. Personally, I think we need to advance more in science before we can honestly tackle the space problem, and with a limited government budget, right now funding science in other areas might be reasonable.

aS'Democratic republic is a thing, indeed that\'s what it is.  That\'s why one of the two original parties was named the "Democratic Republicans"  I\'m amused that "I am a child in your view".  Please explain your justification.\n\nOh, wait, you didn\'t.  After my initial comment was that enforcement mechanisms in a complex society are too messy to be distilled down to the minarchist libertarian idea of "one right: property", you then say socioeconomic systems are "ridiculously complex", so how do you think that your "liberty" concept would spread?  I have given you examples of why it would never be implemented because it is SO FAR from what any nation in the world has actually gravitated towards, and you haven\'t given a single example of WHY people would gravitate toward your system.\n\nAgain, why would people embrace a concept of "individual liberty" that results in the complete destruction of ACTUAL (i.e. experiential or phenomenological) liberty for the majority of the world population?  When push comes to shove, I and nearly every other person will trade abstract liberty for free time to pursue our interests (i.e. actual liberty), health care and freedom from disease (i.e. actual liberty), autonomy in the workplace and some degree of control over our wages and working conditions (i.e. actual liberty), control over the political system (i.e. actual liberty).  See, your idea of liberty is meaningless to those who have no capital assets and have no power or leverage in society.  Not to mention the incompatibility between liberty and the exclusive ownership of land property (you didn\'t build property and even Nozick (!) made fun of the absurdity of the "mixing labor with land" argument, not to mention Proudhon\'s takedown long before).\n\nNo offense (wait, no, offense intended), but if promoting individual liberty does not lead to the greater good, then it means more individuals are losing liberty in order for a smaller number to gain liberty. \n\nGiven your choice, I go with Socialism 101 times out of 100, because the only thing that matters is the greatest good for the greatest number.  To say otherwise is to say that increasing some nebuolous conception of freedom is BETTER than people actually being healthier and happier and more secure in their lives. The idea that your life is more important than all other lives is the only way one can justify libertarianism.'

But it doesn\'t really matter what the public wants, when Congressman are accountable to a tiny subset of the people who voted for president and thus feel free to ignore any "mandate" that the presidential election supposedly shows.\n\nAnd the more liberal the Democratic president, the more Republicans feel they can ignore him.

Given how close elections are in the US in the last few cycles, that little uptick in their base getting out could easily swing a few key states back red.

Pretty incredulous. \n\nShe either trusts Obama or she doesn't but there really is no middle ground here.

They think the free market and/or local charities and the like are the appropriate tool to solve these problems. They also think people need to "take responsibility" to solve their own problems. \n\nThis makes some sense in theory, but in reality some of the issues we face are so large and complex that the best solutions are actually top down government programs. But many Conservatives are so locked into the "big government always bad, small government always good" rhetoric that they are unable or unwilling to admit there are cases where it is good and even necessary. And even when they do agree government has a role in solving some problem, their "no new taxes" pledges prevent them from being able to fund it without cuts to other programs or going in to debt. \n\nSo while I don\'t agree with the "Republicans don\'t care" message, I do think that many don\'t care enough to overcome their existing ideological positions to actually do something productive to fix issues like health care.

But, to be fair, this is also exactly what Obama did to Hillary Clinton during the 2008 primaries regarding the individual mandate for health care.\n\nClinton supported it because it was obviously the best policy and was recommended by every liberal think tank that had ever studied health care reform.  Obama opposed it because it was politically unpopular, and it was easy for Obama to use it against Clinton by scaring people about "being forced to buy healthcare you don\'t need"--[the exact same attack line Republicans used successfully against the Clinton health care plan in 1993](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/obama-does-harry-and-louise-again/).  \n\nOf course, once Obama took office, he [quickly reversed his position](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/20/barack-obama/obama-flip-flops-requiring-people-buy-health-care/) on mandates because he had to actually govern, and everyone agreed that mandates would have to be part of any functioning health care reform.  \n\nSo while Obama is on the receiving end of the ignorant populism being whipped up by Warren, he\'s no stranger to the game.'

Of those who view gun rights as an essential issue, and in particular those singe-issue voters, the vast majority will vote conservative because that's the side that supports the issue.  Republicans made huge gains in the last mid-term elections, and the issue of gun rights was a major part of that.  \n\nYes, Vermont is a liberal state that doesn't have a big gun control push.  They are the exception to the rule in that regard, particularly in that part of the nation.  And yes, Sanders doesn't push gun control largely because of that constituency.  I'm hoping he carries that through the election, because there's a huge block of voters all across the country with the same views.  However, based upon his voting record while in Congress, you really can't call him anti-gun control."

aS"&gt; and unlike Hillary who has clearly shifted left in social issues as it has become acceptable, he has the record to prove it.\n\nHillary has a long record of left-leaning political issues.  She's been successful in large part because she knows how to reach out to historically right-leaning institutions and get them on board.  That's one reason the GOP hates the Clintons with a burning passion.  Business leaders and special interests that historically aligned with the GOP broke to support the Clintons in the 80s when Bill ran for governor and again in the 90s when he ran for President.\n\nIt should say something that Republicans don't really give a shit about Bernie Sanders.  He's not a threat to them, because he's not winning their base of voters to a more liberal political agenda.  Sanders is a great guy and a great Senator, but he's not a great coalition builder.

It's pretty safe to say that that's at least a little beyond any margin of error created by the natural messiness of everything.\n\nSecond, what separates these seven states from others is the fact that Republicans redrew the districts. If you compare these numbers to numbers in states where Republicans did not redraw the districts, you do not see such an obvious bias toward Republicans (go figure). You really do not see these results at the same scale with the DNC. /u/mrojek is, essentially, correct.

Women have no rights.  They don't believe in science. They want to keep de-funding the educational system. They want to increase the defense budget. They want to kill social security, NASA, EPA, Medicare, Medicaid, ACA, VA, federal minimum wage, unions, etc. and leave that up to private companies.  They want to extend the retirement age, have fun working until you are 70.  They want your social security to be gambled on wall street; your retirement is no longer guaranteed. They want to deregulate wall street and corporations (see previous sentence).  They want to continue to ship jobs to other countries. They want to keep open loopholes and laws that allows billionaires and corporations to stash money offshore to avoid paying US taxes, which is welfare for corporations.  Then they will convince you sheep that the real problem and drain on our economy is poor people on welfare, which, the Republicans are trying very hard to increase in numbers.\n\nDemocrats are no angels but they are nowhere near as terrible for the country as the Republicans of the last 30 years, especially the current crop of paid off puppets."

Not as safe as free seats, but if you think you can win them, you have a better chance than areas you can't. Republicans drew those lines because they had zero chance in the 8 spots they drew."
p943
aS"And per that article, 8 of those 10 districts were drawn by Republicans.\n\nThat's one of the basic ideas behind gerrymandering- if you can stick all of the likely voters for the opposing party in a small number of districts, sure they'll be guaranteed to win those.  But they'll be at a serious disadvantage in the others.\n\nSay you have 100 voters for 10 districts, and they're evenly spit between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMake 2 districts of entirely Democrats.  Okay, they have 2 completely safe seats- heavily gerrymandered districts.

If you can find a reputable source which claims the Democrats benefit more from gerrymandering I will concede.\n\n&gt;If the Democrats are in power, it helps the Democrats.\n\nYou don't seem to understand how gerrymandering works. Only the party in power when the districts are redrawn benefits from gerrymandering. For the next decade or so that power balance remains even if the party who was previously in power is replaced. For example: Lets say the Democrats are in power during a redistricting year. They gerrymander our districts in their favor and the following year, they get completely voted out of office and the Republicans have a majority. The gerrymandered districts will still benefit the Democrats until the next redrawing of the districts. In our current situation, the Republicans benefit more than the Democrats. The Democrats benefit in certain situations, but the Republicans simply have more districts gerrymandered in their favor and they will continue to have this advantage until the 2020 elections when the districts will be redrawn.\n\n&gt;I feel like I'm explaining this to a 7-year old for fucks sake.\n\nA 7 year old who is a Political Science graduate student and likely knows significantly more than you do on this subject.

aS'&gt; This is one where both parties should be killing it.\n\nThere\'s a slight problem.  Republican voters will reward Republicans that jam their collective dicks in the gears of Congress.  Republicans are rewarded when nothing gets done.  Republican voters *like* political dysfunction, because it feeds the "Government Bad!" narrative.  Democrats aren\'t going to line up and support a Congressman that walks onto the floor of the House spewing lies and deliberately trying to kill anything resembling a debate by acting like an asshat.  You can\'t beat the GOP in a dick swinging contest, because the GOP likes dick way more than the Dems do.'

I just wish libertarians didn\'t owe anything to the GOP, the GOP platform is the very antithesis of libertarianism. \n\nBut who cares, wouldn\'t hurt to at least see Paul win the primary.

aS"Anyone paying attention knows the primary reason Republicans have stayed relevant in politics (or, the reason they haven't had to adopt more moderate policies to stay relevant) is because they have been able to stack the deck in elections, through gerrymandering, EC, and voter de-reg.  Polictics has become less and less about gaining broad support, and more and more about gaining strong support of the influential few.\n\nDemocrats do it too - making sure anchor-babies grow up to get the right to vote, for example. But citizens should take a long-term view: support closing as many loopholes as possible to make for as fair elections as possible. "

Gerrymanders allow you to win more seats than you otherwise would. What gerrymanders have no impact on are statewide races. Your statement makes absolutely no sense in the context of gerrymanders.\n\nCA currently sends 38 democrats to the house. Estimates I saw had them gaining ~4 seats in CA if they gerrymandered it.

I'm not saying Democrats are smart and Republicans are dumb, for the record. Republicans also have a stronger tendency to be religious, while scientists are less often religious than the average population.\n\nEach party has to cater to their base. Perhaps most scientists aren't on board some of the Republican policies that cater towards those who are largely religious and the less-educated (this sounds like an insult to Republicans, but for the record I used to be Republican and I am still very religious)? Republicans haven't had a great track record with science PR. Maybe these are why scientists are more to the left, and not because they want the government controlling our lives.\n\nAgain, I don't understand why scientists would want the government controlling our lives."

aS'&gt; I do know what a gerrymander is, and I was specifically talking about local elections (Most notably House &amp; State Legislature).\n\nBut those are specifically impacted by gerrymandering. Democrats lost their super majority in the state legislature -- a major component of a lot of laws for California. They absolutely would have benefited quite a bit from gerrymandering on a purely political perspective. Trying to write it off as a no-fear for them because they will still hold standard majorities doesn\'t really make sense to me.\n\n&gt;  There are maybe 2 other states with massive one-party dominance and every other Democratic state would fight tooth &amp; nail against this to preserve their control.\n\nDemocrats also gave up the possibility to gerrymander in states like New Jersey, Washington, and Hawaii. Republicans gave it up in states like Idaho and Arizona. Montana was also given up, technically by democrats but that might be the only one that can really be evaluate as being a true "give" by both parties. Overall, the political "give" from democrats across such bodies is a lot larger than that from republicans.'

Who would want to believe something so dire? It\'s much easier to think "maybe there\'s something to it, but it will only affect my grandkids."

He can\'t just sign anything he likes into law, or have people locked up for cases we couldn\'t win. Anybody that thought he was going to stop all military action doesn\'t appreciate how much more knowledge and external counsel a president has concerning military strategy and deployment. \n\nThere are definitely things to be critical of, but when he says something like "tax the rich" the response has become "OH YEA, WE\'RE GOING TO TRUST THE GUY WHOS FUCKING US WITH A TRADE DEAL WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AND HASNT BEEN FINALIZED AND STILL HAS TO COME TO A VOTE". \n\nWhat sucks is that the whole push and pull between the two parties is largely a cultural thing, so even the people who consider themselves liberal (which is the smarter and more rational party) aren\'t reaching that decision through informed thoughtfulness, but rather because it\'s popular right now. I\'d rather people be on the right side for the wrong reasons than on the wrong side for the wrong reasons, but what would really be ideal is if a huge portion of the Democratic Party wasn\'t just as ignorant as the Republican Party, and happen to have backed the better bandwagon.

aS"They're framing it as a matter of mission creep. NASA is the *National Aeronautics and Space Administration.* Note: nowhere in that title does it mention terrestrial earth science. \n\nTruthfully, NASA has had quite a large amount of mission creep. AFAIK, it wasn't created to be a gigantic earth science research department. Republicans aren't happy about NASA's conclusions that are inconvenient to the Republican narrative, so they want to take NASA back to its roots: aeronautics and space. \n\nBut the thing is, that mission creep came quite naturally, and it's actually a very good thing. NASA are experts at building and launching satellites. It so happens that their expertise in the space realm has translated directly into revolutionary earth science. The agency that should be studying earth science most, NOAA, is not a space administration, and it does not have space and satellite expertise. Thus, while NOAA does excellent work, our understanding of the planet would be substantially less without NASA's space-based instruments. \n\nOn top of that, NASA does planetary science. We don't understand other planets, so we have to use Earthly analogs to understand extraterrestrial planetary bodies. This gives NASA a direct reason to study the earth--specifically, study the earth *from space-based observations.* Why? Because the more we can understand our planet from afar, the more we can understand other planets from afar. \n\n**tl;dr** NASA is the National *Aeronautics and Space* Administration, and part of its mission is to study extraterrestrial planetary bodies. The best way to understand objects outside Earth from space-based observations is to understand our own planet from space-based observations, so its mission has evolved to study the Earth-space environment. **If you remove NASA's ability to study our own planet, you remove its ability to learn about other planets.** Further, NOAA is not capable of taking over NASA's terrestrial role because it does not have a history of working in space.

aS"&gt; You missed my point, why does it matter which Democrat gets elected? Bernie can do the same game that you described for Hillary. Does it matter who gets elected? Regardless nothing gets passed for another 8 years either way.\n\nIt matters they get elected in the first place. Hillary is way better positioned than Sanders to keep the GOP out of the White House. That'll have a huge effect on the next 4-8 years. \n\n&gt;Americans don't want anything to pass until at least 2024. The main reason to vote for any Democrat is to ensure this. I'm fine with their strategy, we have plenty of laws already, why do we need any more?\n\nSorry to be blunt but that's all super zany. If you're making a joke I didn't understand it. You may like gridlock but [Americans don't.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163031/gridlock-top-reason-americans-critical-congress.aspx)  And [Republicans get the blame](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=who%27s+to+blame+for+gridlock+poll).\n\n&gt;No president will have any leverage at all over Congress because they only run in their own districts where it ensures their reelection. Everyone wins this way. The Democrats get to keep Congress from doing anything and the Republicans do the same to the president... everyone wins.\n\nThe house is insulated by districting, but the senate isn't. Since they pay the price when the house shits the bed, the president has leverage over the house via the senate. Look at the well-documented conflict between the house and senate the during the shutdown; the Republicans in the senate were desperate to make a deal with Obama once the GOP starting getting the blame. If the Republicans in the house want to dig their heels in against a popular presidential agenda, it'll be at the expense of their own party's future. In the meanwhile, Democrats can still do a lot with control with 2 &amp; 1/2 branches of the federal government. \n\nIn the long run, a liberal supreme court will start chipping away at bad districting sooner or later, eroding the GOP's advantage in the house. There's a strong chance that begins in Hillary's first term.\n\n&gt;Hillary however has a problem, no one really likes or trusts her, she is our modern Richard Nixon. (They even look a bit alike.) She wins a national election IF the Democrats show up. Nixon got elected and she may as well. She just needs a good turn out.\n\nDemocratic chances always hinge on turnout but that won't be a problem with the first female candidate headlining a major ticket.

aS"\n&gt;Yeah, the division here is an interesting one, and it may be that this move is simply an administrative shuffling of budgets. If NOAA's budget gets raised a corresponding amount, then this whole thing is a non-issue.\n\nYou're just falling for the Republicans' trap.\n\n[*Last year, the Republican-controlled House passed a bill that would have required NOAA to dedicate more money on weather-forecasting than climate-change studies.*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2015/01/21/climate-change-skeptics-cruz-and-rubio-now-help-oversee-nations-climate-science/)   \n\nWeather Climate, and Republicans are at it again, weakening NOAA's ability to study Climate.  They want to transfer climate-study authority to NOAA instead of NASA, while simultaneously shifting NOAA's research from climate and weather to just weather.\n\n&gt; In the end I think it would make more sense to reallocate NASA's climate science budget to NOAA, and then have NASA bid on space-based NOAA missions.\n\nNASA is the single greatest organization on Earth when it comes to remote sensing research, and monitoring climate change relies heavily on remote sensing.  The stakes are too high to not send in our best player."

It is actually amazing to me that this election seems to be peeling back that stigma.  Young people will stand up, and do so with an unstoppable agenda when you give them something worth fighting for.  Sanders seems to be rallying this group more than I have ever seen any political candidate do in his/her career.  Sure, Obama was a master of tapping into the non-voters.  He played the race card and got support from a massive amount of minorities.  Clinton reaches out to women.  Sanders though, is the first candidate I have ever seen that has people, especially young voters who suddenly are interested. High schoolers starting campaign programs to raise awareness for him from teachers and other parents.  College kids who are making sure their ducks are in a row so they can choose which state their vote will be more beneficial in.\n\nFirst candidate you will see who unites young (and old) people around a cause and a person they truly believe in.

Now I'm in that group for the first time in my life. (Applause.) And you might remember that when I was in office, on occasion, the Republicans were kind of mean to me. (Laughter.) But soon as I got out and made money, I began part of the most important group in the world to them. It was amazing. I never thought I'd be so well cared for by the president and the Republicans in Congress. (Cheers, applause.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I almost sent them a thank-you note for my tax cuts -- (laughter) -- until I realized that the rest of you were paying for the bill for it, and then I thought better of it. (Cheers, applause.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, look at the choices they made, choices they believed in. They chose to protect my tax cut at all costs, while withholding promised funding for the Leave No Child Behind Act, leaving 2.1 million children behind. (Cheers, applause.) They chose to protect my tax cut while cutting 140,000 unemployed workers out of their job- training programs, 100,000 working families out of their child-care assistance, and worst of all, while cutting 300,000 poor children out of their after-school programs when we know it keeps them off the streets, out of trouble, in school learning, going to college and having a good life! (Cheers, applause.)\n&gt; \n&gt; They chose, they chose to protect my tax cut while dramatically raising the out-of-pocket costs of health care to our veterans, and while weakening or reversing very important environmental measures that Al Gore and I put into place, everything from clean air to the protection of our forests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, in this time, everyone in America had to sacrifice except the wealthiest Americans. And most of us, all most all of us, from Republicans to Independents and Democrats, we wanted to be asked to do our part too, but all they asked us to do was to expend the energy necessary to open the envelopes containing our tax cuts. (Applause.)\n\nHere's [Hillary Clinton in 2008](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/us/politics/21clinton.html?sq=&amp;pagewanted=all):\n\n&gt; She said that economic excesses  including executive-pay packages she characterized as often offensive and wrong and a tax code that had become so far out of whack in favoring the wealthy  were holding down middle-class living standards.\n&gt; \n&gt; But when discussing the causes of the middle-class wage slowdown, she tends to focus not on market-based changes, like technology and trade, but on institutions, like unions and the government.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her first priority, she said, would be changing the tax code. She has proposed tax credits for college tuition, retirement savings, health care and alternative energy use, most of which would go to lower- and middle-income families. She would also raise the top marginal rate to 39.6 percent, its level for much of her husbands administration. Increasing high-end tax rates would bring in $52 billion a year, her campaign says, and help pay for some of her other proposals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its shocking that there is such a continuing political pressure to lower tax rates on the wealthy, when so much of what we look back on now with nostalgia and pride, she said, referring to the decades immediately after World War II, was at a time when those who were well off were paying a significantly higher percentage of their income.\n&gt; \n&gt; She said she would also use the White House bully pulpit to inveigh against the current level of executive pay. Though it is difficult to reduce such pay with new laws, she said, she wants to consider proposals that law school and business school professors have made along these lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have this class now of professional corporate managers who are not the creators of the corporation  they very rarely had anything to do with starting the business or building it up, she said. And then they come in and they believe their No. 1 obligation is to secure the biggest possible pay package at the expense at everybody else."

No one would defend me if I shot a toddler in the face, and that is how many Republicans view abortion.  (personally I would prefer removing all abortion restrictions, if you want a 27 week abortion, whatever be my guest).\n\nAll of this is combined with a general idea that all the federal government is capable of is fucking up things.

While the U.S. tends to run a surplus in April due to tax filing season, the surplus was $50 billion more than last year and the fifth largest monthly surplus on record.\n\nThe figures are the latest indication that rising stock values, corporate profits, and incomes for the wealthiest Americans are curbing the growth of U.S. budget deficits that soared in the years following the financial crisis.\n\nRevenues for the fiscal year through April are running 9% ahead of the year earlier, while government spending is running 6% ahead of last year. The fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2014.\n\nFor the 12-month period ended in April, the U.S. ran a deficit of $460 billion, the second-lowest annual figure since September 2008. The deficit over the last 12 months is down from the year-earlier figure of $499 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated just two months ago that the deficit would stand at $486 billion in the current fiscal year.\n\nCongress and the White House agreed to a series of spending curbs four years ago that sharply reined in government spending, known as the sequestration. While government spending has advanced over the past year, April showed that revenues are now running ahead of spending, holding down deficits.\n\nRepublican control of Congress means that big battles still loom over how much money the government should collect and how it should be spent. President Barack Obama has called for an increase in spending above levels set out by the sequester.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans passed a joint budget resolution earlier this month that would boost military spending while holding domestic spending essentially flat. That measure doesn't go to the White House and instead will be used to set overall spending levels for appropriations bills that will go to the president later this year.\n\nMr. Obama has said he won't accept bills that keep spending at the levels mandated by the sequester nor those that boost military spending without parallel increases in nondefense spending.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has yet to raise the federal debt limit. The Treasury has been using emergency measures since mid-March to avoid breaching the ceiling. While the Treasury hasn't yet said how long it might be able to do that, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that those emergency measures should last until October or November. "

They have no real serious will to win the presidency since they have gerrymandered control of enough of the statehouses, legislatures, and Congress to get their agenda passed one way or another. Meanwhile, Wall St will pump money into the Democrats the same way they did with Obama and Clinton so that "the right person" heads the snake as it treads on the rights of the majority who can\'t afford to buy access to power in order for their voices to be heard, nevermind taken seriously.

aS"&gt;We have a majority of registered democrats in this state and yet the Republican Party holds every single state elected office as well as majorities in both state houses. If gerrymandering benefited both parties, one would expect to see a distribution of elected officials form both.\n\nWhile the state house outcomes may reflect partisan gerrymandering in favor of Republicans, the fact that they hold all statewide elected offices suggests that there is something else at play here: statewide office elections are not affected by the sort of redistricting that gerrymandering implies.\n\nThe data you've given implies other causation for the differing voter registration vs. election outcomes. Perhaps Republicans are better at turning registered Democratic voters. Perhaps independents in the state lean Republican. Or perhaps neither of those things is true in the long term, and the current distribution is due to more specific issues in the last election (I'm not Floridian; I don't know). A handful of weak candidates from the Democratic side in races could hugely affect the outcomes.\n\nHaving said that, the statehouse representation does potentially suggest some redistricting favoring Republicans in the state.\n\n&gt;Can you explain why this is? In fact, can you provide an example of a single state where gerrymandering is an acknowledged issue that doesn't have a majority of Republicans in charge??\n\nThe explanation is that while gerrymandering itself is politically neutral, it may have been practiced more - or more severely - by one party than the other in a particular state.\n\nAs for examples of Democratic gerrymandering, Maryland is the most gerrymandered state in the nation - along with North Carolina - and its districts were redrawn by Democrats in 2012.

It's amazing how lowering the tax rates on the wealthiest citizens often correllates to some sort of economic decline, overall. During Eisenhower America, that time the Republicans seem obsessed with bringing us back to, the wealthiest citizens paid around 90% in taxes. Nixon dropped this to 70% before Regan lowered it even further (to roughly 30%). Clinton came in and raised it up to approximately 36% and our economy rebounded. Then Bush came in and gave his famous Bush-era tax breaks and I don't have to tell you how the economy looked when he left office.\n\nObama came along and brought taxes back up to where they were during the Clinton administration and we've seen steady job growth over the last year (at least).\n\nIt's important to remember the correllation does not mean causation, exactly, but it's interesting to look at almost 100 years of tax codes and compare them to the economies of their time.\n\n"

aS'Can we clarify what you mean by "gridding"? Because what I envision when you say that is a grid where every congressional district in the US is a square of the same size, regardless of population density and, to me, the strongest argument against that is that it would give *massively* disproportionate representation - for instance, Alaska would have one vote in the House for approximately every 10k residents, while California would have one vote for every 2 *million* residents - Alaskan US citizens would have, on average, ~200x the legislative representation in their federal government that Californian US citizens had, and that\'s not even accounting for bits of the grid in sparsely populated parts of the state where you\'d potentially have a House rep representing the interests of less than 1000 people.\n\n*If*, on the other hand, what you mean by "gridding" is the shortest-splitline algorithm, then we should be having an entirely different conversation.\n\n&gt;gerrymandering is very useful to solidify a base especially if the base is ensconced in a bastion of opposition.\n\nThe problem is that, by and large, this is *not* how it\'s being used - instead, it\'s being used to take, for example, 5 districts that are all relatively competitive, say 50/50 for ease of example usage, and redividing them such that you have *one* district which is 90/10 in favor of Democrats, and *four* districts which are 60/40 in favor of Republicans. This is being done with *zero* regard for giving minority groups/opinions a voice.\n\n&gt; from my perspective they want to end it before it can get gerrymandered back on what I\'m assuming they fear to be a 2016 fully republican congress.\n\nI\'m not sure what you mean by "fully Republican" but, since Democrats historically have exceptionally low turnout in off-year elections (Republicans have lower turnout in off-years as well, but the difference isn\'t as extreme), *all* House seats are up for election every 2 years, and all the districts will be the same as they were in 2014, statistically speaking, the Democrats will likely pick up seats in the House in 2016. That\'s not to say they\'ll gain a majority, just that they are very unlikely to have a net *loss* of House seats in the 2016 elections, because it\'s the same seats and districts as 2014, just with better Democratic turnout relative to Republican turnout than in 2014, if history is any guide, at least. Likewise, in the 2016 Senate race, the Republicans are likely to lose seats because, of the 17 seats considered to have competitive races, 14 are Republican, while only 3 are Democratic, so the Republicans have a lot more to lose and the Democrats have a lot more to gain - for comparison, in the 2014 election, Republicans held only 3 of the 11 seats considered to be competitive, so they had less to lose and more to gain, which is exactly what wound up happening.'

aS"Sure, but the people can push candidates further towards a favorable agenda by voting for candidates who are a little more pro-whatever-the-people-want. For instance, right now, populist ideas are making a resurgence (for good reason), and candidates, at least on the left, are listening to varying degrees. This way you gradually get candidates who are more favorable over time.\n\nBut you can't just abstain from voting and expect changes. Nothing changes then. It becomes like say, the Republican primaries, where voter participation is low and thus you get super right-wing people picking the Republican nominee.\n\nAlso consider that right now, Republicans are glad a lot of voters are apathetic, and that's good for them, because they win more often when less people vote. If people are upset with the status quo right now, the last thing they want is more Republicans. So what I'm saying is, you can't change the game if you don't participate."

And NASA\'s [Earth Observing System](http://eospso.nasa.gov/) is a jewel in the crown of humanity, studying oceans, land use, winds, radiation budget, magnetosphere, and many other aspects of the third planet from the Sun.\n\nUnless NASA is given a mission by the Congress, or given the go ahead by Congress to accomplish a mission they, NASA, have proposed, they can\'t do anything, so whatever track they\'re on now was all approved by Congress. If Congress wants NASA to do something in outer space, they need to approve funding for something and make sure they\'re not going to take it back at some later date.\n\nBut you know what? If you look at the mission justifications for _any_ NASA mission, somewhere in there you\'ll find some sentence about gaining "a better understanding of processes here on Earth". If that\'s the point of it all, then why not just study Earth? It\'s a planet! It\'s in space! It\'s the easiest planet in the Solar System to launch a probe to, and it\'s got the most complex atmosphere/hydrosphere/lithosphere interactions of any planet, plus it has a large magnetosphere.'

aS'They wouldn\'t have been seen as "socialists" in the 1970s, but middle-of-the-road moderates.  And if you go further back, the Republicans were socialists.\n\nThe meaning of the word "socialist" is still dynamic.  It is interpreted as anywhere from full-blown communist to a reluctant admission that a social program is the only thing that currently works to solve a problem, but otherwise, everything should be capitalist.\n\nLook at Eisenhower in the 1950s, for example: "Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism.[117] He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years, [which had not been completed under Truman."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower)\n\nToday we only talk about smaller government, privatizing Social Security (Even Obama pushed \'chained CPI\', which would have reduced Social Security payments over the years), and cutting benefits.\n\nA "socialist" during the Eisenhower administration would have been a communist.\n\nToday a "socialist" is someone who is a capitalist.  However, they are willing to accept that if there is a great need which cannot be met by capitalist means, then they are willing to accept a socialist solution to the problem.  Medicare and Social Security are examples.'

Is it a ridiculous comparison?

He did not create the Internet tech boom.  This was a huge factor on the economy during his tenure.  He raised taxes pretty heftily and didn\'t see a substantial increase in revenue.  The republicans took power in congress and passed a capital gains tax cut of 8% and added a child tax credit.  We don\'t see the Clinton balanced budgets until after taxes are cut.  The tech boom is in full effect, people are making money, and the government is getting higher revenues with lower taxes.  This is also with the Republicans shutting the government down twice over spending.\n\nAs someone else pointed out, the recession under Bush began with the NASDAQ crash in March of 2000 while Clinton was President.  Bush inherited a recession and then 9/11 happened.  Republicans didn\'t spend 6 years calling the economic downturn the "Clinton recession."\n\nObama is now getting credit for a recovering economy.

aS'Apologies, but I\'m hijacking the top comment to provide information. Please correct me if I\'m wrong because I really hope I am. ~~The headline appears to be incorrect, and the truth is much worse. The question of "Do you think that the Government is trying to take over Texas or not?" was not limited to Republicans [it doesn\'t have the (Republicans) tag next to it in the survey]. That means it was given to everyone. 600 Democratic primary voters and 685 Republican primary voters were polled for this.~~\n\n~~If you assume that all of the people who said yes to this question were Republicans, that means that **60%** think that the government is trying to take over Texas. Granted, that could be a very erroneous assumption, but I don\'t think I\'ve heard a single Democrat espousing this theory, in public or in private. Even if you assume 25% of those thinking the government is trying to take over Texas weren\'t Republican, that still means **45%** of Republicans think this is the case.~~\n\n~~I thought this position was fringe lunatic nonsense, but if I\'m reading this right it either is or is very close to the majority opinion of Republicans. Holy. Shit.~~\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you to /u/txgb324 for pointing out the results at the beginning were specifically for Republicans. It\'s noted in the footer, and that was not at all clear to me when reading the text. I am VERY happy to have been wrong about this.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Given the layout of the rest of this survey document, I\'m pretty certain that this question should have been tagged with the (Republican) label and that its omission is a typo.'

Most of them fail basic reasonability tests, requiring either extraordinary precognition abilities or vast conspiracies impossible to conceal.\n\nThe overall research tends to jibe with other research on the subject.  When someone assumes a belief based on no legitimate evidence, it's difficult to convince them otherwise because it's impossible to disprove the irrational evidence they imagine supports their position."

aS'Again; George Bush and his cohorts have been ignoring treaties and UN resolutions -- and you only know about what Iraq did. Fine. You also ignore that they Cheney, Rumsfeld and Bush to name a few, had numerous calls to appear in courts around the world for War Crimes, and use the considerable influence of the US to get courts to push these down. Radical countries like Spain, Candida, Germany, Ecuador -- the things that Saddam was guilty of -- they are also going to be tried for if they visit certain nations.\n\nThe UN was duped into this issue, but it was all for Oil companies and the Banks -- stop acting like you don\'t know what the Iraq invasions 1 and 2 were really about, or that the US suddenly cares about Human rights -- at least with a Bush in office.\n\nOK, but just on the face of your claim; part of that resolution that they would have to go to the UN and decide the consequences of the resolution -- so they had no support for going to war -- but the HUGE part you are missing is that it was Bush and our media who CLAIMED they violated it;\n\n&gt;&gt;"In violation of Security Council Resolution 1373, Iraq supports terrorist organizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel, and Western governments....And al-Qaida terrorists escaped from Afghanistan are known to be in Iraq."\nTurned out to be complete bullshit. The only Al Qaeda were the groups on the border and those that came in after we broke the country. Of course, if Bush brought this before the UN and not a dog and pony show with Collin Powell, his incredibly bogus sources (Curve Ball) would have been proven false.\n\n&gt;&gt; The United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 2001 found "extremely grave" human rights violations\nNope. Do you know about extraordinary rendition and enhanced interrogation techniques? George Bush\'s government promoted this policy with our own troops, contractors and CIA. Do you suddenly not care? We have proof! OK, moving on..\n\n&gt;&gt; Iraqi production and use of weapons of mass destruction (biological weapons, chemical weapons, and long-range missiles), all in violation of U.N. resolutions.\nNope. There were some weapons that were "kind of" in violation, but in almost all cases, they\'d been scuttled by UNMOVIC measures. The last of Saddam\'s weapons manufacturing seemed to have been destroyed during the Clinton era when the Republicans claimed we were destroying baby milk factories.\n\n&gt;&gt;Iraq used proceeds from the "oil for food" U.N. program to purchase weapons rather than food for its people.\nIraq flagrantly violated the terms of the weapons inspection program before discontinuing it altogether.\nNot sure about this one. Dick Cheney and other well respected Republicans made money selling him these weapons -- so maybe you can ask them.\n\n\nSo meanwhile, we spend over $4 Trillion to invade a nation. And again -- this is about Oil and Banking and the first Gulf War was as bogus as the 2nd. At no time was the concept of human life even part of the calculation other than to elicit mock outrage from people who have at other times said; "just nuke \'em." \n\nWe have a country that sells the weapons of WMD, and flouts treaties and commits war crimes and here we are putting on a kangaroo court to convict Bush\'s old tyrant buddy. The ONLY reason we invaded is because Saddam kicked out oil companies and we left when we got the production sharing agreements that put the same oil companies back in Iraq -- the same ones Dick Cheney met with well before 9/11 to decide how to carve up Iraq when they got a good enough excuse to do so in his Energy Task Force meeting.'

aS'&gt; The economy of the US sucks because of the depression, not because of a president who ended his constituency 7 years ago.\n\n\nI\'m well aware of what Bush did;\n\n* $2 Trillion in "off book" emergency expenses for war.\n\n* $750 Billion in "give away" to drug companies in the no-bid Medicare policy.\n\n* $2.4 Billion taken from SS trust fund and replaced with IOU.\n\n* Tax Breaks to wealthy that allowed for offshore exemption -- so for every dollar not taxed, we had $2 leaving the country.\n\n* His PNAC groups along with Allen Greenspan were the ones who championed the policies that allowed for the Derivatives market, the end of Glass-Stegal, and the lowering of the reserve requirement for banks (allowing them to get more and more into hock and over leverage). The estimate is $1.4 Quadrillion in Credit Default Swaps. Though I\'m sure this is not something the people on the street are aware of.\n\n* He and other Republicans partially privatized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- a point they don\'t bring up when blaming these government programs for failing.\n\n* Alienated other countries.\n\n* Prevented and defunded numerous high tech research, not only in stem cells but in Green Tech, did not support home-grown companies and the would be advantage was shipped off to China.\n\n* Promoted tax breaks (like his father) for companies offshoring or outsourcing labor.\n\n* Made oil companies immune to lawsuits based on the chemical composition of their products.\n\n* Put Blackwater and Cronies in charge of Katrina cleanup. They outsourced the labor in New Orleans to Mexicans and in many cases refused to pay them while charging the taxpayer handsomely. Massive unemployment of locals ensued.\n\n* Failed to come to the aid of Katrina victims (and I know Conservatives have their own myths surrounding what should and shouldn\'t happen, but he basically extorted the governor to hand over the national guard, and intentional stalled all efforts at help, they also wouldn\'t let Cuban doctors in, closed schools while not able to find the state with supply trucks for three months -- the list is extensive).\n\n* That\'s just a few off the top of my head. There were literally one or two major asshat or evil things I recorded BushCo doing every week of his presidency.\n\n\n\nThe Bush presidency was an artful study in; how to fuck up a country. And people like you think a government can\'t effect an economy? In what period of history does this moronic point come from other than promoting the concept that there is no such thing as "good government"? The Republican Great Depression (the original title) was started by the gilded age and Republican policies and ended by public works programs. WW II had little positive economic impact because we were blowing stuff up -- you could spend the same money on bridges, how could rebuilding Europe help our economy OTHER than as a public works project? They had no money and exports were only 5% of the US economy at that time. People repeat this crap but don\'t actually look into these factoids.\n\n\n\nGovernments DO effect the economy -- in fact, about a third of the employment and about half the expenses and MOST of the taxes. But -- taxes -- somehow they DO effect the economy? Bush employed about half a million people to sniff your socks and check your pants and blow up things -- that has no effect on employment?'

aS'I mentioned this elsewhere, but when politicians get closer to the "top" (Congress) money starts to really influence their positions. Looks closer at the state and local level and you will see this as the core discussion in most debates.\n\nFor every 1 Congressman there is about 10,000 other, smaller politicians. Politicians that never had to deal with issues such as the drug war, or defense budgets. Politicians dealing with taxes at the local level, land use rights, etc.\n\nThe 244 Congressional Republicans are vastly outnumbered by their republican elected official brethren.

aS'Honestly, I think it\'s the opposite.  Historically, at least, every times the Democrats lose, they\'ve moved a little farther to the right.   When they win (2006, 2008, 2012) they seem to get a little bit more courage, but when they\'ve lost (1994 midterm, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2010) they\'ve moved more towards the center (I guess trying to capture the elusive "moderate" voter).   It seems like every time the Democrats won, they moved a little to the left, and every time they lost, they moved to the right, while the Republicans just moved farther and farther to the right every cycle.\n\nAt least this time, in 2014, they didn\'t do that.  They lost, and if anything, that made them stand up and move farther to the left, to actually start to show some real spine.  The Republicans were clearly not expecting that, and did not know how to handle it.  As far as I can tell they still haven\'t figured that out.\n\n&gt;But for those of us outside the fold we wait for the scraps to trickle down from their past mistakes. Hunger is hunger, and a move back to the left for the sake of distancing themselves from Teapublicans is not going to feed my kid while I work more hours than any of them have in their entire career in less than a year. \n\nI know, it\'s frustrating.  It does seem like at least when they have a chance to do something without being blocked, it\'s generally positive.\n\nI\'d really love to see what a democratic president with a really progressive democratic congress might do in a couple of years if they weren\'t dealing with the biggest economic crisis of a century.  I mean, even with that, they managed to reform healthcare and banking and a half dozen other big things in two years, and that was with a bunch of middle-right blue dog democrats that are almost all out of power now (like Lieberman).    \n\nThe real key, though, is Congress.

Politicians who depend on big money contributions will govern in whatever way will ensure they keep getting that money - that's why the government is unresponsive to the will of the people and why we perceive so much corruption in our political system.  \n\nPresident Obama doesn't constantly lose on progressive issues because the Republicans are master politicians (although their intransigence is a factor, it may simply be collaborative two-party political theatre), he loses because the Democrats need to keep getting corporate campaign dollars.

Land ice and Sea ice. Land ice is ice that exists on the continent of Antarctica itself, and Sea ice is ice that exists in the sea itself. Whenever you see Republicans tripping all over themselves to "disprove" global warming by saying "SEE? THE ICE IN ANTARCTICA IS GROWING!", they have fundamentally left out something very important: They\'re only talking about Sea Ice, not Land Ice. \n\nWhy is this an important distinction? Well, because the Land Ice is far more massive than the Sea Ice, and is melting at a rate several thousand times higher than the Sea Ice is growing. \n\nAnd why, exactly, is the Sea Ice growing? Well, first there\'s the obvious reason: Gigantic chunks of land ice keep breaking off of the continent and fall into the sea.\n\nThen there\'s the not-so-obvious reasons. For one, salt water has a much lower freezing temperature than fresh water. The Antarctic sea is saltwater, but with the massive influx of freshly melted ice flowing into the sea, that lowers the salinity and greatly increases the freezing temperature of the water. Thus the melting Land Ice makes it far easier for the sea to freeze, and thus grow Sea Ice. \n\nThird; freshwater is also less dense than saltwater, and thus it tends to stay on top of the saltwater, and from point #2 we know that freshwater freezes at a much higher temperature.\n\nAll of this combines to cause more sea ice to form. Caused entirely by the land ice melting. Caused entirely by Global Warming.\n\nLook, it\'s not rocket science, but it is science nonetheless. Please keep that in mind before trying to make "points" like this in the future.'

aS'&gt; As someone with no political party affiliation, i find it funny that the liberals talk about how smart they are but act as if being able to get a picture ID is the equivalent of lifting a car off of a tiger\n\nI\'m not really going to get into how many people are affected or the issue of getting one for poor / minority people. Rather, I\'m just going to state that there is no need for the ID requirement in the first place. Republicans say it is to prevent voter fraud, but what fraud? No studies, no statistics show "rampant voter fraud" and no Republican can ever prove this allegedly "massive amount of fraud" because it doesn\'t exist.\n\nThese things have to be considered based on cost vs benefits. In this case, voter ID really only prevents a subset of people from voting, or making it difficult for them, while solving virtually no fraud. Not to mention most actual fraud is not related to in-person voting, which is what the ID requirement addresses.\n\nLastly, why should a bunch of people have to deal with more restrictions that are completely unnecessary, when the effort is blatantly partisan. It\'s not just like these Voter ID laws create ID requirements. A lot of them also cut back on early voting, election-day registration, polling locations &amp; hours, and so on. All these cut services tend to benefit Democrats at least slightly more than Republicans.\n\nTheir motive here is not genuine and the actual voter fraud statistics are so, so much lower than they would have you believe. So why should anyone have to deal with more restrictions when they are unnecessary?\n\n&gt;Less than half the people who can vote actually vote... you cant blame an ID on that\n\nSure, and these bullshit voting restriction packages being pushed the past 5 years are further chipping away at the percentage of people *who do vote*. In a time where voter participation is dropping, politicians should be making it easier to vote, not throwing up road blocks.'

aS'1. The Republicans had always been ahead of the Democrats in civil rights aspects, what happened in the incident you are referring to is Barry Goldwater decided to declare the opposite of the Republican party beliefs in a desperate attempt to gain the support  of southern racists. Obviously, this turned out to be a stupid move because not only did he still lose the election, he basically drove all black Americans from the party. Even worse, the Democrat party saw this as an excellent opportunity to use this even to gain the upper hand in succeeding elections. It\'s politics, you find out how to exploit your opponent and you do so, is it shit? Yes. Did the republican party then forever partake in Barry\'s "strategy?" No.\n\n2. The republicans and democrats didn\'t "switch sides", the Republican party did not just make its stance "okay we are racist now." No, they retracked. What happened was a hiccup, it was not a "switch sides." I mean, seriously, there was a KKK affiliated senator aligned with the Democrats who just died in 2010, while in office!\n\n3. Yes, southern racists did move to the Republican party. But how much? Well, let\'s look at some data from the general social survey. Up until 2008, the White Republicans were more okay with electing a black president than the white Democrats. [Source (a graph of the compiled data from the general social survey)](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-8.png?w=1024). White Republicans and White Democrats still hold extremely similar views on other races regarding intelligence. [Source](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-4.png?w=1024). What about the belief on black Americans and laziness? Nope, still close [Source](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-3.png?w=1024). What the actual truth here is, the amount of racists in each party are very similar. The republicans got the edge from that Goldwater stunt, but no where near a night and day difference, and nowhere near a "switched sides" worthy label. I know it may be unpopular here to believe this, but dislike of Obama does not equate to racism. Also, do note this data only counts White members of each party, as far as I know, there isn\'t much data to showcase the racial attitudes of each race in the US. \n\n5. Nowadays, what gets depicted as racism in politics, is really just the different ideas on how poverty should be handled. Republicans believe that aiding the poorer citizens is not good motivation for leaving poverty, Democrats feel differently. Here\'s another graph that depicts that similar notion! [Source](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-6.png?w=1024)\n\n5. While it may be a long time before the Republicans get black Americans with them again, it already is happening. But for the love of God, the Republican party and Democrat party did not switch, this is used as a narrative all the time in politics in an attempt to deny all the negative history the Democrat party has with civil rights and instead, shove it all off on the Republican party)\n\nDo the republicans have more racists? Yes, I literally posted statistics that show this, but it is nowhere near the level that it is made out to be, it is actually a very minor percentage, and among young republicans and young democrats, there is seemingly no difference at all. Is it bad? YES. But luckily, the aforementioned younger members of each party share far better racial feelings than the older ones.'

He has enough to handle the people that want to donate.\n\nIn fact, sometimes the opposite occurs. Consider what happens when Bernie pays his workers more: They can donate *more* to his campaign, and the money that spreads throughout the community can *also* be donated to his campaign.

I was a young libertarian transitioning to a more liberal perspective in those days, and a big part of my disenchantment with the Republican party came from Iraq. Basically, I was spending lots of time reading experts on the region, and they were all saying basically the same thing: (1) the conflict was not going to be easy, (2) the region would likely collapse into sectarian conflict, and (3) Saddam was not a danger to the United States. It wasn't a big secret - like Democrats *and* Republicans want to argue - that he possessed no nuclear weapons and wasn't associated with Al-Qaeda. And, while some debate existed about whether he still had chemical agents, Saddam showed every sign of wanting to cooperate with UN inspection teams. I just don't buy into this argument that everybody was bamboozled by the Bush administration. If a 23 year-old college student thought something was fishy, Hillary Clinton was perfectly aware of what was going on. \n\nI don't think the decision to vote for authorization to invade Iraq invalidates her candidacy, but she needs to answer some hard questions about it.

Many or most Nader voters didn\'t give a shit about that sort of thing. I don\'t understand this emotional need for liberals to constantly shoot themselves in the foot by attacking those slightly more to the left of them whenever they lose. It\'s like they\'re too scared to fight their actual enemy, and instead would rather find somebody weaker to pick on and move ever farther to the right.\n\nHave you noticed that almost everybody on the left has now wholeheartedly adopted the "deficit=bad" frame originally created by far right strategists as part of their starve the beast strategy?  Republicans know that it\'s bullshit. That\'s why every time they\'re in power, they expand military spending and cut taxes for the rich, and then use it to cajole Democrats into not doing anything to help the working class whenever they\'re in power.\n\nThe Clintons don\'t give a shit. They\'ll eat that neoliberal crap for breakfast. It\'s how Bill won his first presidential election - by stealing it from Perot and then using it to continue Reagan-era economic policies. Maybe he had to in hindsight. But there\'s no reason to keep doing that bullshit now. We don\'t need to cave in to Stockholm syndrome and elect another Clinton when we have multiple other candidates in the Dem primary who are vastly more electable than her, in a nation that really doesn\'t want to vote in another Republican president. So let\'s not give them a DINO Clinton.'

Perot didn't win, but his policy issue got to the table.\n\nClinton was not so serious about the deficit once he got into office, Republicans shut down the government twice during his term over budget issues. To be fair, in the end Clinton did work with them and was more responsible on the budget than either Bush that came before and after him. Most of Ross Perot's issues were ignored though. Neither Dems nor Republicans pushed his idea about having private equity (small businesses) taxed at a lower rate than publicly traded shares or reforming corporate creative accounting practices either. Clinton was much more friendly to Wall St. than Perot would have been- he shares some of the responsibility for loose lending practices at Fanny and Freddy. \n\n "

So theres a partisan gap, although not as large of one as some political commentators might assert. There are white racists in both parties. By most questions, they represent a minority of white voters in both parties. They probably represent a slightly larger minority of white Republicans than white Democrats.\n\nThe quote you\'re giving is hard to understand.

Bottom line, though, is that the gap in \'12 is 8 points while the gap in \'04 and \'06 was only 4 points and thus within the margin of error. \n\nWhen looking at the graphic they provide: http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-index-racial-92.png\n\nIt seems pretty clear to me that there\'s been a consistent gap between democrats and republicans on this issue.

aS'I literally stood up and cheered for this. Sanders has to be one of the greatest candidates in a century.\n\n\nHere\'s my perspective. Will Bernie Sanders win the election? Absolutely not. Everybody knows that, even he knows it himself. But that doesn\'t mean he can\'t share his ideas, his perspectives, his views points and what he strives to change in the nation with the rest of us. I think his greatest goal right now is to win the support of enough citizens (primarily Democrats) to scare Clinton and steer her in his direction, and by doing which, squeezing some of his ideas and policies in with the compromises she makes for the public. \n\n\n\nI love how he is taking inspiration from the Eastern European countries that have always held their own subtle bragging rights over us. I believe that because many of them have never been in complete "leadership" of the world positions but are still entirely developed and self sufficient as countries, that they were able to shift to the peaceful positions where they stand, and focus on correcting their economy and educational system. Ending the nonsense wars isn\'t going to make changes, but pulling ourselves out of them will. So what if another jihadist blows up an Iranian school? I hate to sound insensitive, but that should only effect the people it directly effects, the state of Iran. Just an example, but to me it seems perfectly logical. We need to back the hell off and stop trying to be the Global Police. I mean, people wonder why these extremists in other countries hate and target us the most, it\'s because we stick our noses in business that doesn\'t concern us when we have issues of our own to attend to.\n\n\nThe greatest overall problem with the government today (in my eyes) however, is the corruption that people are not widely accused of - religious bias. If you base ANY decisions you make politically off your beliefs, that should be morally wrong and unAmerican. Sadly it\'s nearly the opposite with all these hard-headed old white Republicans shutting down the freedoms our country should have been guaranteed to, such as gay marriage and stopping the forced mention of God in national anthems and pledges. The latter being less important, but still quite an issue overall. Then everything from there gets back into economics and overseas actions, but that is a whole new ball game.'

These are the types of things that the 'old' Republicans are against, and the younger more rational Republican voters are for. What will not change, however, is the economic platform. I feel as though the Democrats will move slightly more to the left than they already are, and the Republicans will pretty much stay firmly in the far right. Neither economic stance is inherently bad. What I just wish would happen is the average voter actually using their brain and to stop voting on single issues."

aS"&gt;Republicans have been gaining black votes from Democrats at a fairly steady albeit slow pace\n\nThey spent a ton of money and managed to appeal to a small number, which you could also argue may have always been conservative to a degree but didn't vote for Republicans for some obvious reasons.

Not always true, but there seems to be a very strict line of advancement stemming from smoke filled rooms if I had to make a guess. \n\nFor the Republicans, you have parts of the party actively fighting against each other. They are less united than the Democrats in the 60s and 70s. Primaries are a big fucking deal for Republicans, and its the kind of thing where the party is not consulted in some cases if someone wants to take a run at the national spotlight. For the Presidency, sure, that is still controlled by the smoke filled rooms. But the Republicans basically send anyone and everyone who cares enough to run on a national level to do so. That is why they have so many inexperienced politicians beholden to different party factions and are so gaffe prone. The Republican whip is a joke and has been ever since the GOP House Leadership left in 2006-2008. There is a reason why someone like Joni Ernst for the Republicans made a run for the Senate with scant experience (and won because of sheer incompetence by her opponent- don't fucking insult farmers in Iowa, you moron) and the Democrats would have buried someone like that at a county executive type post.\n\n"

aS'&gt;The more partisan a state is, the more difficult it is both politically and geographically to remedy vote skews.\n\nWhich is why I wonder why Texas often gets so much flack for gerrymandering.\n\nState | VS | SW | SE | Dif\n---|---|---|---|---\nTX | 33% | 33% | 33% | 0\n\nFriggin *Texas* -- miracle of election miracles -- manages to be a "blowout" state and still deliver roughly-proportional results.\n\n&gt;The difference between California and the 8 states I listed is that California is not a swing state. It is fairly consistently split 60/40.\n\nThat\'s true. I added Maryland in an edit a few minutes after posting my comment, but it seems it was too late for you to notice. MD is also more partisan than any of the states you listed, but that election wasn\'t much more one-sided than Indiana, which appeared on your list.\n\nActually, wait -- where did your data for Indiana come from? Because I just looked up their last election, and Ds got 37% of the vote, not 46%, winning the same number of seats (22%). So that\'s quite comparable to the California results the same year. It looks like you\'re using 2012 results, not 2014 results. Which is fine, I suppose, but one election isn\'t sufficient to call a state one of the "worst gerrymandered".\n\n&gt;In 4 of those states the Dems actually won\n\nWhile that\'s true -- they didn\'t win by as much. I see a consistent slight increase in the D proportion of the votes versus the data I have. PA 50% instead of 51%, WI 50% instead of 51%, and MI 51% not 53%.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Pennsylvania,_2012  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Wisconsin,_2012  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Michigan,_2012  \n\nThat doesn\'t change the essence of your point -- they still had a very slightly majority, but I\'d like to see data across several elections before I write off a state as badly-gerrymandered. There are two essential flaws in comparing PR-style results to actual FPTP results: FPTP exacerbates the effect of random perturbations, and the surety of victory discourages voter participation in "safe" districts (regardless of whether a district is safe due to gerrymandering or natural borders).\n\nETA: Also, while I\'m not familiar with the districting history of the other states, I am familiar with NC\'s. The worst-gerrymandered districts which skew the results were initially created by a Democratic legislature in the 90s for their own political reasons. The recent Republican-led redistricting certainly exacerbated the problem, but their issues are a lot more complex than simply looking at one election result and concluding that the Republicans gerrymandered the state in their favor.'

Put another way: They are closer than the dems at believing that only a select few are good at ruling, and the rest would fuck it up. (You can often see this directly: "The problem with voting is that everyone can vote", a paraphrase of, I think, Winston Churchhill? Conservatives I know love quoting that . . . along with "Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what\'s for dinner", which I hadn\'t realized for years wasn\'t referring to the lower-class as the sheep)\n\n\nThey aren\'t interested in idealistic concepts like freedom of speech, or an empowered, informed public, or equal power (choose any type of equality), or the ability of the voter to push issues, none of this stuff. \n\nThey may be interested in certain outcomes of ideas, and they\'ll gladly use them, but they won\'t stand behind the ideas themselves (See: Free speech &amp; Chelsea Manning). \n\nSo what they\'re really trying to do is make the voters think that what they already intend to do is a good idea, so that voters will tell them to do it, so they can do it. Which gets complicated to think about often, because \'they\' isn\'t only the politicians here, it\'s also the common voter themself. Because they think they\'re good at ruling, and that the majority of other people aren\'t. \n\n . . . and thus, misinformation. \n\nTL;DR: Republicans aren\'t nearly as stupid as non-republicans think they are.

I mainly find that trend interesting because the reasons for it seem to carry some weight. Small / medium grievances build up over 6-8 years and the president in power get casted onto that president's party, and you can see this in the 2nd term losses that the president's party takes. I think only during Clinton's 2nd term did a party not lose seats during a president's 2nd term, and that may be because he held a high approval rating and the Republicans focused too much on the Lewinsky scandal that no one cared much about.\n\nOr in short: A president probably has to be popular (60%+ or more approval) for his party to do well in elections from his mid-2nd term and next presidential election. Hard to maintain a high approval rating in a country divided ideologically, and especially with an opposition-controlled Congress.\n"

They had a game plan.  They had dirt.  She had a long record in public life and they figured that it could be turned against her.  The black dude?  Shit.  They had no game plan if he got into the race.  \n\n\nSo they lined up behind Hillary.  They wanted her to win the nomination so that they could tear her down.  If she actually won the nomination (and let's be honest, any Democrat running in 2008 was pretty much a lock for the White House) they could spend the next four or eight years making money off her.\n\n\nThe entire right wing media apparatus - from Rush Limbaugh to Fox News - was built during the Bill Clinton years.  If they couldn't hold onto the Presidency (and they couldn't), then they damned well sure could make a lot of money off the result of a Hillary Clinton administration.\n\n"

This means they need more and more conservative candidates to be able to compete with the Republican candidate that gets moved far right. That\'s how we get presidents like Obama, who was touted as being liberal, when really he\'s wildly conservative compared to most Democratic ideals. He just seems liberal compared to how far right the Republicans have been able to pull our political views.\n\nSo, Jeb thinks comments like these will get him elected. He\'s wrong.

Then, once he had the nomination, he was back on his middle ground for most stuff.

There are no laws limiting hard-on drugs or condoms, only FEMALE birth control is evil, because women who have sex are evil (kinda makes you wonder whom Republicans think men should have sex with, if sexually active women are the DEBBULLL, but I digress).\n\nThe fight is now, not in ten years when Americans get fed up enough to try something different. You may have no daughters of childbearing age. I do, and I am scared to death for her. And it isn\'t Democrats causing my angst.\n\nIf you have the luxury of envisioning some new utopian party, count yourself fortunate.\n\nEdit to add: male SEXUAL freedom IS under attack, if said males are gay. Just want to note that this is also why the Republicans are the WRONG party.'

aS"This is ridiculous.\n\nDo you think a business should be allowed to forbid black people in their shop? Do you think a catering company should be allowed to refuse servicing an interracial marriage?\n\nWhat you're getting at is the struggle between equality under the law vs. freedom of contract. But we already have federal laws in place that mandate businesses with a certain number of employees must comply with non-discrimination policies. I don't see you or Republicans raging about federal laws mandating that most companies not be allowed refuse service based on race.\n\nFor example, Title VII prohibits any business from discriminating on the basis of race if your company has 15 or more employees. Other federal laws like the ADA, ADEA, the EPA, and GINA also have these threshold requirements because no one (who should be taken seriously) is advocating that literally all small businesses should be forced to contract with anyone who walks through their door.\n\nIf you're a baker or a florist or a photograper it's unlikely that any proposed federal anti-discrimination statute would apply to you. But if you have a big enough company and you hold yourself out the public under the protection and advantages of state and federal laws, it's reasonable to apply federal and state anti-discrimination practices to your business.\n\nI think it's disgusting, no matter how big or small your business, to refuse service to someone because they're black, or a woman, or disabled. I think it's just as disgusting if a business refuses service for a gay couple/person. If a small business decides to do any of those things, they'll have to bear the shame of it AND the likelihood that their business will be boycotted (like the one in Indiana). And before you get outraged by that, consider for a moment that that's exactly what capitalism is supposed to be about: using your purchasing power to decide which business you support and those that you don't."

aS'&gt; Allowing complete public access would then allow any company in the United States to use their political connections and delay the treaty; someone, somewhere, is going to be unhappy with the treaty and will fight tooth and nail to stop it from becoming legitimate. This is just in one country, the TPP spans across the entire Pacific and, since the majority of those nations have similar democratic processes, the same could be done in each respective nation. The Treaty will absolutely never be passed with that much bickering and arguing simply because nobody wants to be the loser of a deal. At times we must accept, as a society, that the greater good is more important than some individuals. \n\nWhy are you assuming that the TPP is for the "greater good"?  It could just as easily be a net loss for the people of the countries involved.\n\nYes, it will be difficult to pass a massive omnibus treaty like the TPP if we allow full democratic input from all member countries.  Why is that a bad thing?  Maybe that should tell us that we should focus on smaller, concise, comprehensible treaties instead of trying to ram through as much stuff as possible in one go.\n\n&gt; What I can\'t seem to understand is that all the people here, so called "progressives", seem to support opening the treaty to public yet just a few years earlier, they also supported pushing through single-payer option in Healthcare.\n\nWho is saying that, specifically?  It seems to me that the TPP should be subject to *at least* as much democratic scrutiny as the ACA was.  Instead we\'re going to allow the TPP to breeze through congress without a fight?\n\n&gt; They were mad about how gutted the actual ACA Bill was and claimed Obama had betrayed them: Republicans should never have been given a chance to destroy the bill. \n\nAllowing congress to debate TPP isn\'t going what\'s going to allow Republicans to destroy it.

aS"&gt;Do you think a business should be allowed to forbid black people in their shop?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt;Do you think a catering company should be allowed to refuse servicing an interracial marriage?\n\nCircumstances... but no probably not.\n\n&gt;What you're getting at is the struggle between equality under the law vs. freedom of contract.\n\nNo not really. This has little to do with equality under the law. Heck, even a ban on gay marriage can be argued as equality under the law, since it applies equally to all.\n\n&gt;But we already have federal laws in place that mandate businesses with a certain number of employees must comply with non-discrimination policies. I don't see you or Republicans raging about federal laws mandating that most companies not be allowed refuse service based on race.\n\nThere's a lot more nuance to it than that. Simply put: if I felt that allowing caterers and photographers to refuse gay wedding business would effectively force homosexuals into a second class where they would be unable to enjoy the same basic life experiences as a heterosexual, then I would support criminalizing this kind of discrimination. But I don't think this is the case. Rather, it seems more like wanting to use the law to force people to stop being something you don't like.\n\n&gt;If you're a baker or a florist or a photograper it's unlikely that any proposed federal anti-discrimination statute would apply to you.\n\nTrue, but I also think that businesses in general simply refusing service to homosexuals wouldn't fall under any of the proposed legislation, either. Like the Indiana law; you have to be able to make a believable case that having a homosexual eat at your restaurant is against your religion, which isn't likely possible. The way such laws are written, they are designed to apply only to cases that are a bit more understandable, like being an active participant in a ceremony that conflicts with a recognized religious belief."

aS"&gt;Btw, why doesn't Bernie Sanders join Paul in this filibuster?\n\nBecause this is about the role of large overbearing government should play in our lives. Sanders believes that government is good, and can do everything for everyone. This is a filibuster on large government more than anything, of which Sanders is a proponent of.\n\nSanders is also an extremely partisan politician, and has one of the worst track records for working across the aisle. He has specifically gone after Republicans that hold some of the same views he has, for just being Republicans. He will go out of his way to not work with Republicans, even if he has the same views and beliefs with them.\n\nThe most recently is Loretta Lynch. He criticized Republicans for being against her nominations, saying they had no real reason to be opposed to her nomination. When, many Republicans, especially Rand, were against her because of Asset Forfeiture. Lynch is a Wall St. insider, and is extremely soft on financial criminals, you think he would join with Republicans and add that to the debate, but nope, he criticized Republicans, then applauded when he rubber stamped her nomination and blamed Republicans that it took so long.\n\nSanders is nothing but a partisan hack, and embodies everything that is wrong in Washington, by not working together with other parties."

Balanced Budget, life at conception, views on homosexual marriage (though he at least admits there are economic points to it), want to abolish the Federal Reserve, and flat tax...\n\nWait, no, nevermind...

But, she pretty much let foreign banks go free after they were actually convicted of illegal activities.\n\nMany Republicans were against her for just this reason, Paul specifically didn't vote for her over this reason. You think that Sanders would have been with them over her ruining legal small American businesses, while letting big banks get away with actual crimes, but nope, he specifically criticized Republicans over this exact issue, rubber stamped her nomination without question, applauded when she was voted in, then still criticizes Republicans for making it take so long to get her into office.

p1617
aS"The fact that most media leans more on the liberal side is why this article was written. For Democrats, it's a common tactic when selling candidates to let people know how important their vote is. That's because Democrats have a smaller electorate whose vote they KNOW they can depend on (people who vote every 2 years), and a bigger electorate who they know will vote Dem but have to be motivated to go vote (people who vote every 4 years). For Republicans, it's the other way around. They have a huge electorate they can rely on to vote every 2 years, but don't have the number of sporadic voters that Democrats have.  \n\nExplaining how important their vote is, how important this election is, how they can change the world with their vote...is literally in every DCCC field training script. That's because higher voter turnout typically equals a Democrat win. This is why Republicans are always trying to pass voter restriction laws (voter ID laws, closing the polls earlier).\n\nI'm really glad all you people care about politics enough to be paying attention at this point in the game. The VAST majority of people are not like that. People are dumb and don't pay attention. The reason money matters so much is because of media. The more you get your name out, the more you attack your opponent, the more often you take name recognition polling, the better chance you'll have at winning. That's why Bernie Sanders won't win. He won't have the money to do this. \n\nYou hate those annoying politics ads? Too bad, they move polling number like nothing else. You know what kind of politics ads move polling numbers in favor of a candidate the most? Negative attack ads on their opponents. Media appearances, commercials, ads on websites that are specially designed for the demographics of the region you live in (also every time you click on those ads, the campaign has to pay the ad service money). That's what a lot of campaign money goes toward. Talking points that don't answer questions, commercials, all the things you probably hate about campaigns will never change because THEY WORK.\n\nOn the other hand, the less money you spend, the more money you have left over in your war chest to work with the next election cycle if you win.

aS'&gt; I\'m taking from this that you are one of the people who believes that Hillary Clinton wants to work to rectify the injustice of maldistribution. \n\nAll this sounds a bit too much like "Claude Hooper Bukowski" who believes in God and believes that God believes in Claude.  I don\'t think anyone is that naive. \n\nI think Hillary would favor ending maldistribution.  I think that the roots of maldistribution in the US go back to Nixon, that Nixon was a violation of the good that some Republicans had done, and by some I refer to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, and that during the Eisenhower period and then Kennedy-Johnson period the US had made dramatic strides toward reducing maldistribution.\n\nNo person is all good or all bad, although Nixon was certainly a prototype of evil and much of the problem of rising maldistribution we have faced and face today appear at least to be related to Republicans who followed Ford.\n\nBut part of the problem of rising maldistribution was because of the success at reducing maldistribution that America had experienced up to and including Lyndon Johnson: successes like recovery from the depression, like the GI Bill, like the end of racism in sports but these became associated with Johnson and with the Democratic party.  Johnson too did great things for civil rights.  But as result, Republicans formed a coalition against Johnson based on increasing maldistribution. And various outgrowths of the Republican party since Nixon have geared toward increasing maldistribution "in reaction to" what Johnson and the Democrats had achieved, because the Republican party could capture a a huge reactionary movement against civil rights.   Objectively you could not say that Johnson and the Democrats were "united" at their core on many issues, they were largely united in support of economic freedom for all  including those who had been wrongfully oppressed.   \n\nThe Republican view was that they could create a party by trying to stop this and thus became opposed to any efforts like the GI-Bill, like dual-use and its ability to provide research education which themselves provide both business and military research and capable entrants into the growth economy, and therefore competitive advantage for the United States.  Thus the efforts of Republicans, regardless belief or slogan wind up as both a full attack on the economic advantage of the United States, an abuse and ultimate deterioration of military power, an attack on economic freedom and an attack on sustainability.\n \nToday  I hear the RW deplore terms like democracy and equality and one-man one vote, which are  words I grew up with that I associate mathematically with the very strength of this country.  But their attack on these words, as ideologically based as they may seem are an attack on the strength and resilience of the United States.\n\nDoes Bernie Sanders understand all of that?  Maybe.  But if we think that some single politician is "God" and God believes in Claude, that is not likely to prove correct or useful whether its Sanders or Clinton or whoever.   \n'

Paul and Lee didn't vote for her specifically because of asset forfeiture, and Cruz didn't vote for her because of her use of prosecutorial discretion. \n\n\nIf anything Democrats should have used that opportunity to show some bipartisanship. Isn't being tough on banks Sanders and Warrens big issue? Warren basically called Republicans sexist for holding up her nomination, and Sanders rubber stamped her nomination without question, while criticizing Republicans who stood up for their beliefs, while going against his.\n\nThe only reason banks are getting away with BS, is because the Democratic party rubber stamps everything Obama does, instead of actually questioning things he does that goes against their beliefs."

aS"&gt;Alright, I'm genuinely curious if someone can provide a source for climate change being 100% man made (as the comments in this post imply). \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of peer reviewed scientific studies out there, but NASA has some good data and write ups on it if you are really interested.  But it isn't 100% man made.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;I was under the impression that almost everyone was on the same page that man-made C02 pollution contributes to climate change. But contributing to and being the sole reason for are two very different things. \r\n\r\nScientifically literate people are.  The deniers and the republicans come in 3 basic camps:\r\n\r\n1. The climate is not changing at any other rate than it has in the past\r\n\r\n2. The climate is changing but it isn't due to man made activity\r\n\r\n3. The climate is changing due to man made activity but it is too costly/impossible to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans are typically in the 1st and 2nd camps, but there are a few in the 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;The climate would change without any human intervention due to natural causes, for example: changes in the earths orbit.\r\n\r\nThe earth's orbit isn't changing. . . so I'm not sure where you got that idea.  But yes, the earth's climate goes through cycles over tens of thousands of years.  There have been many ice ages and warming periods throughout Earth's history.  However, the Anthropological Climate Change theory states that human activity is **expediting** that process.  \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;People talk about climate change as if preventing human caused climate change would lead to the Earth having the same climate indefinitely. From what I understand this is just not true. If you were to undo all human-caused climate change and prevented it from ever happening again you would need to take extra steps beyond that to prevent the climate from changing due to natural causes.\r\n\r\nI have not seen a single peer reviewed paper making this claim.  The idea is to slow it down and return it to a natural level to allow for a more gradual change instead of a rapid rise in sea level."

They might interpret the climate debate as something that can/should be stopped completely because they don\'t know anything other than the typical talking points form their favorite political party.  \r\n\r\nThe fact is, this isn\'t a scientific debate, it\'s a political one.  Scientifically speaking, there\'s a pretty solid scientific consensus that humans are impacting the climate.  The political debate SHOULD BE if we should do anything about it or not.  Are we too far gone?  Is it more cost effective to deal with the changes than to disrupt our economic system?  How should we deal with it?\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of political questions to be had, but Republicans aren\'t offering a solution, just trying to stick their head in the sand and deny the science.  The Democrat solution is carbon cap and trade.  I would love to hear another solution from Republicans, but they refuse to address it and provide one.'

aS"If I thought it would help, I'd vote for him in the primary.  \n\nWhere I think you and I would agree, is that there is a problem with the system we have now, as it seems as though there is a possibility of a rehash of 1992; Bush vs. Clinton.  I'm pretty opposed to the dynasty thing.  \n\nI would venture to say that Hillary, and all of her baggage, is probably going to survive primary process.  Martin O'Malley is pretty disliked within his own state, campaigned heavily on gun control (goodbye southern swing states) and will likely crater as he's trying to commandeer a sector of the base Hillary already commands.  \n\nSanders can unify the far left of the Democrat base, but those blue-dog Democrats aren't going to go for him (and as you venture from the North-East and Pacific Coast, they become far more prevalent).  He's going to have some real problems in Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada (which constitute 75% of the first four primaries).  When we get to Super Tuesday, he's probably not going to carry the following states: Colorado caucuses, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and North Carolina.  He's going to be so far behind by that point that I can't imagine he stays in the race.  \n\nI'm personally going for Rand Paul and I think that he has a better shot, though still not good, than Sanders does of getting the Nomination.  The Republican field is a hell of a lot deeper at this point than the Democrats, so I can't guess how it will go.  However, it's safe to say that the establishment favors Jeb Bush and to a lesser extent Scott Walker (and then Marco Rubio).  The Republicans are in a bit of a civil war so it is feasible that a dark horse could emerge, but we'll see. \n\nThat being said, the Rand Pauls' and Bernie Sanders are likely there solely to steer the national conversation; which while I abhor Sanders' fiscal policies, I agree with him on a lot of Social and Civil Rights issues.  \n\nThat's my take on things though, because if we end up with another Clinton Bush ticket, that would mean that for at least 41 years of my life on this planet (at the time of the end of that term) I would have seen presidents from only 4 families (Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama.  An argument could be made that I saw Carter in the White House, but only for a few months and I 6 months old when he left office) in the White House and only three families since I was 9 years old.  That's certainly a problem. \n"

aS'&gt; Voting for her simply because she is a woman is a terrible perversion of the political process.\n\nExcept I just quite clearly said that I wouldn\'t do that, and I really don\'t think anyone else would, either.    \n\nI think the fact that she\'s a woman doesn\'t really matter very much in this election, either for her or against her, and I\'m delighted that we\'ve finally made enough progress that that\'s true.   No one is going to vote for her just because she\'s a woman, not unless they actually agree with her politics; some people probably will vote against her just because she\'s a woman, but probably most of those people are conservatives who wouldn\'t have supported anyone with her politics anyway so it shouldn\'t make much of a difference in the end (except perhaps in the level of vitriol that I expect to see aimed at her from the right).  \n\nThis "people only support her because she\'s a woman" is the exact same false narrative that Republicans tried to drum up for 8 years about Obama when they claimed that "people only supported him because he was black"; it was nonsense then, and it\'s nonsense now.

aS"What surprises me is that there are so few Democrat hopefuls.  We're still about a year and a half out from the elections and about a little less than a year from the first of the primaries.  There were 7 or 8 (I'm ballparking) contenders for the Democrat nomination in 08.  Some drop out before they even hit the primaries due to a lack of money and/or support.  What's strange to me is that we have three people so far on the Democrat side, Sanders, O'Malley and Clinton.  \n\nWhat that says to me (and this is just my perspective) is that the Democrat's establishment views this nomination as Hillary's because it is her turn.  O'Malley is likely in this to start making a national name for himself (which is common, I think Reagan ran one or two times before he won the nomination), Romney ran how many times prior 2012?  The lack of competition for Hillary really makes me wonder why there is so little competition (though it is still early).  \n\n\nA lot of the Republicans base are the byproduct of the cold war and they over-exaggerate the domestic threat of ISIS (for example).  Growing up in a time when we teetered on the brink of nuclear holocaust and going through drills in school where you prepared (by getting under your desk) for a Soviet nuclear attack, it's understandable.  Hence the inflated military spending (which I agree with you on btw.  We need a formidable military, we don't need one the size we have now).  \n\nI'm something of an isolationist (which is why I like Rand Paul).  If there is a direct threat to America or her allies, then we have to get involved, but I don't think we need to go invade some third world shithole every few years.  The Republicans are pretty bad about this but so are the Democrats.  We were playing both sides of the Syria conflict for awhile.  We helped overthrow and destabilize the Libyan government (Qaddafi wasn't really a threat to us), etc.  Bush certainly played a large role in getting the Middle East to the state that it is in, but Obama's handling of the situation was certainly less than stellar as well.  \n\nThe whole religious freedom thing that has been going on with the gay wedding cakes is an interesting view into the difference between Republican and Democrat views on social issues.  The Republican view is that if one owns a business and provides a good or a service to someone, then they should have the right to refuse to do business that goes against their moral conscience.  I may not agree with them that gay marriage is immoral, but I respect their right to do so without government intervention (though if the public lambasts them on social media and they lose enough business as a result that they go under, I'm not necessarily that sympathetic to their plight).  The Democrats believe that a business owner should not have the right to refuse service to someone if they are members of a protected class (gays, minorities, adherents of a different religion, etc).   On it's face, that doesn't sound like such a bad view until you flip it around.  Should a gay baker be forced, under penalty of the law, to cater a luncheon put on by the Westboro Baptist Church (a despicable religion but a religion nonetheless)?  The customer in both instances is a member of a protected class.  I would rather we not force bigots to hide their bigotry in silence and instead allow them to voice it in public (where we can shame them and not support them by patronizing their businesses).  I'm in an interracial relationship and the father of a biracial kid.  I would rather not give my business to someone who loathes me and my family but can't voice that opinion in public.  I think we've evolved enough as a society (as evidenced by that pizza shop shutting down for refusing to cater to homosexuals) to take care of that without government intervention.  \n\nThat being said, I don't believe that marriage is a federal issue and should be handled by the states, so my anger at the lack of progress on that front lies with the Republicans at the state level politicians and not the federal.  I opposed the Protection of Marriage Act for the same reason.  \n\nThat's just my take on things, your mileage may vary.  \n"

The sample is non-group, i.e., people with insurance other than employer.\n\nOf them, 59% have a Marketplace plan, 7% are still buying direct from the insurance company  (though now it\'s now ACA-compliant), 16% have their "you can keep your insurance" non-compliant plans, and 17% don\'t know if they bought their plan in the Marketplace or not (jesus, people).\n\nSo, a minimum 23% don\'t have Market Plans.  I suspect there are a bunch of Obamacare-hatin\' Republicans squirreled away in this group, so it\'s probably not entirely hypocrisy.\n\nThere\'s really not enough information provided for the author to frame it this way, but it\'s still an interesting read.

And, no surprise, the non ACA-compliant "you can keep your insurance" people are 3 times more likely to report that they\'ve had problems paying bills or getting medicine...and more than twice as likely to report that they didn\'t seek needed care because of the cost.

Instead, we send in experts to negotiate things for us\n\n3) Building off of #2, we might be giving a little more to the smaller countries, like Brunei, to access resources.  This is necessary in the short term, and buys us some more time to smooth over the transition to green energy even more.  This would also be seen poorly.\n\n4) We have countries at the negotiating table that we rarely talk to.  These deals are as much about building relationships as they are about the economies of the countries in place.  The last thing our leaders would want is everyone treating this trade agreement like it\'s specifically a business deal, downplaying the fact it\'s also about becoming friends.  This sends off negative vibes.'

Now we are zooming away from the fact that government services create a framework of laws to protect us against capitalism, to whether those services are any good. \n\nIf government services are deficient it is because of corruption of money influences, purposeful underfunding of vital programs to make private options seem more attractive, or some other form of capitalist interference, usually by dogmatically capitalist Republicans. Amtrak is a prime example of a service that would be modern and useful if it were properly funded. We need only look at other countries successful rail programs to prove it is workable. The problem is that Amtrak is being set up to fail on purpose, like the Post Office and its bullshit 75 year pension funding requirement. People who take trains do not buy gas for their cars, therefore Amtrak must die, says the oil baron. \n\nYou will now ignore this fact and instead bring up a new topic, if your past behavior is any indication.

Right now the only thing holding back Republicans is the Christian right. If Republicans could shed the anti-science, anti-gay reputation that comes with pandering to religious conservatives, they could run solidly on foreign policy and individual rights. The fact that Huckabee doesn't seem to care that he's hurting fellow Republicans by aligning himself with zealots is indicative that this is 1) personal to him.

aS"&gt; TRADE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT TREATIES, but rather regulating international commerce is a specific job of the Congress\n\nTrade agreements are treaties and were treated as such up until Ronald Reagan and Republicans redefined them to circumvent the legislative process which didn't favor their economic agenda.  Reagan and Republicans should have been called out for that BS.  If you had taken the time to read that article instead of setting your hair on fire, you would have picked up on that history lesson.  Here's what you missed:\n\n&gt;Until 1979, every trade agreement that the U.S. had with any nation or nations was a treaty not only in reality but in name  recognized as such. However, in 1979, the U.S. signed the first international trade agreement that the U.S. refused to call a treaty, the Tokyo Round GATT. That sort of thing has happened only four more times, the biggest being NAFTA. And yet even after 1979, the vast majority of international trade agreements to which the U.S. was a signatory were called, even by the U.S., as treaties. \n\nBeyond that history lesson, what makes you think Congress can effectively *regulate international commerce* when it is denied timely access to trade agreement content and Fast Track authority limits the due diligence to such a short period that it also can't be done effectively?  Are you suggesting that this joke of a review period is Constitutionally compliant?  Seriously?  By your standard, Fast Track authority and the legislative review process are still violating the very spirit and letter of the Constitution even if we ignore your treaty concerns and Global Research.  \n\nA word of advice...try challenging the pertinent message, not the messenger in the future.

The rise of **Foxnews** has distorted the policies of the GOP and filled the people that control the GOP's primary process and vote in it with completely ridiculous ideas and a platform that completely wilts in the light of day.  We would never have had an Iraq war without Foxnews beating opponents of it into submission and questioning the patriotism of anyone who was against it, inside and outside the Republican party.\n\nThe second nuclear bomb to go off inside the Republican primary was **Citizen's United**, where suddenly a handful of huge moneyed interests suddenly had massive outsized control of the GOP, especially the primary process, because candidates desperately need huge amounts to out pander their opponents.  That's why you have almost the entire GOP field saying demonstrably stupid things like global warming is a myth.  \n\nThe left just plain doesn't have a controlling media organization like Foxnews that is split between selling salaciousness for profit and trying to help Republicans win, two goals that are completely at odds.  MSNBC has a tiny tiny fraction of the influence on the left that Fox does on the right.  And Citizen's United doesn't hurt the Dems nearly as bad because their financial backers are much more diverse than the Republicans.  Sure, Democratic candidates will possibly pander to their financial backers sometimes leading to untenable or laughable policy positions, but it hasn't created party-wide litmus tests like it has in Republican land.

Just like when she last ran for President. That huge drop among Republicans is what's having the effect on her overall numbers, and was entirely inevitable as she moved from her nonpartisan role as America's chief diplomat (a time when Republicans sung the Clintons' praises as a stick to beat Obama by comparison) to becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. She was always going to bitterly divide the country all over again.\n\nHer numbers among Democrats and independents has actually been remarkably stable this year, despite the relentless attacks she's getting.

Neither he nor his allies in the Tea Party are fond of the IMF. As a recent New York Times editorial noted, Republicans in Congress have refused to ratify changes to the I.M.F., which would have also increased its capital. They signaled that they would only vote for I.M.F. reforms if they got something in return from the administration, like changes in the 2010 health care reform law.

They can call A.L.E.C. anything they want.\n\nBut they're to blame.

There is a shockingly large portion of low-information voters who go along with anything a president they voted for supports. If you restrict that to more informed/engaged voters, those numbers are probably considerably more static. Though I think there is a legitimate increase in Republican opposition to issues like mass surveillance and the police state (aside from kneejerk anti-Obama stances), which Republicans had traditionally been huge fans of. Especially considering how embarrassing Congress has been of late, it's encouraging to see a burgeoning bipartisan coalition on those issues."

The cost of higher education has been changed from affordable to a prohibitive luxury item for students and student families as they have to no pay for 75% or more of the operating costs of research universities.\n'

The bullshit statistics conservatives cite are based on W2 income tax rates, which isn't how the rich actually take their money. They do it through capital gains, which are magically taxed at far lower rates than actual work income.\n\nHere's a [a video of what wealth distribution actually looks like in the United States](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM). It's a J-Curve, and you'd have to be an idiot to think that the people at the top end of that J-Curve are actually worth infinitely more than the bottom 80% of Americans in terms of their real contributions to the economy. That means they're taking more out of the economy than they're putting in.\n\nMost Americans radically underestimate just how unequal society is, and most Americans--including most Republicans--want society to be more equal than what they *think* society currently is.\n\nBecause you'd have to be a delusional libertarian ideologue to believe that when the top 1% own over 90% of the wealth, they actually *earned* all that money, and make geometrically more of a contribution to the economy as everyone else.\n\nThe game is rigged. Which means you can do one of two things: 1) take a fair amount of money out of them in taxes at the back end to adjust for the rigged game; or 2) change the rules of the game so they can't steal as much in the first place."

It\'s about calling them transparently selfish despite their pleas of contrived morality.\n\n&gt; Liberals, conservatives, libertarians, greenes ,etc all have some fucking dummies in the group.\n\nThey\'ve all got people with different motivations.  When you have different motivations, sometimes something perfectly intelligent to one person looks idiotic to another.  Different goals will yield different policies.\n\n&gt; We can debate the merits of each political outlook in a fair way, without pretending that the "Get Government Out Of My Medicare!" lady is speaking for most libertarians.\n\nShe\'s speaking for most Republicans.  The folks that speak for most Libertarians can be found at your local Libertarian State convention.  I\'ve been there.  I\'ve heard them speak.  And their goals are decidedly not my goals.  After several years working within the party, I discovered that it was just too much of a magnet for selfish and destructive people, many of whom believe they should be lauded for their brave proclamation of selfishness.\n\nIt\'s a dysfunctional group that can\'t work together towards even their shared goals, because they are too busy trying to out-selfish one another.  And I dread the day Americans decide to put a person like that anywhere near the Presidency.'

aS"&gt; yes, the wealthy pay less in taxes than the poor and middle class as a share of their overall wealth.\n\nYep, but they also pay a far greater share of the overall tax burden.\n\n&gt; Here's a a video of what wealth distribution actually looks like in the United States. It's a J-Curve, and you'd have to be an idiot to think that the people at the top end of that J-Curve are actually worth infinitely more than the bottom 80% of Americans in terms of their real contributions to the economy. That means they're taking more out of the economy than they're putting in.\n\nThe wealth distribution doesn't show the contributions to the economy at all.  \n\n&gt; Most Americans have radically underestimate just how unequal society is, and most Americans--including most Republicans--want society to be more equal than what they think society currently is.\n\nI'd argue most are aware.  Most just don't believe it's as big of a problem, if at all, as you do.\n\n&gt; Because you'd have to be a delusional libertarian ideologue to believe that when the top 1% own over 90% of the wealth, they actually earned all that money, and make over 100 times the contribution to the economy as everyone else.\n\nHow exactly did they not earn their money?  Did they literally steal it from everyone else?  If I start a business tomorrow, and people buy a bazillion of my products making me a billionaire, did I not earn that?  You have a really warped view of wealth in my opinion.  Wealth does not have a direct correlation to your value to the economy.  \n\nIf you can enlighten me as to how say, Bill Gates did not earn his wealth, I'd be more than willing to read it.  Your entire reply here is basically a bunch of fallacies with little backing, and the sources you do use don't back up the points you're trying to make with them."

aS'but hey, don\'t listen to me. Listen to [Amazon billionaire Nick Hanauer](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014.html):\n\n"Which is why the fundamental law of capitalism must be: If workers have more money, businesses have more customers. Which makes middle-class consumers, not rich businesspeople like us, the true job creators. Which means a thriving middle class is the source of American prosperity, not a consequence of it. The middle class creates us rich people, not the other way around.\nOn June 19, 2013, Bloomberg published an article I wrote called The Capitalists Case for a $15 Minimum Wage. Forbes labeled it Nick Hanauers near insane proposal. And yet, just weeks after it was published, my friend David Rolf, a Service Employees International Union organizer, roused fast-food workers to go on strike around the country for a $15 living wage. Nearly a year later, the city of Seattle passed a $15 minimum wage. And just 350 days after my article was published, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray signed that ordinance into law. How could this happen, you ask?\nIt happened because we reminded the masses that they are the source of growth and prosperity, not us rich guys. We reminded them that when workers have more money, businesses have more customersand need more employees. We reminded them that if businesses paid workers a living wage rather than poverty wages, taxpayers wouldnt have to make up the difference. And when we got done, 74 percent of likely Seattle voters in a recent poll agreed that a $15 minimum wage was a swell idea.\nThe standard response in the minimum-wage debate, made by Republicans and their business backers and plenty of Democrats as well, is that raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Businesses will have to lay off workers. This argument reflects the orthodox economics that most people had in college. If you took Econ 101, then you literally were taught that if wages go up, employment must go down. The law of supply and demand and all that. Thats why youve got John Boehner and other Republicans in Congress insisting that if you price employment higher, you get less of it. Really?\n\nBecause heres an odd thing. During the past three decades, compensation for CEOs grew 127 times faster than it did for workers. Since 1950, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio has increased 1,000 percent, and that is not a typo. CEOs used to earn 30 times the median wage; now they rake in 500 times. Yet no company I know of has eliminated its senior managers, or outsourced them to China or automated their jobs. Instead, we now have more CEOs and senior executives than ever before. So, too, for financial services workers and technology workers. These folks earn multiples of the median wage, yet we somehow have more and more of them.\n\nThe thing about us businesspeople is that we love our customers rich and our employees poor. So for as long as there has been capitalism, capitalists have said the same thing about any effort to raise wages. Weve had 75 years of complaints from big businesswhen the minimum wage was instituted, when women had to be paid equitable amounts, when child labor laws were created. Every time the capitalists said exactly the same thing in the same way: Were all going to go bankrupt. Ill have to close. Ill have to lay everyone off. It hasnt happened. In fact, the data show that when workers are better treated, business gets better. The naysayers are just wrong."'

You hate the Bush bailout caused by the Bush crash so you support the Tea Party -- which promotes politicians who have the exact same policies, goals, funders, and supporters as the Bushes.\n\nIt sounds like you are a liberal with a strong home-party affiliation to the Republicans. Politics is much like sports in that way. It's not about beliefs, it's about who you were raised to cheer for. \n\nI hope one day you can step back and see that while neither Democrats or Republicans are perfect and many from both sides take financial industry money, the clear choice of party for those who want to reign in the financial industry are the Democrats. One group that understands this well are the financial titans themselves. While they sometimes shift back and forth between Democrats and Republicans -- sometimes cynically sending money to the likely winner -- they have gotten the hint recently that the Republicans are their party. In the past 3 election cycles they have heavily favored Republicans, including Tea party candidates.\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/16/jim-demint/not-many-times-more-democrats-sometimes-do-raise-m/\n"

First, Bloomberg is rich, and you have to be rich to run for office. Second, Clinton and the Republicans are engaged in a "race from the center," leaving an opportunity for the sort of centrism that Bloomberg theoretically represents. After all, the millennials love centrism, right?\n\nHe then goes on to say:\n&gt;First of all, the rise of the Super PAC has made being a billionaire candidate less of an advantage...In the modern era of presidential politics, you don\'t need to be a billionaire, you just need to point friendly billionaires to the right place to drop off checks.\n\n&gt;Second, the idea that there is a great thirst for centrist politics is the recurring fever dream of wealthy Democrats. Surely, they think, there must be others who embrace business but hold socially moderate positions. And there are. Their names are Hillary Clinton and Andrew Cuomo.\n\nSo I guess if you were looking for a fairly wealthy pro-business socially moderate Democrat, you could back Michael Bloomberg. Or you could, you know, back someone who can win like Hillary Clinton, I guess.'

aS'&gt; So, if I understand the habits of you people correctly\n\nExcuse me?\n\nIt\'s interesting how the Post dissects one of the dozens of times Gruber said about masking the cost of Obamacare in order to get it passed. This article from the post would make sense - if that was the only quote we have a Gruber. And let us not forget our President himself who promised we could keep our doctors, which he knew to be a flat-out lie.\n\nIf this was a little bill, it probably wouldn\'t matter. But this was the biggest piece of legislature in the past 2-3 decades (maybe more), so you can\'t just throw your hands up in the air and say, "Oh haha that\'s how they do it in politics!".\n\n I\'d like to see Republicans say that when defending Bush\'s invasion of Iraq, and see how liberals take it. "haha yea we lied about WMDs. You know, people are stupid. If we told them the truth, we would have never been able to invade Iraq! HAHAHA"\n\nYea, I\'m sure you\'d think that\'s totally legit.\n\nAnd my initial comment was a joke. But it\'s also poking at liberals who are quoting an Republican Senator in a Liberal state who is now claiming the court cases are built on lies - that\'s a story here. But building the entire premise of Obamacare on lies? That\'s not a story. That\'s my point. They are connected in a way. And it\'s kind of worthless to be quoting a Republican is who likely just trying to appeal to her Democratic constituents in her state.'

aS"&gt;but when Republicans win suddenly it gerrymandering and magically when the dems inevitably win again we won't hear about gerrymandering for a while. \n\nBecause the House ***is*** gerrymandered towards the GOP, on the order of 6-8 percentage points of the popular vote in their favor.\n\nLook at 2012. 1.4 million more votes were cast for Dems, but the GOP took a 33-seat advantage.\n\nIt's hard to claim that that's a very representative government."

So red state congressional districts are far more gerrymandered then blue state ones. The Democrats actually got more votes for House candidates in 2012, but still have a significant minority of seats. Districts are redrawn after the decennial census, so new maps will be drawn in 2021. If the Democrats have more representation at the state level by then, then you're see more balanced maps and a possibility for a Democratic House. Otherwise, the Republicans will get to re-gerrymander the districts, and the House will probably stay red.\n\nAs for the Senate, it's because there are a lot of seats up that were taken in the Tea Party wave of 2010 and/or are in swing states, meaning that most of the in play seats will be Republican held.  Essentially the reverse of 2014.

aS'[\'global cooling\'](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-global-cooling-story-came-to-be/) was a serious thing for only a brief time, only a small number of scientists thought it would happen, and it was seriously blown out of proportion by an article in Newsweek in 1975. By 1980, most climate scientists agreed that carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere was causing an overall warming trend. \n\nHowever, it is still a favorite story for conservative talk show hosts to cite in order to prove their point that climate scientists don\'t know what they\'re doing. You\'re allowed to be skeptical in science, but you better have the data to back it up (which is why \'global cooling\' isnt a thing anymore). And they call it \'climate change\' to reflect all of the manifestations of increased atmospheric CO2, including acidification of the oceans and changing rainfall patterns.\n\n&gt;MOST conservatives are not against trying to mitigate climate change caused by humans. They are simply against massive changes to way and quality of life in order to do so\n\nThis is wrong. According to a recently released [Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/182807/conservative-republicans-alone-global-warming-timing.aspx?utm_source=CATEGORY_CLIMATE_CHANGE&amp;utm_medium=topic&amp;utm_campaign=tiles), 70% of conservative Republicans **do not** think human activities are responsible for climate change. \n\nAnd you are delusional if you think we can continue to go on with business as usual (i.e. burning all the coal and oil we can extract) and avoid catastrophic climate change. Most scientists think that we could stop burning fossil fuels today, but it\'s already too late to avoid some of the serious negative consequences. \n\nHuman activities have already raised atmospheric CO2 levels from 280 ppm to over 400 ppm (increase of ~43%) and there\'s no sign of slowing down. In geological terms, the last time this much CO2 was released in such a short time span was a result of volcanic activity during the [PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum), which resulted in (surprise) global warming and mass extinctions.\n\n&gt;Calling someone a denier shuts down coversation just as much as calling them racist. It shows how closed minded you are, not how closed minded they are.\n\nThis is a ridiculous statement... so the person that listens to scientific evidence is "narrow-minded"? Really? \n\nAnd yes, I think that the people who deliberately contribute to a *global* security threat (by purposefully perpetuating ignorance) are themselves a security threat. But I would not suggest we kill them all, as you have, but rather that we educate them, and shame the ones who still muddle the debate. We can\'t treat both sides of this debate as equals, because they aren\'t. One side has facts and evidence on their side, and the other side has only rhetoric, ignorance and in some cases, ulterior motives.'

aS'&gt;But nobody is studying their candidate.\n\nCorrect. Which is why when the news runs what will invariably be dozens of downticket Republicans saying things like "Women who get raped should see it as the sign from God it is!" and "Nobody has a right to be healthy unless you can afford it." voters will assign those beliefs onto the Republican nominee, and sink him in the general election.\n\nI realize you\'re agreeing with this sentiment, but it\'ll probably be a more powerful motivator than having a woman president.'

aS"Sanders isn't interesting. He's against Hillary, who has the pres locked up until at least the first primaries (just like last time) and common sense when looking at his history says he's not actually a serious candidate, especially with her having so much leverage with the party, he's basically Dennis Kucinich (as a character in the race, not in policy) and just as unelectable in a general. Right now the Democratic primaries aren't interesting.\n\nThe Republicans are interesting because there's no clear front runner so, arguably, it's *far* more important to know what differentiates them and what each persons platform is."

aS'&gt;For 50 years the one person, one vote principle has been used to try to equally distribute political power by counting all people in states and cities, and then putting them into election districts of roughly the same size.\n\nA fine myth, but one that just isn\'t true. Starting with the Senate where one person in Wyoming has equivalent voting power to over 50 Californians. This leads to our current majority of Senators who represent a minority of the people; while the Senate minority caucus represents a majority of people.\n\nThen we have the Electoral College - if we had a system of one person, one vote then Al Gore would be President, as he got over half a million more votes. But those over half a million votes from across the country were worth less than the votes of 537 people in Florida.\n\nhttp://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2000election.pdf\n\nAnd then there is gerrymandering which is being used to make some votes not as equal as other votes. More people voted for Democrats in House elections in 1996 and 2012, yet Republicans were put in charge because the smaller number of Republican votes was worth more than a larger number of Democratic votes.\n\nhttp://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1996election.pdf\n\nhttp://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2012election.pdf\n\n"one person, one vote" is a good principle, but it isn\'t in effect in America.'

Their ideological influences never really get dissected like this.

(They want roads, they want a good education system, they believe in regulation). However they are only moderately ok with wealth redistribution. They broadly speaking, believe in capitalism. \n\nBernie Sanders doesn't connect with them, Mayscare them, he yells a lot, he is always angry. \n\nClinton on the other hand, is just the type of Democrat they want.

The number of supporters for Sanders, S, is given by S=s\\*d\\*V, where s is the percentage of democratic (or democratic leaning) voters who support Sanders (taken from polling data), d is the percentage of democratic (or democratic leaning) voters among the general public (taken from polling data) and V is the total number of voters (taken from polling data). They do the same calculation for the other candidates. All of this seems valid to me, so if there's something about it which is invalid or illogical, can you explain it?\n\n&gt;the reason they're doing it is pretty clearly not one of fair air time\n\nI didn't say it was. They aren't arguing that Sanders should get more air time. They are simply stating that Sanders (who doesn't get a lot of air time) has more support than any four of the five least supported Republican candidates (who do get a lot of air time). If that makes you think Sanders should or should not get more air time, that's your own conclusion to draw. They are simply stating a statistical fact (acknowledging the limitations of the statistics involved), and the reason that they decided to investigate the statistics is because they noticed the Republicans getting a lot of media attention, while Sanders is getting comparatively less."

If you can believe it, the Republican budget throws 27 million Americans off health insurance, makes drastic cuts in Medicare, throws millions of low-income Americans, including pregnant women off of nutrition programs, and makes it harder for working-class families to afford college or put their kids in the Head Start program. And then, to add insult to injury, they provide huge tax breaks for the very wealthiest families in this country while they raise taxes on working families."\n\nI\'m gonna vote Democrat this election year. Not because I am democratic, but because I am so anti-republican because of the reasons above. Republicans pass tax breaks for millionaires while gutting from the middle and lower classes.\n\nThe GOP needs to shape up before they will get my vote.

Add more to that and that's what you're going to be paying for this (if it's free people will go to college that wouldn't with loans). \n\nDegree inflation. If a bachelor's or master is free, everyone would need that to compete and those with it wouldn't be special at all. Much like everyone is expected to clear high school because it's free, so it would go with college. We already see this because of how ubiquitous college is. Look at countries that pay, they have ways to keep a good portion out of college, that's how they do it. Are you willing to accept that, not getting a career you want because you didn't do quite well enough in high school? \n\nNo way to mandate a degree that has jobs. So we'd pay a ton for useless master's (useless as in 10,000 get them but there's 2,000 jobs). \n\nDoes it address the loan issue now? If not that's a lot of disenfranchised people with issues who are seeing him solve the problem for everyone else while leaving them to rot. Hello new Republicans. Politically it's a bad move, and paying off all the loans would be expensive. No win. \n\nI can keep going. This is one of the few issues I agree with Republicans on. \n\nEdit: I forgot you can solve some of the costs issues by passing them along to the states or by cutting other programs. In either case the likely losers are those with worse issues than middle/upper class college kids. I'd hate to see this funded on the backs of the poor.

Try suggesting a socialist idea like Bernie Sanders throws out at a conservative rally, and you\'ll be laughed out of there.  Forget the fact that conservative states are the overwhelming recipients of social welfare projects, they are always trying to cut these programs which is guaranteed to hurt their own people.

Democrats tend to live in urban areas where they have to socialize. \n\nIn other words, Republicans are stubborn about everything, and don't change their opinions often. They strive to be an individual that can make it on their own. Democrats can be stubborn, but generally will change their opinion if new information comes about.

You\'re getting so abstract now [that] you\'re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\'re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I\'m not saying that. But I\'m saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me  because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."'

Dems are supporting the keystone pipeline (not all but some).  Fracking has exploded in this country under a democratic president (and a democractic congress at one point).\n\n&gt; Most republicans in congress stand in the way of progress when it comes to infrastructure, liberty and equal rights for all Americans, and anything that makes logical sense from a longevity standpoint.\n\nDemocrats controlled congress and didn't pass marriage equality, didn't even vote on it.  Both democrat and republican presidents have held hands with saudi princes while human rights abuses abound in that country without saying a peep.  Hilary Clinton's Clinton foundation takes big money from them.  \n\n&gt; Most republican thinks its fucking grand to use congress as a tool for securing billions of dollars in goverment contracts for their friends. Dick Chaney and crew secured trillions of dollars of debt for this nation\n\nThe idea that democrats don't pork barrel or get government contracts is comical.  Gonna have to look that one up yourself, I can't even think of where to start on this one.  \n\n&gt; Most republicans in congress fully support the use of religion to justify dumb policy ideas and decisions to the determent of the country as a whole. That is what bothers me the most. We're the party of idoit's, ignorant's, and deniers because JESUS.\n\nObama goes to church, most politicians register as religious D or R.  I can't think of one openly atheist one of the top of my head, but please correct me if that's wrong.  I will grant that Republicans are 'more' religious or at least talk that way, but the margin isn't all that big.  \n\nI don't deny that Republicans are 'worse' or at least I don't want to argue about that.

This point was later driven home by the Civil War. Which was a pretty big turning point in terms of the States vs the Federal Government. Believe it or not, during Johnson's impeachment hearings, the radical Republicans attempted to restructure the government to be more akin to Westminster.  An act that would have further given more power to the Federal Government. Personally I would say that the States and the Feds are about as equal as they ever have been, and that's important in Federal System, if you want to create stability. But to your point, the founding father's recognized within ten years that a Confederation of states wasn't going to work, and a more centralized government was necessary.

aS'By itself, it doesn\'t necessarily do much, but you have to tie it in with the capital gains tax and the corporate income tax (and other taxes). It\'s extremely complicated, and needs to be simplified, which is one thing the Republicans get right. \n\nBut basically, capital gains taxes are taxes paid on the sale of assets that appreciate in value (stocks, property, business equipment, commercial buildings, etc). There is a difference between short term capital gains (less than one year) and long term, and they are taxed differently. Short term capital gains roughly follow marginal income tax rates (and corporate income tax rates are also similar). In contrast, long term capital gains taxes are lower, to encourage investment in actual property and business assets rather than volatile and risky short term trading on dividends and high risk stock and the like. The problem is that as the marginal income tax rate has dropped, so has the short term capital gains tax, decreasing the advantage in investing in long term, safe assets. The difference is now as little as &lt;15%, meaning if your short term trading leads to more than 15% more profit than a long term investment, you get a higher return, and you get it sooner. Considering the vast amounts of money that flow through Wall Street, that\'s a fairly easy bar to clear a lot of times. And it only gets less advantageous as you continue to drop the marginal tax rate. \n\nNow, to be fair, this is all in theory. In reality, GDP growth has shown a fairly low correlation to capital gains tax rates, but part of this is due to the fact that it tends to move together with income taxes. Since the 70s, Democrats tend to raise them together and Republicans tend to drop them together. The only time there was a consistently large gap in top marginal income tax and top capital gains tax was in the 50s and 60s (where the gap was usually 50-70%, which was a time of pretty consistent growth and fairly infrequent bust). \n\nOf course, there are other ways you could work to fix this. Financial transaction taxes are one way to restrict frequent high risk trading, but it\'s more of a redistribution than an incentive. High top marginal tax rates can also help to limit executive pay (and combined with the accumulated earnings tax can force companies to invest in higher average employee pay or expanded operations). There\'s also the regulations on investing with consumer money and how much risk can be taken with large transactions. There\'s regulation for predatory lending. There\'s trade deals to keep a level playing field for labor. There\'s tighter oversight of the Fed and its ability to bail out failed institutions and control interest rates (the Fed\'s silent bailout of the banks by just printing money and absorbing junk assets makes the Congressional government bailout look like child\'s play). \n\nThere are so many moving parts that it\'s hard to say what exactly is the "right" answer, if such a thing exists. It\'s difficult enough to even know which lever would yield the best results. But regardless of what politicians (in particular, the GOP, though Dems own their fair share of policy missteps) will say, most data points to the fact that overall economic policy since the early 80s is an unsustainable disaster that has only been avoided through sheer force of the Fed\'s intervention and a global willingness to ignore debts and deficits in order to stave off a global sustained depression.

aS'"Nifty" is an understatement.  I thought the graph was totally cool.  I noticed a couple interesting things. From the years 1899 to 1962, Republicans always scored higher in ideology than Democrats.  That\'s a span of 64 years! It flipped from 1964 to 1984.  For the next twenty years, Democrats consistently scored more ideological than Republicans.  From 1985 on, it went back the other way. Republicans are more ideological.  The gist of the graph, however, was to illustrate the gap between Democrats and Republicans.  The current gap is widening and is historically unprecedented. True, it is mostly due to Republicans moving farther to the right.  But, both Democrats and Republicans have been less ideological in the past. I was very curious to know how they *measured* the ideological score. Did you find a link to it?  I don\'t imagine it\'s as straight forward as measuring batting average or ERA.\n\nI know Brookings is measuring *conservative ideology*, but neither conservatism nor liberalism are ideologies.  Libertarianism, Fascism, Communism and other [governmental forms](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81CFMeTqmWL._SY355_.jpg) are ideologies.  They use ideal models and have relatively fixed systems of belief. Conservatism, on the other hand, is no more than opposition to change. It may even look backward (reactionary).  I think of it like a motor-sport competition similar to a tractor pull.  The tractor is liberalism (a force for change) and conservatism is the sled (a weight that holds back change).  The farther the tractor goes, the more weight placed on the sled. The tractor that pulls the most weight the farthest is the winner. Eventually, a tractor stops because it can no longer pull all the weight.  Conservative ideology, like the weight on the sled, builds as liberalism pulls forward. But the tractor does make progress.  A new normal is set, and the competition starts over again. Conservatism is not ideological, it\'s just the dead weight of tradition and history. What do you think?'

aS"I picked up Ayn Rand in tenth grade because the idea of not going with the herd spoke to me.   I put down Ayn Rand's juvenile writings as quickly as I picked them up when I went to an Objectivist Society meeting and realized that they didn't get the same message about social liberalism that I did.  These were essentially socially crippled Young Republicans seeking validation of their misanthropy.\n\nI'm a misanthrope myself... but I'm also a pragmatist and a grown adult.  That is why I'm not a Libertarian.\n\n&gt;There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year olds life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs. - John Rogers"

The Patriot Act and the NDAA are both healthily bi-partisan attacks on the 4th amendment. In case you forgot, it was a D administration that wanted to hang Snowden from the rafters for civil disobedience and loyalty to the People.\n\nRepublicans like Trey Gowdy have completely about-faced from the Patriot Act, while guys like Rand and Ron are feverishly representative of anti-establishment entrenchments. \n\nThis whole "Republicans are all 70 year old WASPs who hate gays, minorities, and freedom," is laughable, if only because laughter keeps the rage from spilling over at its distasteful inaccuracy.

aS"Great quote.\n\nYeah the most troubling thing to me is how Republicans don't realize that the main villain of Atlas Shrugged IS THEMSELVES. It's James Taggart, the capitalist who uses money to try and corrupt the government system for his own benefit.\n\nThat and the fact that Rand was far more critical of religious people than she was of democrats. And why? Because religious people eschew reason. Ayn Rand was chiefly a proponent of reason, her libertarian-like political philosophy was only incidental to her deeper philosophy, that of reason.\n\nTo me it's one of the clearest signs that most republicans don't really study anything at all, nor do they engage in critical thinking. Because had an appreciable number of them actually read and thought critically about the messages in the book then they either would change their philosophical and political opinions, or they would stop endorsing her work.\n\nI personally think that Ayn Rand was a very brilliant intellectual who had a lot of really good points. I think that she missed the boat in a few places though. Really that's how I feel about all libertarians. They are people who are close to the right answers, but just have a few logical flaws in their thinking. Actually, if you want to go real deep, that's how I feel about pretty much ALL philosophers. Everyone approximates truth, I've yet to find anyone who captures it."

There is no way. They have to do something to win at least some Hispanics (Blacks are a lost cause for now).

Sanders is bringing that to the people who have ignored it for so long.  Both Democrats and Republicans have been working for decades to "deprive Americans of jobs" through trade agreements.  They just distract your attention by throwing unrelated red meat that he American public happily consumes.\n\nI will say that I was dissatisfied with Sanders vilifying the Republicans during his AMA.

aS'My favorite scam the Republicans agree upon :  the Earned Income Tax Credit.   Rather than tackle the need for consistent minimum wage increases in the 80\'s, the Republicans signed on to the EITC.   Democrats support it because it does help families and Republicans support it because it puts the burden on the taxpayers...which they could then use as fuel to say "look at how much the government is wasting your taxes" even though they are the ones who championed it the most and  Bush I proudly signed it into law.   IMO, they totally tricked the Dems with that one.  This is not it to say EITC is not effective, just that Republicans voted for it because it does not raise minimum wage.  It works, but the lack of a minimum wage increase at this point is acting as a disincentive for the American workforce. Their paychecks are squeezed by decreases in job opportunities, increases in work loads, commutes as well as increases in housing, education, &amp; healthcare costs.\n\n\nEDIT: KWHITEGOCUBS corrects my prejudice with points the EITC\'d efficacy can actually be superior to the minimum wage, which I will reproduce here: &gt;EITC is more efficient than increasing the minimum wage; even to the degree that the deadweight loss from increasing minimum wage is DRASTICALLY exaggerated by Econ 101 principles (as opposed to empirical data), the EITC is still almost certainly a bit more efficient.'

aS'I will gladly elaborate. First of all, the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is that while the Republicans have NO ONE interested in helping out the middle class and the poor, the Democrats have Barry Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and a few others. Maybe half a dozen in Congress, total. But that still puts them well ahead of the Republicans.\n\nSecond, Obama\'s bailout was a success. Its intended goal was to halt the tailspin the economy was in and to help the economy recover fast. It did that. It also got the banks out of the mess they had created, but that was a side effect. Also, most of the money given in the bailout has been paid back.\n\nWhere Obama failed was in not also helping out all the middle class and poor homeowners who were hurt by the crash. Obama and his Democratic colleagues little or nothing to help out average Americans in that respect. There was a fund set up to help middle class homeowners, but it wasn\'t a big fund in relation to the banks, it was very slow to pay out and didn\'t actually get much done. A halfhearted effort, at best, of which Obama and the Democrats should be deeply ashamed. What\'s more, if the Democrats and/or Obama HAD made a real effort to help middle class homeowners, you can be SURE that the Republicans would have been howling like dogs about the expense of it.\n\nObama\'s deepest failure may have been in the area of justice: his justice department, presumably under his orders, refused to criminally prosecute any individuals for what they had done. They just prosecuted bank buildings and fined them what was for them small change. This was a huge moral failure on Obama\'s part, basically saying "It\'s OK to be a criminal if you\'re a big enough criminal." I was disgusted by it. And I know why it happened: Democrats like Wall Street campaign contributions just as much as Republicans do. In that respect, both parties are identical, with the exception of a handful of Democrats (Sanders, Warren and friends.)'

aS'&gt; real agenda of the "pro-life" movement is.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It certainly isn\'t to save lives because we have double the per capita rate of maternal death of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat\'s a huge assumption, with a really odd "because."  I agree that some pro-lifers are absolute hypocrites that don\'t want to expand maternal care.  But many I have known do.\n\nI think it has more to do with pro life / pro choice being split between republicans and democrats.  "Pro life" Republicans love slashing social programs, so those who are really sincerely pro life are stuck with a party that clashes with their goals whichever way they turn.\n\nThis is why (IMHO) the abortion issue tracks so oddly with the progressive movement as a whole.\n\nA genuinely pro-life movement isn\'t going to be hawkish, and will be against abortion and euthenasia while supporting maternity programs.  That political party does not exist right now.'

The Republicans rewrote history to say they force Clinton when reducing the complexity of  government was part of the Clinton-Gore platform in 1992.  Both Clinton and gore grew up seeing their predecessors not having the kind of dramatic success with their programs they wanted to have.\n\nAnd now the Right acts like they didn't fail at war, deregulation and economic growth when it was obvious all three had fallen apart in 2008.   I think they were terrified their failures were so obvious that they left onto the Tea Party and double down on the admitting nothing money in the waters in the media daily to prevent the sort of intelligent dialogue about what just happened from occurring."

aS'Behind a paywall? No problem\n\nTOPEKA, Kan.  With the state facing a $400 million budget hole for the coming fiscal year, the conservatives who dominate the Legislature here say they are agonizing over the likelihood of doing something that did not seem to be in their DNA: raising taxes.\n\nJust three years ago, many of these lawmakers passed the largest tax cuts in state history, saying they would lead to economic growth. But that growth did not appear, and after repeatedly trimming spending to close shortfalls, legislators again find themselves in a prolonged budget battle with no easy answers, where both houses of the Republican-controlled Legislature are proposing tax increases.\n\nThe reason: even anti-tax Republicans are acknowledging that there is not much more to cut without significantly hurting popular programs, including education.\n\nThe fault lines now seem to run along the question of which taxes to raise. Some believe that income taxes are off limits and that they should raise sales taxes to shoulder the entire burden. Others advocate a mixed approach and said income taxes should be on the table. Democrats argue that increasing sales taxes would be another blow to low-income Kansans to the benefit of the business class.\n\nAnd many worry that the only solution will be to repeal the signature piece of the law they passed in 2012: the elimination of taxes on certain types of small businesses.\n\nI have to talk to myself about it before I reach that step, said Senator Les Donovan, a Republican who is chairman of the Senates tax committee. Im not in favor of raising taxes. Id much rather be able to see growth take care of what we do.\n\nMr. Donovan has proposed removing the exemption on nonwage income for small businesses, instead giving them a 1 percent payroll tax credit. His bill also calls for increasing the sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on everything except food, which would be taxed at 6 percent.\n\nThe tax battle has pit conservative against conservative and produced all sorts of procedural bickering and legislative posturing. As lawmakers have vowed to work through the weekend, the legislative session will reach the 100-day mark on Saturday for just the sixth time in state history. (Sessions are typically limited to 90 days, and each additional day costs around $40,000.)\n\nIn addition to ending taxes on some small businesses, lawmakers passed legislation in 2012 and 2013 phasing in rate reductions on personal income taxes  to 3.9 percent from 6.45 percent on the high end and 2.3 percent from 3.5 percent on the low end  by 2018. The reductions were expected to cost a total of about $7 billion through 2019, according to legislative researchers.\n\nSince those changes, Gov. Sam Brownback and lawmakers have found themselves repeatedly tinkering with the budget to fill hundreds of millions of dollars in shortfalls. The governor has cut some state agency budgets by 4 percent, reduced contributions to the state pension system and shifted money between state accounts. Lawmakers have rolled back funding for poorer school districts and changed the way they allocate money to schools. They have slowed funding increases for entitlement programs.\n\nMr. Donovan said the results of the tax law were never as good as we hoped.\n\nWe hoped they would just be a magic lantern and everybody would react to it, he said. But, eh, its hard to get a company to uproot their business when theyre established and move to another place just because of this difference in tax policy.\n\nStill, supporters of the tax bills are not necessarily willing to concede that the cuts were the reason for the states fiscal problems.\n\nSenator Terry Bruce, the Republican majority leader, said that when the cuts were passed, the Department of Revenue gave estimates of how much the changes would cost that ended up being inaccurate.\n\nWhile initial estimates, for instance, were that the small business tax exemption would affect about 191,000 entities and cost about $160 million, for the 2013 tax year, 333,000 filers took advantage of the exemption at a cost of $206.8 million, according to the Revenue Department.\n\nI dont know if it was a mistake and the intention was wrong or the effect is wrong, Mr. Bruce said of the tax law. It was very aggressive, very quick.\n\nThe House plan would tax the nonwage income on small businesses at 2.7 percent and increase the sales tax to 6.45 percent, but reduce it to 5.9 percent for food.\n\nSome Republicans are holding the conservative line, saying cuts to bureaucracy could close most, if not all, of the gap.\n\nTheres definitely waste in the budget, Senator Dennis Pyle, a Republican, said in an interview. Its my goal to not raise taxes. We have to let the private sector breathe and operate as freely as possible because that is the revenue driver.\n\nBut Democrats called the Republican proposals inadequate for fixing the budget woes. Theres a lot of things you could do to show that you are concerned about all Kansans, said Valdenia Winn, a Democratic representative. But are they doing it? Nope. So your little piecemeal baby steps dont impress me one bit. Theyre desperate because you still have those Tea Party people who cannot go home and say, I had to vote for tax increases. \n\nSome Kansas small-business owners were mixed about whether they needed the tax exemption.\n\nRyan D. Hall, who started his own radiology company in central Kansas last year, said he was not receiving the exemption because all of the money his limited-liability company earned was counted as wages, and the exemption applies only to non-wage income. Yet he said that he hoped to expand his business, and that if he hired employees and bought a building, the exemption could come in handy.\n\nIt would be nice to have down the road, Mr. Hall said of the exemption. They could close the deficit without eliminating this particular provision.\n\nMarena Mitchell, who runs a speech and occupational therapy company in suburban Kansas City, said she appreciated the exemption. Still, she was not even sure how much money the exemption had saved her company, Bringing Therapy Home, since she formed it two years ago. If it was significant, then losing it might increase costs, and she might have to pass those on to the families she treats.\n\nYet as a former speech pathologist for a school district, Ms. Mitchell said she would support giving up the exemption for the right reason.\n\nI would be O.K. getting rid of that exemption if it supported education, she said.'

The Kentucky senator has been saying this for years, but he isnt the only one. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry have also said the department of education is nonessential or worth scrapping completely.\n\n&gt;But what would happen if indeed, there was no Department of Education?\n\n\n&gt;The Department of Educations responsibilities include gathering data to assess how well certain programs and grants are working, awards Pell grants federal financial aid through loans and provides oversight over state policies to prevent discrimination.\n\n&gt;We wouldnt have a federal department to administer Pell Grants to students.\n\n&gt;The Department of Education provided $27.13 billion in grants nationally for the fiscal year of 2015. The department has a budget of $67.1 billion for discretionary appropriations, including discretionary Pell Grant funding. It ranks fifth in the number of awards given by all federal agencies.\n\nJust like Bush.  \n\nOnly worse.

But on average, every agency would get just $2 for every $3 it would have been expected to have next year. That's a massive reduction by any standard, and one for which most budget-conscious Republicans have not had the stomach.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/fact-check-rand-pauls-budget-plan-2015-4 \n\nRand Paul is a Republican education hater at heart. \n"

So it appears that Republicans gained benefits across the board from controlling the redistricting process.\n\n&gt;[Table1](http://i.imgur.com/v8OdT7X.png)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;By contrast, Democrats exceeded their expected seat share only slightly in the three states where they controlled the process.

If it is, quote it.\n\n&gt;How it is interpreted can vary,\n\nContradicting oneself doesn\'t emphasize or deliniate the reasons for the government of a free people.\n\n\n&gt;CU doesn\'t violate anyone\'s right to vote.\n\nClearly it does. \n\n&gt;Everyone has an independent choice over who they want to vote for.\n\nThere are cynical people who claim that there is no choice. And other cynical people who strongly believe that their money influences choice.  \n\nAnd I think the 2nd group are correct which is why I have always respected the decision of the State of New York to not place undue influence on voters.    CU is all about magnifying that influence and nothing in CU is about giving people more choice.\n\n&gt; It may put more power of influence with people with more money, and that isn\'t right, but that\'s an indirect effect of the law, \n\nGiven the power and influence of those who have been able to receive the decision  I can not agree its any thing but the desired, direct effect. \n\nThe indirect effect is additional gerrymandering that has further subverted the "choice" of the people of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Florida, and other places.\n\n\n\n\n\n'

It\'s a giant "Der Republicans are rich and evil and racist and want to ensalve the poor" circle jerk of an epic scale, mean while ignoring the fact that democrats want to fuck us all just as hard. On the plus side there must be a large pro gun liberal movement here... This post hasn\'t been downvoted into a hole in the ground. \n\nEdit: I just realized you were just pointing out my typo. Thanks. Fixing it.'

aS'Rush Limbaugh got caught violating his parole bringing a bottle of someone else\'s Viagra prescription back from the Dominican Republic (Tourism board motto: for when you want to rape a child but don\'t have time to fly to Thailand), but I don\'t suppose you think Ted Cruz is a pedophile because he stopped his fake filibuster from last year to go meet Rush, do you?  \n\nDo you think *every single Republican candidate* is a pedophile because they\'ve all had a photo with their arm around Josh Duggar?  Or maybe you\'re just upset that Denny Hastert\'s blackmail payments after molesting one of his underage students is coming to light.  It\'s weird you\'d even be mad about pedophilia, seeing as how one of your popular candidates just explained that it\'s merely a "mistake" that good people make.  \n\n"The Clinton\'s are pedophiles" is maybe the only accusation scumbag Republicans didn\'t throw out there in the 90s, and now they\'re trotting out another insane smear based on zero evidence out of some mixture of impotence and nostalgia.

aS"&gt;rudderless Bush era of the GOP\n\nOh, there was a direction all right. Normally I'd stop reading here, but a perverse curiosity has the best of me...\n\nEdit: Got to this:\n\n&gt;His most important message for the GOP, for libertarians, and for conservatives: We need to care about the working class, about people who are struggling, and about the poor. Republicans need to listen to these people  even if they occupy the 47 percent Mitt Romney so easily discarded  and talk to them, too.\n\nAnd stopped reading... though the admission that the GOP is anti-American-citizen is refreshing. As Dr. Phil says: you can't change what you don't acknowledge."

aS'&gt;Preventing abuse of power: we\'ve had 230 years of government so that is a lot of experience. And a major abuse of power comes from those three royalists you said you didn\'t want to hear about: Heritage husband, Cheney\'s duck blind guy, and good old "no limit - not true.."\n\n&gt;They know how to abuse power like there\'s no tomorrow. A level below the feds we have the state anti-education/pro-pollution crew like Jindal and Walker and gawd knows what they\'re trying to do to Michigan, Pennsylania plus what they\'ve already done to North Carolina and Florida.\n\nI didn\'t say I don\'t want to hear about them. I said you\'re not making sense when you talk about them. You are trying to use them to represent something, but I\'m not exactly sure what.\n\nWhat particular abuses of power are you talking about? Like, I\'m genuinely asking because I don\'t know. Not voting for top down education legislation isn\'t an abuse of power, it\'s believing that education works better the more locally it is controlled. Similar with the environment, though I\'ll agree that many Republicans are completely ignorant of the facts.\n\n&gt;The main issue? There\'s no free market for health care. This predates the ACA. You can\'t move. You have to deal with networks. Suppose you live in one of our multi-city metro areas like Dallas - Ft. Worth (just a sample).\n\n&gt;Suppose you do move. If you want your existing doctor in Ft. Worth, they might not be able to refer you to a specialist in Dallas. Why? Because they\'re "not in network."\n\n&gt;Ok free market experts. What does that mean? Huh? It means the doctor you go to, despite being less than 50 miles from a specialist can\'t refer you to that specialist. So if you move from Ft. Worth to Dallas you have to make EVERY trip back to Ft. Worth for EVERY specialist for EVERY thing you need.\n\n&gt;Or - you change primary care doctors. Do you want to change doctors? No? Do you want to drive back to Fort Worth for EVERY visit? No.\n\n&gt;You\'re stuck. Why are you stuck?\n\n&gt;It\'s called "restraint of trade" Buffalo Bob.\n\n&gt;So tell me about all the sins of the ACA after you fix the previous ones first. \n\nFirst of all, that\'s completely irrelevant to the matter at hand. I\'m talking about the ability to compel commerce. That\'s a problem whether you have a free market or not. I agree the healthcare market is the farthest thing from free, but it is still a product you purchase. The concern about ACA is that the individual mandate opens the flood gates for other laws compelling purchases. That\'s a valid concern regardless of what other issues the mandate has.\n\nSecond of all, the whole reason you have just significant issues with doctors being "out of network" is because of HMOs and managed care, an institution the Government helped establish.\n\n&gt;True. But not since "WW2." Nixon\'s the one.\n\nYes since WW2. Wage restrictions were placed on companies, so to get around it, they offered healthcare benefits. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States#The_rise_of_employer-sponsored_coverage\n\n&gt;This is all about "managed care." I can see that some libertarians might not like Republicans who created this. I can see that. But there\'s a lot of overlap between Scott Walker and the Koch brothers right now that kind of makes what ever differences there are between the two moot.\n\n&gt;If the Koch brothers were serious about getting rid of managed care, that would be really cool I guess. I can\'t wait. But on their first outing all they wanted to do was get rid of Medicare and that\'s not so cool I don\'t think.\n\nI don\'t see how Scott Walker and the Koch brothers have anything to do with this. I agree there are stupid Republicans and Republicans who masquerade as Libertarians (*cough*GlennBeck*cough*), but that doesn\'t change the platform of more intelligent conservatives and Libertarians.'

p2230
aS'&gt; I didn\'t say I don\'t want to hear about them. I said you\'re not making sense when you talk about them\n\n\nWhat I thought you said was it made on sense at all.  Does some of it make sense, but you simply disagree?\n\n&gt;What particular abuses of power are you talking about? \n\nThe abuse of a power is to attack the power of Congress over corporations power that belongs to Congress in accordance with the Constitution, some of which Congress has exercised over corporations since 1907? \n\n&gt;Like, I\'m genuinely asking because I don\'t know. \n\nThere is an enormous amount of reading to do then.\n\n&gt;I\'ll agree that many Republicans are completely ignorant of the facts.\n\nI doubt that very much.\n\nRe Health care:\n&gt;First of all, that\'s completely irrelevant to the matter at hand. \n\nYou wrote about it.   You wrote about problems with the ACA.  I\'m telling you there are more problems with the framework that a Republican should probably care about even more.  And that need to be dealt with first because it has caused enormous damage to the economy of the United States, and it is a subject that Republicans generally agree on and agree with Libertarians on: free trade.\n\n&gt;True. But not since "WW2." Nixon\'s the one.\nYes since WW2. \n\nHMOs were created by Nixon.  Not by Truman or by "world war 2"\n\n&gt;Wage restrictions were placed on companies\n\n\nBy Nixon.  There were not wage and price restrictions surviving "world war 2."  Nixon did them.\n\n"Nixon\'s the one."\n\n&gt;I don\'t see how Scott Walker and the Koch brothers have anything to do with this.\n\nThe Koch brothers headed the Libertarian party having taken it over from John Anderson and the wine and cheese crowed.  Koch money is making Scott Walker central to the Republican Party.\n\nTherefore they are fatefully linked at this point and have chosen one of the worst disasters in American history: the death of research universities to unite around.\n\n&gt; I agree there are stupid Republicans and Republicans who masquerade as Libertarians (coughGlennBeckcough), but that doesn\'t change the platform of more intelligent conservatives and Libertarians.\n\nTell me how do they exist?  I would gladly favor a Gerald Ford or Colin Powell or John Lindsay.  Where are they in the party?\n\nThe Republican party today has a "Southern" leadership conference.  But hasn\'t the party written off the North East?  And thus we can expect no "Sandy relief."  We were not able to expect George W. Bush to provide relief from the massive offshoring of manufacturing jobs from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania, to Ohio. \n\nMy sense is this started when the Rockefeller wing of the party walked out in 1964 shouting "Julian Bond."  When I posted the problem with rail service between Washington DC and Raleigh North Carolina and mentioned how deteriorating infrastructure causes backups all the way to Boston, what I got from Republicans was that was such a "small area."     They understood about North Carolina.  It was as if the rest didn\'t exist for them.\n\n\nIs there a "Northern" leadership conference?'

aS"&gt;It's not an R vs D argument per-se but more of a corrupt/bought politician vs one that's not.\n\nYes!  Thank you!\n\nThis is really the only point I intended to make in this thread but it seems that the mere suggestion that it isn't *only* Republicans who benefit from large donors is strictly anathema in this sub.\n\nThe blue team vs red team cheerleading is exactly what allows this whole thing to continue."
p2232
aS"I would hold the President to the same standard as congress. Also, Republicans engaging in a witch hunt against the sitting president for things they are as or more guilty of than he is is the height of hypocrisy. Admittedly Clinton should have told the truth when under oath, but he should never have been put in such a situation to begin with. It's not a matter of law if he's an adulterer or not."

aS'&gt; Just last week they had to adjust the date that humans starting using stone tools by 700,000 years despite every expert and every textbook being in agreement right up to the point they were all proved wrong in one fell swoop.\n\nRight, because the date was not based on any underlying constraint, except the date of the oldest stone tools. It wasn\'t like they were suggesting humans were *incapable* of making or using stone tools before that, that was just the time frame in which they were believed to have originated.\n\n&gt;  And then there were the peak oil alarmists who were so dead wrong it\'s kinda funny.\n\nAnd on what basis do you see this being a parallel to climate change?\n\n&gt; Oops, no we don\'t say global warming because we need to keep our options open if the globe isn\'t actually heating up. Call it \'climate change\'.\n\nYou know, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created in 1988, right? And I can find papers at least a decade older than that talking about global climate change. Global warming and climate change are two different, but closely related, topics, which have both been discussed in the scientific literature for decades.\n\nYou know why you started hearing about "climate change" rather than "global warming"? It wasn\'t because of "keeping our options open if the globe isn\'t actually heating up": it\'s because [a Republican strategist wrote a memo suggesting that the Republicans rebrand it because Americans find the term "climate change" less scary than "global warming"](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange).\n\n&gt; Never mind that climates have been changing since the formation of the earth eons ago. \n\nOf course climate has changed in the past. However, the global climate over the entire history of human civilization has been *remarkably* stable, and the current changes driving the climate changes are unprecedented in many millions of years (as are some of the rates of change).\n\n&gt; Where is yours?\n\nSomewhere where facts from the scientific literature can reach it.\n\nHealthy skepticism isn\'t simply denial of anything uncomfortable - it involves looking into the facts and evidence to draw a conclusion. So, where is *your* healthy skepticism?\n\n&gt; Oh and al gore has increased his net worth from $2mm to over $100 mm through investments in green energy. That\'s a clear conflict of interest.\n\nWhy should anyone care what Al Gore says or does? He\'s not an expert on the topic, a scientist, nor is he even a prominent politician these days.\n\nWhy not ignore him, and instead look at what the actual science says?'

p2236
aS"I said it before and I'll say it again. In the last 100 years, the worst possible thing to happen to the United States of America is for the Republicans to control the Presidency, House of Representatives and Senate all at the same time. \n\nThe Republicans achieved this clusterfuck trifecta of doom twice in the last 100 years. \n\nThe first was from 1921-1933 where they caused the Republican Great Depression. \n\nThe second was from 2001-2007 where they would go on to cause The Great Bush Crash, the largest economic crisis since the Republican Great Depression. \n\nSo yeah, Jeb is right to blame the GOP Congress. But his brother is to blame as well. "

aS'Sure. But neither are many people in Vermont who have voted for him. His voting bloc does not consist of socialists only, obviously.

aS'I get it, Congress is suppose to be the "responsible adult" when the President wants something, but the country can\'t afford.

aS"I actually think the honeypot effect goes both ways.   Remember that Romney famously gave Fox *far* more of his time than the other news outlets.   Iirc,  he all but ignored everyone else,  not to mention that he rarely fared well against more critical interviewers.    There was basically no attempt at outreach to non-Republicans,  just nonstop get-out-the-vote pep rallies. \n\n I think some Republicans get themselves into a place where they simply can't go on other outlets beyond the rightwingosphere,  because they've waffled and contradicted themselves so many times that only Fox will let them keep getting away with it. \n\nAt this point,  I'd go so far as to say that *whoever* the Republicans nominate will automatically be unelectable,  if s/he focuses only on Fox.   The numbers just aren't there. "

aS'Right...just what this country needs...another political ignoramus who lies to cover up his family\'s collective fiscal incompetence, lack of leadership skills and integrity.  At the very least, HW Bush (aka the old man) was once smart enough to recognize Reaganomics for the "voodoo economics" it has always been.  That\'s who originally coined the term, "voodoo economics".\n\nSomeone needs to remind Jeb that national budgets have historically originated from the President\'s Office of Management and Budget, at least they did until Congressional Republicans started ignoring that longstanding budgeting process when Barack Obama was elected President.  That\'s precisely how the budgeting process worked when his brother, Dubya, was serving in that role.  \n\nThe [Bush tax cuts, which grew national budget deficits and debt](http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-bush-policies-deficits-2010-6), weren\'t named after Dubya on a lark.  Let\'s also not forget that [it was Dubya and Congressional Republicans who decided to abandon the Congressional PAYGO budgeting rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAYGO), ushering in national deficits and debt in the process.'
p2244
aS"True, but [national budgets have historically originated from the President's Office of Management and Budget](http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-introduction-to-the-federal-budget-process).  Congressional Republicans have been stonewalling and obstructing this longstanding process since Bill Clinton was elected, but it has grown significantly worse after Barack Obama was elected President in 2008.\n\nThis is largely due to Newt Gingrich's malfeasance among other meddlesome Republican politicians and elitists. "

aS'True, Lewinski never claimed that she was pressured into having the affair. However, ethics rules mean Bill should not have pursued the relationship regardless of consent or even if she initiated it. The power imbalance between them was always going to count against him. This standard holds true regardless of political affiliation.\n\nNevertheless, Republicans pulled out all the stops to turn this into an offense they could impeach him over which demonstrated how desperate they were to discredit him. And it backfired, considering that Clinton is the only US President on record to leave office with a higher approval rating than when he started.'
p2251
aS"Because in the 1970s, Paul Weyrich and others following their failure to  get Goldwater and other hard-right Republicans; co-opted social issues as a way to get people into their camp.

aS"&gt;Great idea. We can help make this happen. \n\nWe can? I doubt that. \n\nWhy would those who benefit from the status quo participate? \n\nie, any main steam candidate on either side. \n\n\n&gt;The debate structure is corrupt anyway. \n\nThat's the point. The company who used to administrate the debates, the league of women voters, basically stopped because of how the rules Democrats and Republicans wanted.\n\nInstead, the entity that now runs the debates is now 50/50 owned by Republicans and Democrats and they do whatever they want. \n\nThink about that next time you feel dividend or that Republicans or Democrats are they same. When they're trying to pull a fast one, it's always bipartisan. "

aS"He's tried for most of his presidential career to let Congress do its job, and in the time that he does use executive powers all the Republicans jump down his throat instead of doing their own jobs. So I get why he hasn't done anything, whether or not I agree with it."
p2255
aS"Everyone except McCain and the mining company lost that fight--and lost the bigger war against stupid shit being inserted into critical bills at the last second.\n\nGiven how long ago the bill passed it is clear that the White House *isn't* trying to reverse this provision.  The White House doesn't need a new bill limiting riders, they can just veto anything with riders they don't like. Congress will get the message that if they want something to pass they can't add stuff the president won't sign.\n\nAnd yes, Republicans will try to convince the public that Obama hates America, but they do that anyway. Democrats are usually pretty bad at this, but they won the last fight like this, with the anti-human-trafficking bill that Republicans tried to insert anti-abortion language into."
