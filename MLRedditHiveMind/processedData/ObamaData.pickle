S"I mean I suppose we'll find out. I just have never seen the same level of energy or support behind Sanders that Obama had after he was elected to the Senate.\n\nSanders reminds me more of a Kucinich."
p65
aS"There's no danger of that happening since Barack Obama ran for President and won *twice* on many of Bernie's policy positions.  Obama's mistake was in abandoning those campaign commitments.  Had Obama stuck to his campaign commitments, Democrats would not have lost control of Congress and he would have achieved far more than he did. "

aS'Okay, so confirmed: You don\'t know anything about socialism.\n\nThe "National Socialist German Workers party", aka Nazi\'s, were an anti-socialist movement.  They decided to brand their philosophy as "national socialism", which was basically the opposite of it, but sounded good for the climate of the time.\n\nThey were right-wing and conservative and believed very strongly in property rights.  \n\n&gt; The former Soviet Union, that\'s another great example of socialism.\n\nRight, and the Soviet Union is socialist.  You failed to actually define socialism here.\n\nThe Soviet Union was against property rights, against capitalism, and the government was supposed to give out wages.\n\n\nHillary Clinton and Barack Obama are certainly not any of these.\n\n\nNow, Bernie Sanders is basically in line with modern European Socialist parties, but modern European Socialism (like you have in the UK) is very very *very* different from classic socialism.\n\nObama would be centrist or right wing in Europe.  Right wing groups in Europe push for private healthcare mandates, left wing push for single payer.'
p69
aS'Democrats voting against Hillary for a third party in the presidential election  is the reason republicans control the congress?  Explain that logic please. When President Obama was elected he had 59 democrats or independents that caucus with democrats  in congress. There are now 46, what does this have to do with third party presidential politics?  \n\nThe irony is without third party politics there would be no Hillary at all. She would be as relevant as Eleanor Mondale.  Bill Clinton became president because of the very strong third party candidate taking 19% of the vote in 1992, the great majority from Bush 41.\nVote count was Clinton 44.9 million Bush 39.1 million Perot 19.7 million. Never mind Hillary without a third party we would have never even had a Bill Clinton Presidency. '
p70
aS"How did they change the rules to stop a third party ? With all the current social media outlets and multiple 24 hour news outlets it is easier then ever for the right candidate to reach the public.  President Obama beating Hillary was practically a third party victory. The dems in charge were all ready for the Hillary Coronation and the inexperienced virtual I know charismatic speaker that later became Pres. Obama stopped it in its tracks.  Why can't a third party candidate do the same? "
p71
aS"Of course he does! Perhaps you've noticed Hillary Clinton and her abrupt run to the left, launching her campaign with a very populist message. She needs to keep the same people that elected Barack Obama excited enough to vote for her ticket too. As she already has the centrist democrats locked up, and can only go so far toward the center without losing the idealist base, a Bernie VP pick will let her pivot to the center in the general election without losing the left. \n\nThat said, an avowed socialist on the ticket is just as likely to drag the hypothetical team down as help them. "

All those police actions are nothing next to Obama\'s "tone"\n\nHere are some of the videos and actions that actually inflamed racial tensions:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\n\nhttp://www.newrepublic.com/article/121486/walter-scott-killing-video-sheds-light-police-lying\n\nhttp://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local-4-defenders-violent-traffic-stop-in-inkster-caught-on-tape/31986806\n\nhttp://www.balloon-juice.com/2015/04/25/another-dashcam-video/\n\nhttp://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/eric-harris-shooting-robert-bates\n\nhttp://www.ibtimes.com/john-crawford-shooting-surveillance-video-shows-police-killing-black-man-holding-bb-gun-he-1694695\n\nhttp://www.thestate.com/2014/09/24/3702695_sc-trooper-charged-with-felony.html?sp=/99/132/&amp;rh=1\n\nhttp://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/12/04/1349386/-New-lie-in-the-shooting-death-of-Tamir-Rice-discovered-Police-never-saw-the-tip-of-the-gun-at-all?showAll=yes'

aS"I don't think she would have a shot regardless. She polls well with young liberals but I don't see her getting far in a general election.

aS'&gt; Lets try to return to fact land. I don\'t think there\'s one time where Clinton make a campaign promise and then went back on it once in office.\n\n* [bankruptcy &amp; wall street reform](http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-once-disappointed-elizabeth-warren-on-wall-street-reform-20140905)\n\n* Giving Bush War powers was an abrogation of her sworn duty to have congress be an equal branch of government.\n\n&gt;I\'m not saying you should jump on the Clinton bandwagon, but you really shouldn\'t be spending your time attacking her. That\'s a stupid thing to do in the primary.\n\nThe primary season IS the time to thoroughly vet the candidates. In the last primary one things that convinced me to vote for Obama over all other candidates was his and his campaign\'s ability to answer the "attacks" with clear and well-thought-out  answers and how well they were able to defeat the Rove dirty tricks machine.  Hillary lost the last primary election despite everyone saying she would be the Dem candidate. And when Obama won it excited the base as much as Kerry killed it. \n\nMy fear is that a Hillary campaign would be just like the last Kerry campaign. Same old tired group, running the same old tired positions, falling to the "flip-flopping" attacks from the GOP, failing to excite the ground-troops, bringing every libral-hatin-thumper out of the woodwork to fight for the GOP, and eventually losing to the most unpopular president since Hoover. '
p75
aS"&gt; Also, Obama had VERY LITTLE to do with finding Osama Bin Laden.\n\nBush got enormous support and credit for bringing us back from 9/11 even though he kind of walked into that one.   Bush didn't even go after Osama Bin Laden, according to General Tommy Franks. \n\nTherefore: Obama definitely gets credit for that one."
p76
aS"&gt; Obama had something to do with it, yes.\n\nBush didn't even look."
p77
aS"And that would be galaxies better than a Republican in the White House.\n\nAll or nothing politics is stupid. There is no perfect candidate. You can think Sanders is the best candidate and checks off all your requirements, but he'll never win a general election. And if he's the nominee, or somehow weakens Clinton in the general election then a Republican could win and the country will suffer, that's just a fact.\n\n And if you seriously think Clinton or Obama aren't Democrats then I'm not going to argue with you. You're just wrong.\n\nThat being said, I think Sanders is way too smart to not see the bigger picture here and I don't anticipate it being an issue. "
p78
aS"I find it weird that every modern day president thinks they deserve a library.  Obama wasn't a great president, neither was George W or his dad. If you ask me, since Roosevelt, the only presidents who should have libraries are JFK, Reagan, and maybe Clinton. "

aS'Donors are a good indicator, as /u/fantsmacle said, but he also has some 30 years\' worth of experience to point to as evidence. Obama had to rely on "hope", Bernie can rely on the facts.'

aS"Fair enough. I respect the passion and drive of idealists. I think they have the internal fire to be the best activists. If you want those ideals represented, you're going to have the convince the country over a long period of time. \n\nClearly, in a lot of areas, the country has moved towards the left. I think it is why Republicans are struggling so bad with a weak field. They don't know what they are for. The only thing uniting them is Obama hatred.\n\nAnd I have a chip on my shoulder from all the Clinton hate. The Clintons brought Democrats in from a DECADES long cold. And yet every liberal sees them as those evil triangulating, establishment politicians. It's very frustrating. "
p81
aS'"So what?" So what?!?! That was Clinton\'s stated rationale for the one email account in the first place. She lied. It went against the Obama administration\'s policy as well as the law. Furthermore Obama demanded full transparency on foreign donations with the Clinton Foundation, which she didn\'t do either. Which is probably why one of Obama\'s top advisors, Valerie Jarrett, leaked this in the [first place](http://nypost.com/2015/03/14/obama-adviser-behind-leak-of-hillary-clintons-e-mail-scandal/). I think it\'s funny that unlike Chapelle (who did give an answer as to what it would take to believe R Kelly peed on a girl, do you see the similarities in disbelief/naivety yet?) you still haven\'t answered my repeated question, what would it take for you to lose trust in Hillary as a Presidential candidate.'

aS"Well of course he does.\n\nObama is a Democrat.  Democrats caused the financial crisis.\n\n\nMind you, I don't believe this for a second, but Tea Party folks like Cruz and his supporters absolutely believe this.  The reasoning goes like this...\n\nThe economy was doing just fine until the Democrats took over Congress in January of 2007.  Within just a few months, the whole shebang began to unravel.\n\nWhen you point out that there's literally no way the Democratic controlled Congress could have tanked the economy in less than one year, they'll fall back to their next position:\n\nWhen Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, it was Barney Frank and a few other Democrats who passed legislation that led to the economic crisis.  \n\n\nIf you are so bold to point out that they could only do so with the compliance of the GOP and George W. Bush, they'll fall back on the next position:\n\nThe housing crisis was caused by Jimmy Carter with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\n\nNever mind that there were 12 years of Republicans in the White House afterwards.  No, those Democrats over there are the reason your house isn't worth anything and your retirement accounts suck!  I saw 'em do it!  And that Barack Obama is a Democrat too!\n\n\n\nSeriously, this is the reasoning which allows someone like Cruz to get elected."
p83
aS"If it's such a non-story, why did Obama want Clinton to use two email accounts in the first place? Why did she not? Why did Obama want to the Clinton Foundation to disclose all foreign donations? Why did she not? Finally the real question, does Obama still trust her, or is that why it was one of his top advisors, Valerie Jarrett, who leaked this whole thing in the [first place](http://nypost.com/2015/03/14/obama-adviser-behind-leak-of-hillary-clintons-e-mail-scandal/)?"
p84
aS"Last time people said this it was Nader and we ended up with Bush for 8 years and several wars that we're still entrenched in (which Obama is very much complicit with at this point).\n\nI am voting Sanders in the primary, but I'm voting for whatever lesser evil I can in Nov 2016."
p85
aS"Hopefully you realize just one person doesn't run the country, it was designed that way for a reason. Obama has had to compromise on many issues to get anything at all accomplished. Sanders would have to do exactly the same. "
p86
aS"Come on, all the candidates do it. I'm not trying to say politics isn't corrupt, but the only people not doing what Clinton does are people with no shot of winning. Bernie Sanders isn't going to win a single state come primary time.\n\nAlso, Obama made some pretty big screw ups foreign policy wise but I would vote for him again. He closed Guantanamo Bay, pulled out of Afghanistan, established socialized healthcare, created the stimulus package, ended to Cuba embargo, etc etc."
p87
aS'Great synthesis, people believe that this is an autocracy where the president can singlehandedly steer the entire country, and somehow forget that Obama has had to fight for even moderate positions for 7 years. '

aS"So their slightly different therefor not comparable? Both were unlikely to win, but Obama did. The comparison is that simple. \n\nJust because someone isn't favoured to win doesn't mean they can't. "
p91
aS'I have been all over Bernie for years, no one would have imagined him becoming Senator, and just think about the corporate interest that always fail to topple him.  Hillary is on very weak ground, considering no liberals really like her, and independent find her old news.  This is April 2015, Hillary is disintegrating every day.  and there is no way a Republican can pull this off.  Stop with the negativity, at this point in 2007 Barrack Hussein Obama had the same polling numbers as Sanders!'
p92
aS"Obama has actually achieved a phenomenal amount considering he's been stonewalled the whole way in a manner unseen in decades.\n\nI would vote for him for a third term in a heartbeat if I could. I may not agree with him on everything, but he's done a damn fine job."
p93
aS"Implying that Obama is a DINO?!\n\nHave you seen a list of his accomplishments and positions? He's got a pretty clear left-of-center ideology and history of action in the white house.\n\nWe're not playing a zero sum game where you're either hardlined liberal or else a Republican. Obama championed a lot of important progress for the country even if I don't agree with all of his positions (particularly war issues).\n\nI suspect Hillary would be similar.\n\nIf you think either of them are even half as bad as a conservative president, you're kidding yourself."
p94
aS'"Obama woke up this morning. GOP outraged."'
p95
aS'Eh, Obama had (arguably) less chance at this point in his first run. '
p96
aS"And that's a pretty big deal. Obama was still a very young politician when he started getting the spotlight on him for the presidency. Sanders has a long career, and more than that, he has a consistent career in his voting record. That's pretty damn hard to find."
p97
aS'Doh it finally makes sense. Obama caused global warming '
p98
aS"Yes. Here is the reason. You have money, and you want that money to make a difference. Therefore you donate it to the candidate most likely to win, that way your money is potentially useful. The candidate most likely to win gets the most donations mostly irregardless of their views. This is why Obama raised so much money form Wall Street. Not because he was friendlier to Wall Street than Romney, it's because the people with money didn't want to make a stupid investment in the loser."
p99
aS'No, he calls himself a democratic socialist.\n\nHe only has a warped view of what it means because everyone in the US does. The right thinks Obama is a socialist which is just, fucking, hilarious.'
p100
aS"That's a great idea. Did you know that Hillary Clinton was one of the most liberal senators in our government? 11th most liberal in fact ( Obama was 23rd). And she had a HUGE public record of liberal actions and votes you can easily read about if you google political positions of Hillary Clinton."
p101
aS"I don't even believe that. How could people think that? Fox News thinks center-right Obama is a leftist. How far to the right could they possibly be?"
p102
aS'People thought Obama had a pretty good chance, from what I remember. Obama is a moderate who\'s "too far left" for almost half the country, and Sanders is open about being a democratic socialist.  \n\nThe two candidates that make it to the general election are usually the most bought-out, platitudinous milquetoasts that their parties can offer.  Sanders has beliefs and he stands up for them.   That\'s why I feel like most Democratic voters will pass on him in the primaries. '
p103
aS'Compared to Bush Obama is a genius. If he can avoid any train wrecks in the next 18 months history is going to be very kind to him.  You never know about Bush though. I remember Reagan being a fucking moron but in the last ten years he\'s become some kind of douchey saint.  Conservatives are fond of "opposite world" and can turn any shitbag into some "great man". Ted Cruz celebrated Mcarthy and Jesse Helms publicly in the last few years.  This country has a very dark side.'
p104
aS"Obama touted the Democratic Party platform.  Bernie will be the first one to tell you that he's a socialist. \n\nBernie is not a better choice in the general election.   I'll settle for a disappointing democrat over handing the republicans the general election any day. "
p105
aS"Obama did not come out saying he was a socialist, and was MUCH less left leaning/ idealistic. \n\nThey tried pinning it on him, but didn't have anything to back it up. Not to mention a big part of Obama's first victory was his popularity with the youth. A popularity that I doubt and young person who is not well versed in politics (which is the majority) will have towards Sanders."
p106
aS"&gt; Also, Obama had VERY LITTLE to do with finding Osama Bin Laden\n\nIt's a lot easier to find him if you decide you want to look for him and commit priority and resources to it.\n\nConversely the Bush administration, ironically with false information gained via torture, had incorrectly decided that OBL was basically a figurehead and not an operational leader.  As such they didn't consider him a priority.\n\nIf your point is that Obama had a victory on this one by basically not being Bush and that anyone moderately intelligent would have made the same choices... I can't argue with that.\n\nBut he was moderately intelligent in an area where the previous guy wasn't and that's hard to argue with.\n"
p107
aS"&gt; Obama's mistake was in abandoning those campaign commitments.\n\nHe didn't. He may not have fulfilled all of his promises, but he certainly fulfilled some. \n\n&gt; Had Obama stuck to his campaign commitments, Democrats would not have lost control of Congress and he would have achieved far more than he did.\n\nOhhh. So if Obama had just been further left, people wouldn't have been lazy and stayed home during the midterms? That's funny. Most people who can, you know, do math would tell you, if you're trying to appeal to the center, moving left is going to be less populist and get you less votes. But according to you, Obama just needed to alienate the center and move to the left and somehow that would have magically increased turnout during the midterms? "
p108
aS'&gt;Implying that Obama is a DINO?!\n\nConsidering Obama has said that he is... yeah, dude kind of is.\n\n&gt;President Obama said his economic policies are "so mainstream" he\'d be considered a moderate Republican in the 1980s.\n\nDude literally considers himself to be a Reagan era republican, at least on economics. On other issues he\'s pretty much a pre-war on drugs Republican (which, to be honest, I kind of like).\n\nSource on that quote: http://thehill.com/policy/finance/272957-obama-says-his-economic-policies-so-mainstream-hed-be-seen-as-moderate-republican-in-1980s'
p109
aS"That is 100 percent wrong.\n\nObama was equal to Clinton in fundraising prior to the primaries, and they were each nearly double in raised funds over Edwards, who was the next candidate down in the field. \n\nClinton, Obama, and Edwards were always considered the frontrunners in the primaries, but it was Oprah Winfrey's endorsement and campaigning prior to the primaries that pushed Obama further ahead.\n\nThere is *absolutely* no comparison between the two."
p110
aS'Exactly. Sanders now and 2008-candidate Obama are very similar when you look at their individual positions on basically all issues. The difference is that Sanders has long voting record of doing the things he says he will, and Obama followed through on very little during his presidency. 2008 Obama proved a progressive candidate can win. However, he might have ruined that chance for Sanders because now people think Obama represents actual progressives even though his track record looks more like a moderate republican, and people will just think that will happen again with Sanders if he takes office.'
p111
aS"WTF are you talking about?  Do you look anything up before you post?\n\nIn the first quarter of 2007, exactly where we are now in relation to the 2016 election, **both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had raised $20 million dollars** to John Edwards' $12 million.\n\nHonestly, please don't comment again unless you are at least going to try to be accurate.\n\n"
p112
aS'The people who say he\'s "going" to win and the people who say he "can\'t" win are equally bad. \n\nIs his chance of winning very, very small? Yes. But is it impossible? No. Not to say Bernie is Obama, because he isn\'t, and he lacks many of the electoral advantages Obama came with. But Obama did start at 15% against Hilary. Bernie is hovering around 12%. That\'s high enough that a series of unlikely opinion swings could theoretically give him a shot.\n\nAnd really, if you believe he has literally zero shot at winning I hesitate to say I want you talking up his campaign platform. That attitude shows. People notice, and it hurts the cause. Say he has a 1% chance, because he does. '
p113
aS"&gt;  Obama did start at 15% against Hilary. Bernie is hovering around 12%. That's high enough that a series of unlikely opinion swings could theoretically give him a shot.\n\nNot a lot of argument, but more than your comment.  But, I've seen you all over threads spewing the same message, so I've decided you're not going to change your stance.  Ignore what I said.  Have a nice day!"
p114
aS"I'm not going to change my stance, no, but I'm not sure what that stat is trying to say.\n\nAt this time in the 2007 primary Barack Obama had raised as much money, $20 million, as Hillary Clinton, and they were both nearly double in fundraising over their nearest competitor, John Edwards.\n\nAnyone trying to assert that Bernie Sanders is as much of an underdog as Barack Obama was doesn't have their facts straight at all."
p115
aS'Obama said the same thing. Bernie will get one if he gets to the general election.'
p116
aS"Isn't that pretty much what Obama set up the perception of doing, and it totalled like 15% of contributions? He just lost with this announcement. No need to waste our money. "
p117
aS"Did Obama really claim that he would end the drug wars?  Or did he just say he wouldn't focus on marijuana prosecutions where MJ was legal at the state level? Because he has done the latter. When Bush was in the WH house they were busting up CA dispensaries (IIRC), and Obama put an end to that.  "
p118
aS'Even if he were to beat Hillary for the Democratic nomination he would never beat the Republican candidate.  This country is too conservative for him.  Obama was a moderate conservative and barely won re-election.'

aS'Political guy here. Here\'s a relevant thought from Game of Thrones:\n\n**Stannis:** "*You\'re as stubborn as your father, Bernie. And no less honorable*."\n\n**Bernie Sanders:** "*I can think of no higher praise*."\n\n**Stannis:** "*I didn\'t mean it as praise*."\n\nMoral. Money wins campaigns. Obama raised over a billion in 2012. Romney a little less than that. Bernie will stick to his values. Reddit will love him for that. \n\nBut he needs more than the applause of Reddit to win. He needs political infrastructure in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. That\'s what money gets you. Turnout. And I\'m sorry, there just aren\'t enough grannies writing $5 checks to compete with a Clinton Machine\'s big dollar donors.\n\nHonor got Ned Stark killed. Sanders will share the same fate.\n\n(sorry I know you guys love him and want him to do well. only speaking from experience here)'
p120
aS'It broke my heart that Obama lied to us the way he did.\r\rMore so then Bush. At least you knew where you stood with Bush. Either on one side of a arbitrary line or the other.\r\rObama said one thing and then did the opposite.'
p121
aS'Not really. OP was " The *only real reason* he might be unelectable is because of people saying he\'s unelectable and others assuming that its true. [emphasis added]" If your statement is about the weight or quality of reasons a person "can\'t" be elected, then the whole floor is open. That\'s why I pointed out that the reasons people are saying he\'s unelectable are vastly different than the reasons people were saying Obama is unelectable.\n\nDismissing people who say Sanders is unelectable, without listening to their reasoning, is just as foolish as dismissing him without listening to the other side\'s reasoning. I think he\'s an interesting candidate. I\'m not sure he could win a general election, but I won\'t count him out until we get some debates out of the way. That being said, there are good reasons to be skecptical of his viability, for exactly the reasons that people on Reddit seem to love him. His voting record and outspokenness on "big money," etc. are hurdles he **will** have to overcome.'
p122
aS'Way to completely not address anything I said and dodge it because you have absolutely no reply. \n\nIt\'s true. I\'ve seen it with my own eyes. I have tons of skeptical friends who spout that "voting doesn\'t matter, it won\'t change anything" line...well guess what, if you never fucking vote, do you think anything will change? Of course not! So you might as well at least try...\n\nAs I said, a self-defeatist attitude is literally pointless. In fact, it can only have a negative effect. So please keep your shitty maintaining-the-status-quo opinion away from other people, so that hopefully they won\'t be infected by it.\n\nOn top of that, who actually thought Obama had a chance to win the presidency this same time 8 years ago? Yet he did...\n\nYou\'re not being realistic, you\'re being cynical. There\'s a difference.'
p123
aS"He identifies as a socialist. I personally think it's great, since it's disgusting how right-wing the Democratic party and America as a whole has become (Obama is not a liberal, Obamacare is essentially the Republican healthcare plan from the 90s and Romney's healthcare plan in MA, FFS), but that will turn away a lot of moderates in the general election. He also has a moderately pro-gun-control voting record. \n\nThat being said, despite the socialist thing, moderates might still vote for him since he's clearly not bought and paid like the rest of the candidates are. He was an Independent before this week.  Maybe I'm just being naive and optimistic, but I think Americans are fed up with the two-party system and the corruption rampant in Washington. There were liberals who voted for Ron Paul in the primaries in 2012. I know, because I was one of them. Maybe conservatives and moderates might vote for a socialist given similar circumstances. It's a long shot, but for the sake of America, I hope it works out."
p124
aS'Yes, and it has expanded significantly over the past 8 years and the past 4 years for that matter. Obama was the first one to really harness it and I assume since Sanders is going to run a fairly grassroots campaign that it is going to be a big part of his plan. Think about how many people had smart phones in 2008 in comparison to now.'

p127
aS"The difference here is Obama mentioned the lack of fathers as an example of the lack of opportunity these people grow up in, unlike Paul who blamed the violence on the lack of a father.

aS'Obama is right about the dishonesty behind the repeated "it\'s secret" attacks on TPP.  There\'s nothing about the TPP that\'s more secretive than any other international agreement.\n\nBut it\'s hard to argue about the effectiveness of that "secrecy" attack--you see commenters here and writers elsewhere repeating that line over and over.\n\nHere\'s what Obama said:\n\n&gt; Obama seemed to implicitly reference Warren\'s response on the call on Friday, noting that members of Congress can now view the text of the pact and will have months to review the agreement before voting on the final version.\n&gt; \n&gt; "Every single one of the critics saying this is a secret deal, or send out e-mails to their fundraising base that they\'re working to stop a secret deal, could walk over and see the text of the agreement," Obama said. "When I just keep on hearing people repeating this notion that it\'s secret -- I gotta say, it\'s dishonest. And it\'s a little concerning when I see friends of mine resorting to those sort of tactics."\n\nThe drafts of the agreement are kept secret from the public--just like they are for every international agreement, and for good reason.  The agree-upon sections are available to Congresspeople.  And once the agreement is finalized, the full text will be available to everyone before the Senate votes to either approve it or reject it.\n'

Sitting presidents benefit from naturally good economic conditions just as they lose popularity from poor economic conditions that they had nothing to do with. If you really want to compare presidents look at their policies. Bill Clinton did very little to stay off the growth of Wall Street (he actually helped to deregulate it) and helped give us NAFTA, two things that have been shown to hurt working Americans.

I am extremely glad someone of his caliber has stepped up to challenge and hopefully deter another Clinton. The last thing I wanted to see for this country was another Bush vs. Clinton election. We need to get them, their relatives, cousins and friends all out of D.C. Snakes in the fucking grass, if you ask me.\n\nBut, how do we ensure that Bernie will not get corrupt once elected?

Both of which would be wrong. \n\nFurthermore Obama came in after 8 years of bush II. People were ready for a massive change. Which Obama promised. And won on. But in many ways. Some of which were out of his control he failed. There is and will be a lot of apathy to overcome this time. If anything the momentum will be on the Republican side. Though they do a pretty good job of keeping their voters constantly whipped up over imaginary boogy men.\n\nSanders stands very little chance. Though he has  my vote in the primary for sure.

Completely false statement.\n\nEdit:  In case anyone is wondering, Obama was doing better in the polls than Sanders, versus an opponent that was doing worse in the polls than HRC today, had raised more money, and had earned more public endorsements by fellow Democrats (as far as I know Sanders has none whereas HRC is breaking records).  There is literally no argument that Obama had less of a chance during his first run.  Grassroots groundswell is great, but Obama had that to go with the necessary resources and the backing of establishment Democrats who sway opinion within the party, whereas Bernie Sanders only has the first.  I like Sanders politics better than even candidate Obama's politics (as opposed to the even more moderate POTUS Obama's politics) but making false statement just make his supporters seem loony, a narrative that was used against Ron Paul in 2012 in order to push moderate voters away from him.  If supporters of Sanders want his campaign to be taken seriously, we should admit that it will take an historical run in the primary to win and therefor everyone needs to help him for there to be even a chance.  Not that there is anything wrong with being the Ron Paul of the Democrats given that Paul definitely introduced some Libertarian ideas into the mainstream GOP (even if it tends to be lip service), but if you want to see him win please don't make obviously wrong statements when it just makes neutral viewers become turned off from his campaign."

aS"&gt;Clinton is a horrible candidate who is\n\nShe is nowhere near as bad as the rhetoric and hyperbole that gets thrown around by liberals and progressives in these forums.\n\nShe and Obama are basically the same thing.  Their policy pages could be xeroxed and transposed and you'd never know the difference.  Slow steady progressive and the smarts to know how to get shit done in the face of this kind of intransigence from the GOP.\n\nAnd now, because I like Hillary and dare admit it, I will get downvoted by my fellow progressives who can't bare to put down the right wing smears they've picked up and come to believe. \n\n"

p164
aS'Just to give you some perspective, in the 2012 race Obama raised $230M from small donors (less than $200).  This was a race where he was unchallenged so essentially all small donations went to him vs being split among several candidates.\n\nThat was less than 1/4 of the total raised by his campaign.  Now 4 years the price to run has at least doubled.'

aS'Republicans really cater to the "America #1" attitude.  They have easy talking points that are all coordinated quite amazingly on every media outlet.  The Republican narrative has become the normal.  It\'s "normal" to laugh at liberals and democrats.  Hating Obama is standard water cooler talk.  Americans, I am American, need to stand up for what they believe in.  They only do so during a presidential election.  The republicans have no chance during this election for president.  Now the republicans run on fear and hate.  Fear and hate bring people to the polls.   America is a liberal country , but the liberals don\'t vote.  Scared christian gun loving republicans do. \n\nEdit:  "but the liberals don\'t vote" (in elections that are not presidential)'

p170
aS'&gt; perhaps you should make sure you\'re doing your state level duties\n\nThat is just shifting the conversation though and not addressing the real issue that the President needs the House and Senate to get anything meaningful passed.

Wall street does so many thankless good deeds for our country. On top of that, I really think we're not spending enough on military or wars. We could stand to start at least two more wars in the next 8 years, Obama has really let us down this way and I think Hillary would do better. Also, the NSA are slaving away day after day to *root out terrorism* in the US and abroad and I'm hopeful Hillary would expand this program, for our protection."

aS'Technically not really, you see a pretty clear economic pattern of fuck ups post Clinton and then Obama adopted the shit show that is the Senate locking out any legislation and all of the debt W. put us in.  (Let alone all of those jobs made for Iraq that people depend on that need to be cut.)'

aS"While I don't think it is true, it is not the pants-on-head crazy that you guys are making it out to be. The economy is forward looking, and in October 2008 polls suggested Obama was likely to be president, and his likely future policies could impact the economy before he was even in office. I saw an economic paper that said if the increase in revenue required to fund Obamacare was expected to be raised through taxes on capital, it would explain all of the fall in GDP in the Great Recession and slow recovery. Obviously that didn't happen and was never likely to happen, but the premise isn't ludicrous like the other crazy things Cruz says."
p176
aS'Agreed. I always thought Obama was the lesser of 2 evils. Mind you the lesser of 2 evils is still evil. He always came across to me as a pushy salesman with his campaign of, "I\'m not Bush!" being his pitch.\n\nBernie Sanders putting his hat in the ring actually pushed me to change my voter registration status from Independent to Democrat so I can vote in the primaries.'

The only way we can get change is to get money out if politics which aint gonna happen. "
p180
aS"Obama wasn't a flashy politician. His whole thing was setting policy by impact analysis and a bit of realpolitik instead of ideology. That's an inherently unexciting position, and one likely to burn the base when it gloms on to a dumb policy stance as a litmus test.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, tends to campaign on pledging what the people in front of her wants to hear. I can't even say she's stuck in the twentieth century because even the twentieth century had recording technology."
p181
aS'For the record, I hate NSA\'s secretive and intrusive mass surveillance.  But how can the president possibly "dismantle NSA spying?"  Obama promised he would close Gitmo and he wasn\'t able to do so.  Much as I like Sanders, it just is so irritating to know he\'s making promises he doesn\'t have the power to carry through on.'
p182
aS'So that\'s how he works. "Well, this sounds like something I can use to bash someone, so I will just read it on air."\n\nWonder if he will follow up on it?\n\n"Why, I am never wrong, I just read things as though it were factual from people who are wrong." And the right laps it up "We don\'t need to fact check anything, we believe it! Just like we believe Obama ordered a stand down at Benghazi!"'
p183
aS"Think of it this way:\n\nIn 2008, Obama received donations from something like 3 million people (that's about 1% of the US population).\n\nIf 3 million people each donated an average of $100 over the next year, he'd raise $300 million by around the height of the primaries. If they donated an average of $350 (that's less than $30/month), he'd have raised a billion dollars by then.\n\nI'm not saying it's easy - or even, necessarily, likely. But it's certainly *possible* for everyday people to be able to fund a campaign on that scale."
p184
aS"Right, but what's your point?  Obama isn't running for office.  Bernie Sanders is and they are two totally different people."
p185
aS"Not exactly, McCain did actually have some insight into foreign policy that neither Bush nor Obama achieved. He probably wasn't the right choice for the presidency, but McCain definitely was not the lazy, absent minded simpleton that Bush was."
p186
aS"He'd be 82 at the end of his 2nd term, if he lived that long. I'm not up for age shaming but is it really a good idea to give such a high pressure job to someone of his age? Look at much Obama has aged in the last 7 years. Now imagine that happening to someone who is already really old."
p187
aS'Obama chose not to close Gitmo. It was technically within his power to do, but he opted not to exercise that power, likely because he was convinced by the Joint Chiefs. \n\nThe NSA was created by an NSC directive given through the Secretary of Defense. It is completely under the jurisdiction of the Executive branch, and serves at the pleasure of the President. The president may at any time choose to fire everyone in the NSA.'
p188
aS'No, not really. Many things done in office take place over a several year period. We were still at war when Obama took office. Did he send us to war in the middle east? No.\n\nIf you are going by this logic, then you have to blame republicans for Obamacare if they get elected in 2016.\n\nedit: sp.'
p189
aS"&gt;in response to?\n\nI've heard from multiple people (lunatics) that President Obama is readying the military to institute martial law and remain President forever.  These people were dead serious, to the point of talking about how some patriot needs to assasinate him.  The GOP is shameful for encouraging and humoring those lunatics.  Problem is that it might be the bulk of their supporters at this point."

aS"I am also 34 but a little more realistic. He won't win. Period. I agree with 99% of what he says which tell me he doesn't have a shot. Yea, he'll say stuff that resonates with the public, it'll get enough attention that the big money candidates will parrot what he says. Once one of them get elected, they will give some lip service maybe even try to get some laws passed to shut everyone up for awhile but business will continue as usual. \n\nThere is simply too much money to lose if he gets elected. OP plainly said they were glad Obama won given the alternatives. That tells me that they are very naive.  Bernie Sanders is also the first candidate that has piqued my curiosity but I'm a bit more realistic. "
p193
aS'&gt;Given how things have played out with Wall Street\n\nYou mean with the creation of the Consumer Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, Obama reducing the TARP bailout by about 30% and adding the mechanism by which that money was paid back?\n\n&gt; and the surveillance state,\n\nYou mean the continuation of an existing program approved by Congress?'
p194
aS"There are myriad ways to court the center and the left - as a candidate, Obama did a great job of it. The disappointment with the Obama presidency is that he didn't retain that, and there's no reason to assume that Clinton - already starting off to the right of Obama - would either. The whole premise of the Third Way was to marry conservative economics with liberal social policy, it is an intentional adoption not of centrist policies, but of right policies.\n\n&gt;...and dangerous.\n\nIf it wasn't dangerous, it wouldn't be much of a threat - as long as we don't have financial control over putting our representatives in power, the threat of schism is the only means of control we have.\n\n&gt;The only way to keep the Dems from moving to the right is to be undying supporters\n\nThat requires a level of faith in the essential goodness of our politicians that I find to be wildly unfounded. I live in a single-party city with an 80% Democratic majority, and they keep moving to the right every election cycle."

aS'wow, you have a very strange view of economic history. \n\nno, in fact, the recession started when the Fed, under Carter, raised rates to combat inflation.

It wasn\'t Regan. \n\nAnd the deficit has actually gone DOWN under Obama from where it was at under GWB\'s final budget. \n\nMeanwhile, under Regan, the deficit ballooned.

The "threat" here is far far more damaging to ourselves.\n\nWhat you\'re missing is a clear rational understanding of the power dynamics at play. If we threaten the Dems losing power by breaking off to the far left, they are not going to come after us, they will abandon us and move further to the right as this is the most rational choice for them to maximize their own power. It is an inevitable consequence of the voting system. It is plainly irrational to hold that gun to your head and threaten yourself with it, as the expected behavior is for them to move to the right no matter what you do. Not voting for the Dems has *worse expected outcomes in all cases*. If somehow you feel deep down that if we all just threatened to pull the trigger that they will come around, I would love to play poker with you cause I found myself a sucker.\n'

For example Clinton\'s community re-investment act forced banks to expand lending rules which opened the door for banks to run amok.\n\nHere is the truth about Carter, Volcker and Reagan: http://www.forbes.com/sites/briandomitrovic/2011/02/07/volcker-and-the-reagan-legacy/\n\n&gt;And the deficit has actually gone DOWN under Obama from where it was at under GWB\'s final budget.\nMeanwhile, under Regan, the deficit ballooned. Obama has been far more fiscally "conservative".\n\nDEBT as a % of GDP under Reagan was HALF of what Barry has it at.\n\nAdditionally - funny obama taking credit for reducing spending when he shut down the govt trying to fight sequestration....which actually had an effect on spending and deficits.\n\nYou need to understand the difference between deficit and total debt.  Deficit is for the year, total debt is the accumulation of yearly deficits.\n\nContext matters - Reagan increase spending relative to the size of the economy 50% of GDP \n\nFrom Politifact:\n\n&gt;Obama said since taking office the country has seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds."\n\nHis claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point.\n\nThe claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The countrys spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the countrys biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit.\n\n'

aS"It's not an simply issue of labeling him that makes him unelectable. It's that he's a rather small player against an absurdly strong primary candidate: there's an fivethirtyeight article arguing that Clinton is the strongest non-incumbent primary candidate in recent history, with far more endorsements, earlier, than anyone has had, and far better polling. Suggesting that he's electable *while running any sort of campaign we've seen before* is simply delusional, in the same way that Romney supporters expected him to be electable shortly before the election. \n\nThe only real option is to figure out a way to run a drastically different, more effective campaign that will take everyone by surprise. Obama did something a bit like this, but his techniques won't work again. While I've seen some significant new things from Sanders, like the extensive use of reddit, I don't currently see that the campaign is different enough to make him electable. It's still very early in his campaign, though, so we'll see."
p203

aS"That's the problem with analogies. None are perfect because it is always apples and oranges or it wouldn't be an analogy. I didn't take offense to what they said.\n\nWith that said, I think until we limit money in politics that the president does have limited power. Sure, at a time like now we will see Obama take advantage of the power he has and use it in ways he's always wanted. But in general when so many people in government answer to lobbyists, the money is what talks. \n\nThe president can use their power, and much of what they try to do can be vetoed by the bribed. A system designed for checks and balances doesn't work so well when the players accept bribes. Our government is too tied up in capitalism and big business for the president to have much practical power. "

aS"&gt; Bernie Sanders' track record on civil liberties is impeccable.\n\nIt is.  But you do realize that this is a promise he cannot legally keep right?\n\nCongress creates the laws and provides the budget for them.  Despite nonsensical rightwing claims to the contrary, the executive branch cannot just make or dismiss laws by fiat.  \n\nFor example, Obama has ordered the closing of Guantanamo Bay since coming into office, but Congress won't approve the funding to move the prisoners from there to the US Federal Supermax prison system, let alone the money needed to give them trials, etc.  So, while Obama has wanted to do this since coming into office, Congress has blocked it.\n\nAnd congress can and will do the same thing to Bernie if he ever got the chance...and he knows it. "
p207
aS'It\'s common sense. Do you really think that if a future president Bernie Sanders said: "I\'m going to disband the NSA", that Republicans in Congress, and even a whole host of Democrats, would just roll over and say: "Okay, cool. Go for it.", not to mention the agency itself. \n\nJust look at what happened when Obama tried to close Guantanamo. He couldn\'t even do that.

In 2012 I was a student without much money and I went to Nevada to volunteer for the Obama campaign and after a while I was put in charge of a group of motivated volunteers who went door to door in suburban neighborhoods actually talking to people, giving flyers with information about national and local candidates, and making sure people know where and when they could vote, and arranging transportation for those who needed it. Every night we would get a report of likely Obama voters who hadn't yet voted, and we would go back and knock on their door until their name came off that list.\n\nEvery once in a while we would see the Romney version of this, which was driving a bus down the street and throwing glossy flyers out the bus windows on  to peoples' lawns.

They were the ones who dissented on the Voting Rights Act case. They are the ones who were in the majority for Windsor and will likely be for Obergefell as well.

What in the actual fuck is wrong with these people? They elect these representatives that, in all honesty, are the worst examples of rational human beings this world has ever had the misfortune of sheltering, to represent their beliefs and ideals. How do they think the rest of the world looks at the levels of psychosis our officials excrete on a daily basis? I am very sorry if you are a republican that actually has some sense of decency of morality, but you deserve to be categorized with these fools regardless, because you support their agenda. It has literally gotten to the point where I cannot finish reading an article about Paul Ryan or Steve King without being overcome with physical anger and an urge to vomit. I am not a democrat, and I certainly don't think a lot of the decisions Obama has made are good decisions, but at least that man has a rational head on his shoulders. GOP, if you don't want to go down in history as one of the most disgraceful excuses for a political party in the history of our species, you need to wise the hell up and start treating every citizen of this country equally, and stop trying to push your bullshit, religious, zealous, homophobic, sexist, small minded agenda down everyone's throat.\n"

p249
aS'&gt; For what it\'s worth though, Obama\'s chances seemed pretty slim at this point 8 years ago.\n\nThat\'s a little misleading FYI. [Here\'s the wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) with Primary voting in the run-up to 2008.\n\nThe following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:\n\n* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, \n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%\n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%\n\nNow, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):\n\n* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% \n\n* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   \n\n* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, \n\n* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%\n\nSo, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It\'s hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it\'s an insanely large difference.\n\nSecondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus "not-Hillary" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary\'s level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains "flat" she\'ll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). \n\nAdditionally, the "not Hillary / Bernie" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she\'s included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She\'s [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). \n\nIf I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the \'08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially "Warren Lite". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.\n\nSo where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)\n\n-----------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama "only" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she\'s doing a better job positioning herself as the "populist" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn\'t chip away at her initial polling numbers.\n\n[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]'

aS'I think it stems from a place of ignorance. These individuals likely possess little understanding politics, economics and history. They display a pattern of rejecting science and reason while being compelled by the emotional rhetoric of their charismatic leaders. They often will believe things heard from unreliable and deliberately manipulative sources. The ability to critically analyze events and policies and connect them to their consequences is seemingly absent. Most are very religious and are more concerned with the social issues rather than the fiscal or diplomatic ones. For these people, voting for a politician who shares (so they claim) their values is more important than voting for one that will actually protect their interest. People also tend to attribute good character to those individuals who more closely share their beliefs. Another reason is that people like simple heuristics: "I\'m a Republican, that means I vote for a Republican. Obama is bad, everything he does is bad.". Then there are the cultural aspects. They most likely share the same political affiliation as their parents. There\'s pressure from society to either vote and think a certain way or face rejection and judgement from peers. The politicians are also very cunning. They pass policies that ensure they get reelected such as voter ID laws that prevent specific demographics from casting their vote. These demographics, not surprisingly, tend to vote more liberally. And here\'s where I get speculative. I think a lot of these political leaders and their powerful supporters want to keep the majority of the population poor and stupid. Poor so they don\'t have the resources to fight back and stupid so that they don\'t realize that they should. The poor and stupid are easy to manipulate, they are mindless consumers, and are easier to ship off to fight wars. I don\'t think it\'s some remarkable coincidence that public schools are so underfunded, that higher education is so expensive, that abortion and contraception is so vilified, and that the income inequality is so extreme. While this is all incredible depressing and disheartening, I take solace in the fact that more and more people are starting to become informed and are questioning the status quo. '

aS'30 year old checking in (fine ... 31 in a few days)\n\nI remember watching Bernie talk over the last few years and thinking "It\'s too bad we could never have a POTUS like this."\n\nThen when I heard he might run I though "Oh good.  He\'ll keep Hillary honest in the debates." thinking he wouldn\'t be a serious candidate because he can be downright "weird" at times.\n\nSeeing how many people threw their support behind him in a few days is really making me think he might have a shot.

aS'I think you\'re looking at it the wrong way.\n\nIf he were elected, he would have a massive mandate. *Despite* massive money arrayed against him, the people actually chose him.  Despite years of red-baiting propaganda, people became so sick of the cheating that modern capitalism represents, they chose a Socialist.  Such a tactic would embolden Democrats that there is another way. \n\nAs President, Sanders would essentially be the head of the Democratic party, and be able to support progressives over conserva-dems in elections (the opposite of what Obama has done the past several years).\n\nAs President, he\'d have the bully pulpit to drive the conversation around issues that matter and speak plainly about the origins of our problems.  Conservadems like Obama took the energy of the left and turned it into disgust and cynicism.  \n\nBut Hillary is willing to lie for the duration of the primaries, much like Obama did, and Wall Street has her back because they know she\'s lying, and we\'ll all accept that because --- apparently, she\'s "electable". \n\nAnd thus does American politics continuously slide ever further rightward.'

They tear each other to pieces.\n\n2008 is a perfect example.\n\nHilary, Edwards, and a few others tore each other to shreds.

Crimea, a land where people wanted to be part of Russia but we\'re bullheading them. Iran? Yeah, Obama is all about nuking them, but allows for the possibility he won\'t if they don\'t get a nuclear deterrent, because if they can nuke us, we can\'t get all their oil and our sanctions matter less. NSA? Yeah, he\'s with them.\n\nSo yeah, the democrats seem so much more real, except maybe Hillary but at least she\'s a strong woman with a backbone and experience. Obama has an actual world view where he traveled the nation and has outsider perspective. Not like Palin or the crack head pizza shop owner shouting nein nein nein!

p283
aS"That's a great thing to keep in mind, but it's also important to remember that if Sanders was elected President, he would still have to contend with business-as-usual politicians. One of the main problems with politics is the way politics is played. The system itself is broken, and for someone to rise to national level politics, they must become part of that system. We get anomalies like Sanders once in a while, but the rest of the politicians will stay the same, as will the broken system. As long as that system remains in place as is, politics will remain corrupt.\n\nMany people on Reddit might be too young to remember what it was like when President Obama ran his first time. Everyone got swept up in the hype (understandably), but few remembered what happens when politicians reach the top. They necessarily must sell their ideas to manage the whole country. I like the idea of Sanders (as I liked the idea of Obama), but mark my words: President Sanders would be very different than candidate Sanders. Nothing will change.\n\nAs always, I greatly hope to be proven wrong. I want nothing less than for the system to become better. Maybe a good President Sanders could start that change. Maybe. But historical evidence all too often proves the opposite. Pessimism and skepticism is necessary to remain vigilant. Please, everyone, don't get swept up in the emotion and the hype. Make them prove their worth."

Education of the populus is the first step towards changing the system. I like him, but I hope he doesn't get elected. We nee people like him and Warren in the trenches. A President Sanders will be ineffective for change. Then again, so will anyone else who gets elected in the current system.\n\nWho will be the people who will cause a peaceful ruckus? Perhaps his supporters, sure. But nothing will change without MASS demand for it, and most people involved in politics get too wrapped up in partisanship. They don't see the woods for the trees. It's just how people are. How does Sanders plan to change that? What is his plan to change the rhetoric, the media, those stuck in the mire of the in-group/out-group mentality of the right AND the left? To effect real change, the whole thing needs to change, including the attitudes of the people. Throwing support behind candidates is useless if the way business is done hasn't changed.\n\nI really hate my pessimism when elections come around. But, politics doesn't change. The people need to rise up to change the system. Sanders might be a good teacher, but he will not be the instrument of change. Obama is a great example of why that sort of figurehead can't change the system. There are too many people who won't go along with it. I love hope, and I'm a politically active person, but I know in my heart that the system iteself is broken, and it cannot be changed from within."

aS'I actually remember Jon Stewart commenting, I think early in Obama\'s first term, that it was *very* hard to satirize Obama.  His demeanor and the way he presents himself doesn\'t offer many opportunities for comedians to "riff" on him.  There\'s just very little about him that\'s funny in a make-fun-of-him kind of way.\n\nHell, arguably the best Obama satire was the SNL skit with "The Rock" Obama, the slightly angrier and more aggressive version of Obama.  Because even The Rock Obama is moderate, well-spoken, and level-headed.  \n\nComedians are only as good as the material they have to work with, after all.'

aS'&gt; She hasn\'t said she would. In fact she has been saying she will implement very liberal policies.\n\nShe\'s a politician. Her job description is practically "professional liar." Keep in mind, even Barack Obama lied his ass off ("most transparent administration in history, " he "opposes free trade agreements like NAFTA" etc) to get his ass elected. \n\n&gt; Her record does not show a history of implementing Republican policies. In fact she was one of the most liberal members of our Senate.\n\nSo the Democratic propaganda machine claims. Her past history shows deep, close ties to Wall Street/finance interests, as does info about who her campaigns financial backers are. Her husband was of course one of the biggest Wall Street whores we ever had occupy the WH up to that point, as well as a neoliberal and an imperialist. Hillary too is known to be extremely hawkish for a Democrat, practically in Joe Lieberman territory. Another strong indication she\'s a neoliberal Wall St agent as well. \n\nSo I wouldn\'t take dailykos seriously from now on. And whoever rated Hillary 11th most liberal. Well, I suppose it\'s possible it\'s true, but then that means the Dem party is so far RW it\'s practically a fascist party at this point, and all people of conscience should be boycotting it.'

aS'&gt; But he already won his election!\n\nOne senator (much less one Congressman) can\'t actually govern.  It takes a majority.  Kind of like how Obama winning the presidency (individually a lot more powerful than any legislator) hasn\'t by itself made it possible to pass legislation.\n\nWhat\'s important to remember is that the thought process isn\'t "this is what I believe, and I\'ll do my best to accomplish it."  The thought process is "this is what I believe, because it is unequivocally correct, and anyone who opposes that is either stupid, misinformed, or actively against doing what is good for America."\n\nOne need look only the comments in this very thread to see that mindset at play.  Why do people vote Republican?  Not because they might have legitimate disagreements with the Democratic party, it\'s because they\'re misinformed by talk radio and Fox News.'

So, I guess nothing is out of the realm of possibility."

aS'Thanks for such a fantastic response!  I think it should also be considered that Clinton in this cycle is benefitting from the investments she made in that first campaign. Both in name recognition, and the in presumption of inevitability. \n\nI\'d read this as a candidate with an unprecedented "pre-campaign" (Clinton) affecting the polling by people trying to pick the winner when they\'re asked who they support. \n\nThere was an analogue in the \'08 campaigns that I\'m using to temper the early polling. When the black community was polled pre-Iowa Obama did poorly, then afterward dominated that demo. People need to believe their candidate can win before they\'ll voice support. \n\nSanders needs a proof of viability moment. '

He supposedly has a great handle on the issues and is different from all the other politicians.\n\nBut my point is, he's not. He's no different, he simply knows the only way he will have a chance at getting elected is by acting like he's different. Reddit does this all the time and it's just despicable. Obama was supposed to be America's lord and savior. I don't know if you were around for that but he was praised and drooled over just as much as Bernie.\n\nThey're all the same, and I'm not getting tricked again even though it seems like everyone else here will be."

Barack Obama goes down as the president who vetoed the most bills and in the succeeding election cost his party another election.\n\nThe president with the most vetoes is FDR with [635](http://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm).  How many does Obama currently have? 4.  Obama could literally veto a bill every single day from now until he leaves office and he *still* wouldn't be the president with the most vetoes."
p301
aS'So Obama says that the legislation his administration passes is absolutely necessary for the existence of the US? Every president would say that his policies are the only way for the US to keep existing. That\'s why you shouldn\'t use only politicians as source for the importance of a policy. (Yes this counts for every politician including Elizabeth Warren)\n\nThe real questions remain: Is unleashing the cooperations and financial institutes the right thing for the whole economy? The "Deutsche Bank" did already implicate it will sue the US for these "unnecessary burdens" it has to fulfill to be allowed to operate in the US after the crisis (Because the German government didn\'t had the courage to regulate them stricter after giving them billions of Euros.)\n\nAnd why is this not be negotiated in the WTO? Also do you believe that the big concerns who are co-writing (sorry counsel) this bill have the best interest for the whole US and European economy (including small businesses) in mind or will only try to strengthen their position?\n\nIn my oppinion this bill is far to shady and "big buisness" to be good for the whole economy but of course this is hard to prove if it\'s made in secret negotiations.\n\n'

The results of the vote ratings show that Kerry was the most liberal senator in 2003, with a composite liberal score of 96.5. But Edwards wasn't far behind: He had a 2003 composite liberal score of 94.5, making him the fourth-most-liberal senator.\n\n\n\n&gt;[January 31st, 2008](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/31/study-obama-most-liberal-senator-last-year/) \n\n&gt;Barack Obama has demonstrated his appeal to independent voters and even some Republicans as he campaigns for president, though a just-released study from the National Journal indicates the Illinois Democrat was the most liberal senator in 2007.

Bernie is 73 I believe, ridiculously far left and still refers to himself as a socialist (very bad in American politics). I'd also say the public was much less enthusiastic about the aspect of a Clinton presidency then, than they are now. 16 years after Bill as opposed to 8. "
p313
aS'&gt; Obama raised $410 million to beat Hillary in their primary. We can match that. \n\nCan you match the political machine, though?\n\nThe money is important for buying advertising and such, but Obama had more than money.  He had people.  People not just organizing at the "grass roots" level, but a large network of volunteers to get out the vote and get him the necessary number of delegates to win the nomination.\n\nMoney is a nice thing to have in politics, but it means nothing if you can\'t win enough delegates to the Democratic convention.  \n\nFor that, you need voters.  Not just any voters, but primary voters.  These are folks who are often already involved in politics at the local level.  People who have volunteered to be delegates.  People who serve in the local party apparatus.  People who show up to town halls, work for campaigns, and canvass neighborhoods.\n\n\nAssuming you could convince 3 million Redditors to donate in the numbers you\'re talking about, it means absolutely nothing if those people consider their donation to be a job well done, and stay firmly planted in front of their computer.\n\nNo, you gotta get involved in the "ground game."\n\n\nFYI...that network of supporters that Obama had in 2008 and 2012?

p319
aS"&gt; I have to call b/s on that camp being for Hillary.\n\nBased upon what?\n\n\nThe reality is that the former Obama campaign organization has been more or less handed over to Clinton.  The email lists.  The database of supporters.  The donors.  The Super PAC organizations.  Her reward for serving dutifully as Secretary of State is that she gets the very formidable Obama political machine to join with the Clinton political machine, and if you seriously think enough of those people are going to defect and join Sanders' campaign then my guess is you live in one of the states where recreational weed is legal and you've been smoking some really good stuff."
p320
aS'&gt;  everyone in the media and the pundits and everyone who keeps your mind set of thinking the people who would vote for the old way thought obama would be a complete failure.\n\nThat\'s not true at all. Obama actually received a [fairly significant level of establishment support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Endorsements). By this time in 2007, [he was polling](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html) within 10 points of Clinton. Along with Edwards, and Clinton, Obama was treated as a top rate candidate, though Clinton had been considered the presumptive nominee from the start. And on that note, [Clinton\'s position in 2016 outpaces her position in 2008](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-iowa-2016/); the "inevitability" of her in 2008 is not at all comparable to the same claim for 2016. (Not that the last bit is particularly relevant, but but it could be later in the discussion and I wanted to pre-note that.)\n\n&gt; lastly i dont think rubio has a chance at all. the republican\'s have long since been using the southern strategy and they\'ve attracted a base that is a fairly racist. they\'re not going to vote a latino, even if he\'s from their party, to presidency.\n\nI think this is a misapplication of assessments. Republicans have shown they\'re more than willing to elect minorities that follow the party-line on issues. Bobby Jindal, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Brian Sandoval, Susana Martinez, Mia Love, Will Hurd, Allen West, Ral Labrador...\n\nAnd that\'s not touching on the big unelected republicans that get lots of support, like Ben Carson, Collin Powell, or Condoleezza Rice. Or hell, look at Romney -- he didn\'t lose any noteworthy support with evangelical voters despite being a Mormon.\n\nRepublicans will happily support people of whatever background -- just as long as they\'re "right" (to the republican voter) on the issues. Racism today is systemic and passive, rather than individual and active: where the republican party is racist is via their policy stances and as a magnifier of already existing dislike -- not through large-scale inherent outright rejection of someone for their race or ethnicity.\n\nOn the flipside, I\'m not going to argue that Rubio is going to *gain* any significant hispanic support just because he himself is hispanic. He\'ll be opposed by the majority of them for the same reason the majority of republicans would support him: his policy stances.\n\n&gt; as for rubio\'s charisma i\'m not so sure. he has the same charisma as romney, he\'s robotic.\n\nSorry but I can\'t agree with that at all. Watch Rubio in an interview or speaking. I don\'t agree with him or even like him, but he\'s clearly a politician that knows how to speak well for himself. Romney had no ability to relate to people or even pretend he could relate to people: almost every time he spoke he reinforced some negative perception of him. Rubio doesn\'t suffer from that. [Charismatic is perhaps the single most often used adjective to describe Rubio](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/young-marco-rubio-stuns-media-with-his-charisma.html) -- and it\'s not by accident.\n\nFor my $0.02, as a progressive: Rubio is likely the most dangerous republican in the race right now. He has a path to the nomination, and would be able to make a politically valuable contrast with any plausible democratic nominees. He\'s not really significantly less conservative than Cruz or Paul, but he\'s able to *talk* like he is -- and convince people that he is, too. A dangerous skill.'

aS"It seems that not too many people know the story behind the Ron Paul campaign in 2012. The combined forces of the GOP and the Liberals in both government and media relentlessly attacked and belittled Ron Paul through his entire run for the Presidency. Over and over and over they called him unelectable even as he won more and more states. When it came time for the Republican convention where a nominee would be named there were TWO candidates on the ballot, Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. Shockingly both sides of the media had weeks earlier already named Romney the OFFICIAL Republican nominee before the primaries were even over. President Obama played the game as well, going so far as to Congratulate Romney. The day of the convention Romney's camp was terrified that among his delegates were those who were not legally bound to vote for Romney and fully intended to vote for Ron Paul. The GOP quickly remedied this by raising the number of states required to be on the ballot from 7 to 9 ON THE VERY DAY OF THE CONVENTION. Not one word of any of this was ever mentioned by any of the corporate media. A very good display of media manipulation and cooperation by the allegedly very different parties.    \nEdit: My point being of course that the media will always obey their masters even if it means lying to your face and keeping the truth from you at all costs."

p324
aS"You're right Ron Paul would not have completely lopped off our foreign policy, just almost completely. More than likely he would have refused to engage in any conflicts or support any conflicts. This makes his negotiating position with say Iran very weak. But more importantly, it would have pissed off our numerous allies.\n\nForeign policy is a very delicate balancing act. Obama has done a great job of not telling our allies to fuck off, but also resisting calls to put more Americans in danger. Sanders would continue Obama's foreign policy, which is a major strength to his platform. "
p325
aS"Thats true. Obama is also a far better speaker and debater. Obama also was made into the Progressive icon by most of the left in contrast to Clinton (even though he really wasn't)\n\n If anything, I'd compare Sanders to Dennis Kucinich.  But since there is not another candidate like Obama to steal Clinton's spotlight, I think Sanders will fare better than Kucinich."

Why do you think so?  In the beginning, Obama was considered by most as a long-shot.  He had to run against not only Hillary, but her former president husband also campaigning on her behalf.

aS'That\'s a completely false dichotomy.  There isn\'t a choice between only covering the frontrunner and establishment candidates versus covering EVERYONE.  There\'s many reasonable degrees in-between.    \n  \nAnd asking for similar media coverage for both current candidates doesn\'t mean glowing/positive coverage.  It should be honest and adversarial.  Obama was trailing Hillary by over 30 points in 2007, by your explanation, he should have received much less attention.  Yet the media was in the tank for him and helped push him to the nomination.  It\'s worth noting that the nomination process isn\'t a truly democratic function, with the arcane awarding of delegates, caucuses and superdelegates.  Obama received less votes than Hillary in 2008 so purely focusing on polling doesn\'t tell the whole story.    \n  \nIt\'s not the media\'s job to be gatekeepers and reduce the campaign to their decided candidates.  If the story is the Democratic nomination, they should cover the declared democratic candidates.  It is reasonable to have a cutoff of how many candidates to cover, for example the candidates polling at least 5%.  There are only two official candidates, so the relevant polling should only have a choice of those two candidates, of which Bernie has a significant draw.  Nationwide, it\'s not unreasonable to only cover the party nominees who have received enough signatures to be placed on the ballot in enough states to have have a mathematical chance of winning the electoral college.  That would limit coverage and debates to just 4 national parties.   Also, I did not even say unequivocally that any and all candidates should be given equal attention, just that in ONE race with just TWO candidates.  \n  \nIf you think Hillary is such an overwhelming favorite, then they should not even cover the nomination process at all.   If it\'s such a sure shot and it\'s 9 months from the first caucus/primary and 18 months from the national election, don\'t even bother covering it.    \n  \nThe establishment media lies to their audience through narrowly defining the acceptable spectrum of debate and ignoring the views they declare "extreme" that a significant percentage or even a majority of Americans identify with.  It\'s piss poor journalism that makes races covered by bullshit factors like who\'s "electable", who\'s too old, who\'s likable, who had less gaffes and who "energizes their base."   \n  \nFair and honest media would instead shape their focus by using a very simple questioning string: What are the top issues for voters, what are each candidate\'s specific position and record on each issue, where is there a difference, then highlight/debate those differences and hold the candidates to account when they violate their pledges.    \n   \n**TL:DR**  Election coverage is absolute garbage. There is no justification for the silent treatment Bernie is receiving.'

If you still think he is a liberal or progressive who just couldn't overcome the republicans in the house/senate you're delusional.

aS'The War Powers Resolution doesn\'t remove Congress\' responsibility to declare war. It only says the President has 48 hours to get Congressional approval and if no formal declaration is given then all related military activity must cease in 60 days. Obama ignored both the Congressional permission part and the 60 day limit part of the War Powers Resolution. If you were paying attention he also tried to convince everyone that he didn\'t break the law because it wasn\'t war it was only a "Kinetic Military Action". I clearly stated in my comment that the Republicans were just as bad. My point is that the Democrats praise Obama for being anti-war and a lover of the Constitution when he is neither. \n\n&gt;How\'s that ground war in Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Iran going?\n\nYou lost me.

Joe Lieberman was the last senator they needed to end filibuster and [he wouldn\'t vote to end without the government options being removed](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28788.html).\n\nI understand everyone wants to get hyped when Bernie Sanders talks about a single payer system but people need to realize politics is way way way more bureaucratic and complex than one person saying "let\'s do this". After all, back in 2007 Obama was the one saying "let\'s do this".'

Respect from a connected generation that jumped in to fight the Rovian dirty tricks. Unless you can energize your base you can\'t do that. Kerry didn\'t and he lost to the most unpopular president since Hoover. Just like Hillary he was "the most electable candidate" according to the MSM. \n\nUnless the DEMs get someone who can fire up the base it will be another election like Kerry vs Bush where Kerry ( with the same supporters as Hillary, same upper crust donors as Hillary, same inability to debate like Hillary) got crushed by Bush. \n'

I mean no offense, but even people in college and with degrees are dipshits after this whole "No Child Left Behind" "teaching to pass tests" bullshit.  Honestly a young lady I know, Junior in college, didn\'t know what Napalm was, when I made a reference to her killing the shit out of my grass.  That\'s just one example out of many.\n\nPeople are just simply too stupid to know, look out for, or VOTE in their best interests.  I came from a family highly interested and involved in politics, but most of the adults I know, don\'t vote.  They don\'t vote for either party when really they can\'t afford not to!  I\'m voting so they don\'t get their food stamps cut off and their kids will starve.  WTF?  \n\nIt\'s a culture of apathy.  We all know there are major problems but we do nothing to correct the problem... it\'s like "oh well, someone else\'s problem, until it directly involves your life.  Even then people are pissed for a minute and then go back to their business. \n\nPropaganda rules.  I don\'t fall victim to it because all my life I have questioned EVERYTHING and EVERYONE.   I knew that in 2000 Gore won the election.  I knew in 2001 that Iraq did not have Weapons of Mass Destruction.   Just because they say it on the boob-tube (television) does not make it so.  Just because a politician is telling it to you, does not make it so. \n\nMoney and big business rule.  As was alluded to in the response to your comment.   Big business LOVES Hillary.  She\'s almost like having a Republican except for on a few Social issues that keep the rabble at odds with each other.  Hillary running against any Republican is a win/win for big business. Sort of like Obama, or Mr. Goldman Sachs as I like to call him.   All these political should be forced to wear their sponsors logos on them like NASCAR drivers.  That way we can see who they are really representing. \n\nWhat can you do?  Vote for Bernie Sanders.  He might not win the Primary, but I hope he does. If he doesn\'t, still don\'t vote for Hillary.  Whip the DNC in to line like the Tea Party whipped the GOP. Let them know that you won\'t vote for any Corporate owned asshat that they throw up there.  Vote for the Candidate that most represents your views.  In my case that would be the Green Party-- but who ever\n\nWill the DNC lose?  Maybe, maybe not-- but don\'t give them your vote just because "the lessor of two evils" excuse.  Make no mistake the lessor evil is still EVIL.... that\'s how corporations have been holding us.  With fear.  You have to figure, the worst President on the planet is only going to be around for at MOST 8 years.  Hopefully 4 if a good, honest, for the people option is given.  Ride it out.  \n\nFinally there was a theory in old Social Work teachings that Welfare was a bad thing because it gave people just enough to scrape by on that they did not rise up for equality.  I believe that to be true.  Poor people don\'t vote, but I bet starving people would vote.   Sad to think that\'s what it will probably take to get a lot of people to the polls, but if that\'s what they need, I am personally prepared to give it to them. '

aS'Obama had basically the entire black vote and progressives who saw voting him in as a huge thing. People were blinded by this really cool possibility of a black president and didn\'t really pay attention to his policies. The same thing will probably happen with a woman, if not in this election then the next one or the one after that. Their campaign promises don\'t really matter, it\'s just "Hey, I could be part of electing the first female president. How cool is that? And maybe she\'ll be able to change something." People just want to be different, and not vote for some old boring white guy every four years.'

aS"&gt; And asking for similar media coverage for both current candidates doesn't mean glowing/positive coverage. It should be honest and adversarial.\n\nRight. Part of that honesty means saying that a socialist from vermont is probably not going to win the democratic primary. \n\n&gt; Obama was trailing Hillary by over 30 points in 2007, by your explanation, he should have received much less attention. Yet the media was in the tank for him and helped push him to the nomination. It's worth noting that the nomination process isn't a truly democratic function, with the arcane awarding of delegates, caucuses and superdelegates. Obama received less votes than Hillary in 2008 so purely focusing on polling doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nThe malpractice there was the press following Hillary after she basically lost because they wanted to keep the horse race up, not whatever press happened before Iowa. As you note, the primaries aren't like the general election, and the Obama campaign took *full* advantage of this. By the end of February they had the nomination locked up but the press didn't want to admit it because it served them to cover the horse race. \n\n&gt; There is no justification for the silent treatment Bernie is receiving.\n\n[What](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=bernie+sanders+site:nytimes.com&amp;tbas=0&amp;tbs=qdr:w).

aS'Serious question, and I would appreciate answers rather than just downvoting the wet blanket to oblivion.\n\nI\'m guessing that a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters don\'t remember what Obama ran on the first time. It was "Hope and Change" -- he was saying many of the same things as Bernie Sanders. He wanted to fundamentally change how government worked. He wasn\'t as populist as Sanders, but there much of the same starry-eyed dreaming that Obama "cared about the poor and middle class" and "we would finally have someone who got it." I still remember reading some young voter who was filled with pride that she voted for Obama and she felt invested in fixing the future!\n\nWell, Obama got a few things done, but does anyone *really* think he delivered on his promise of "Hope and Change"? Now, most people will scream at this point, "REPUBLICANS BLOCKED HIM!!"\n\nI think what many people don\'t realize is how dirty a game politics really is. It isn\'t new. People have been dead-set against a lot of big programs that got passed, but Presidents have got them passed because *they weren\'t afraid to get dirty*. They threatened, they cajoled, they bartered, and they GOT THINGS DONE. The left HATED Reagan, yet he got things done. To be an effective President, you have to be willing to do what\'s necessary.\n\nWhen has Bernie Sanders ever demonstrated that kind of leadership? He talks a lot, but when has he ever, through sheer force of personality, gotten something done? Obama did a LOT of talking, but a President has to be a tough SOB otherwise they\'re roadkill.\n\nDo you want someone who says what you want to hear, or do you want someone who can *get things done*? Why in the world do you think Sanders can get anything done?'

p361
aS'God dammit Republicans. You had ONE job to do and oppose whatever Obama wanted. '

aS'I remember all that, and to this day the way to get downvoted is to be harsh regarding Obama. He has a similar cult of personality that GWB did and "circle the wagons" faithful.\n\nNo, I don\'t do fanboy, but I understand why. He\'s a Democrat and Democrats back Democrats. Lest someone say, but but but, yes Republicans do the same thing. One would have thought that they would have had a fit when Iraq turned out to be a sham, but no they "downvoted" the opposition. But the point is that a powerful machine and loyalists enable parties to do just that. Bush and Obama have come up through a system where they owe the Party. With Bernie he may not deliver, but he has a track record of not being a chameleon and while he\'s running on the Dem ticket he doesn\'t owe them squat. I\'m willing the worst nightmare for the Dems at the top is Bernie winning because they don\'t have strings to pull. Why has Bernie not gotten anything done? Because no one wants him to. Being President though gives the Bully Pulpit and Teddy R knew how to use that. I think Bernie will too. '

aS"Its not about getting things done for the sake of getting things done, the path we are headed on is towards oligarchy so the idea is to get us off that path.

He is our best hope to do that, no one is saying it will be easy. Obama like Hillary was funded by Wall street, so in a sense he was always a trojan horse. His biggest accomplishment was the ACA a program based off of one implemented by a Republican Governor. Now he is trying to ram the TPP through congress.

What Sanders fears for our country is what most people fear for our country. Congress can fuck around all they want, but when the people see them standing in the way of things that have to be done, he won't care about the Machine's feelings. I also believe he'll actually lead and bolster people unlike Obama who just nods, says a few obligatory things and moves on. Bernie will tell you how you're being fucked by the system and I know how strongly he feels about that because that's his priority. Showing people how they've been getting fucked all this time is sure to bring more people to the table and I don't think they'll be happy. That's what Obama has failed to do.

aS'But unlike Obama, Sanders might recognize that the fight is right in front of him and must be fought: get out the veto pen and demand immediate action on anti-corruption reforms. If he gets elected on that platform, the people will back him up. Obama ran on changing Washington but when given the chance he stuck to politics as usual; in his defense, he came into the presidency just after an economic collapse, and it could be argued that pragmatism was more important at that point than idealism. Obamacare might not have happened at all, in any form, without "politics as usual." But in his last four years, he still hasn\'t shown any willingness to fight hard for things like campaign finance reform. Bernie Sanders, I think, would throw down the gauntlet immediately if he were stonewalled. He realizes it\'s now or never.'

That is dependent on advertisement. Isn\'t just going to give the man free space. You are dependent if you want to get your side of the story out.

p379
aS"Yes, Obama got many people excited in 2008 and Bernie is doing the same now.  Here are some major differences that it is worth noting:\n\n* Obama was a one-term Senator with a short and fairly mediocre  voting record (for example, he voted in favor of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008).  We didn't have a whole lot to judge other than his words.\n\n* Bernie's been in the House or the Senate since 1991, he has a voting record that is consistent with his words, and he was never propped up by the Democratic Party in the way that Obama was (remember, Obama was selected to give the keynote address at the 2004 DNC).\n\n"
p380
aS"Yeah, but Obama activated more black voters.  So even though they both got 95% I'm positive Obama effected minority turnout way more than Gore or Dukakis, especially in 2008.  I'm looking for numbers for total minority votes in the 3 years so I can continue this discussion with some data :)"

At the very least, it signals that Bernie Sanders has had a very different fundraising landscape than Clinton has had in the past, which makes sense, since he's only run in a small state as an overwhelming favorite to win."

Or put more bluntly, he is uniquely positioned to *ask* the public to support his agenda by leaning on their members of congress, senators, state officials, etc.\n\nFor whatever reason(s), President Obama has been unwilling to take the gloves off, and speak bluntly and directly to the American people.  I don\'t see that being Bernie Sanders way *at all.*  He\'s more in the mold of "the two Roosevelts", if anything.\n\n^(edit: caught spelling error)'

aS"yea, Obama was somewhat of an internet candidate, but not wholly. i'm probably one of the more politically involved people i know, and i don't really vote (which is unfortunate). i plan on getting more deeply involved in the future, it's just tough from my financial/geographical position. i think an initial step would be to make voting day a national holiday. it would give people even less of an excuse to feign ignorance.

aS"President Obama ran the same, non-traditional, war of ideas campaign in 2008. He picked Joe Biden as his running mate. Why? Because Biden had the years in the Senate, the experience, that Obama didn't have. That was a political move. Choosing a VP is an inherent political move. If Bernie wins the nomination, he can win votes or he can lose votes with who he picks as his VP. I want him to win votes."

aS"You're right - no single person can change things alone.  However, I don't think I'm mistaken when I say that millions of us are disenchanted and/or downright angry about the direction our country has gone.  \n\nFor a long time, we've been without a way to come together to make change.  I think many of us expected Obama to speak on our behalf more.  Unfortunately he compromised too easily and did too much negotiation behind closed doors -- excluding us in the process.  \n\nObama did not use the bully pulpit near as much as I hoped.  Consequently voters didn't even know when or how to put pressure on their obstructionist Representatives and Senators.  He often doesn't act like he needs citizens to help.\n\nExamples:  A public option for insurance -- Obama didn't ask us to help push for that; he just gave in.  Trade agreement -- he treats it as if it's none of our business and that we should trust him to put together an agreement with only the input of corporations and a few other powerful people.   \n\nThat is not Bernie's style.   Bernie will do a much better job of telling us who is obstructing change &amp; what we need to do to help him get legislation passed.  We've been needing a pitbull in the Oval Office; it's not enough to be a benevolent president and smart.  \n\nHe (or she) needs to  be inclusive of average citizens when it comes to making decisions and taking action.  We are the ones who can drive our House Representatives to make change, but we need a coordinated effort.\n\nBernie is skilled at defining a problem, and I think he'll be able to move the masses into action in a constructive way.

The obstructionism isn't so easily removed by an incensed populace, no matter how often Obama uses the bully pulpit. In fact, many considered his usage of it as being too often, so it's a complicated situation. \n\nThe point of citizens forcing Reps to make changes just doesn't fly with me. We're looking at a 90% incumbency advantage for re-election and even in Presidential election cycles the percentage of eligible voters doesn't go above 65%. Reps don't generally need to worry about what the voters will do because when it comes to voting they'll vote largely for whoever is already in office and, since it costs so bloody much to run in the first place, there's hardly any choices available to get someone else in office. \n\nYou're right, it needs a coordinated effort,but it also needs fundamental structural changes. Getting above 90% voting would be great but to do so requires changes to voting laws, making the day a holiday, putting money into balloting stations, etc. I'm at a loss as to how that gets done."

aS'&gt;Despite Hillarys ambitions, she is unlikely to get the Democratic Partys nomination in 2016 for a number of reasons. Hillary is far too cozy with Wall Street, and has what many in the public would consider a skewed opinion on poverty. She herself thinks like a wealthy person, the 1%, and cannot hide these attitudes. Where Obama gave her an opportunity to flesh out her resume as Secretary of State, Benghazi occurred on her watch and any Republican opponents will not let this rest. And despite public appearances as a married couple and with a new grandchild, the specter of Bills constant and continuing sexual exploits is one such factor.\n\n&gt;This reflects on Hillary, as it begs the question of why Bill is constantly seeking sex outside of his marriage. Whats wrong with Hillary? And why didnt she divorce him years ago? The conclusion is that her ambitions, that it is her turn to be President, are driving her decisions. Bill is a consummate politician, helping any candidate on the campaign trail, as is well known. Hillary hopes that if they hide his escapades, the past will fade away and she can finally be anointed President. Now it is clear that the opposite will happen. Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker were involved in mutual charities with Epstein, but only Bill went to the Caribbean island. No denials or objections will suffice. The public will reach another conclusion.\n\n--**ZetaTalk** Chat Q&amp;A for January 10, 2015 | http://zetatalk.com/ning/10ja2015.htm'

He also fucked up big time on his foreign policy.\n\n\nIn the end though, President Obama saved the Union, and that is what we needed. Those comparisons to Lincoln back in 07/08 weren't due to his race, but due to his role as a stabilizing force within the American biosphere.\n\n\nOn an economic level, dare I say it, he has been one of the best leaders this country has seen.

If independent parties want to stand a chance, they need to start at the bottom (municipal/state elections) and work their way up to federal.\n\nRemember, everyone thought Obama meant hope and change too.

Please keep in mind that in these situations the embryo is already dead or dying and won't make it if the mother dies.\n\nThe bill stalled because Obama promised to veto it.  If a republican were president, he wouldn't have agreed to veto it and it may well be in effect now.\n\nThis same party has pushed the maternal death rate to 3rd world levels and behind several middle eastern and Asian nations.  \n\nSo yeah, it would be nice to vote for some unproven independent and pat yourself on the back.

That's why President Obama is urging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage and give low-wage workers a much-needed boost.\n\nGive that site a read through. I'm done here, thanks!"

If he were more aggressive, it might well have backfired.  \n\nI have other issues with Obama that shows he is not as much of a progressive as I hoped (supporting spying, drone attacks, trying to fast track the trade agreement, not doing enough about Wall Street or war crimes such as torture). Bernie has a track record of consistently pushing for progressive change for years.\n\nIt feels like it's time for a dramatic change, and Bernie may be able to generate enough extra buzz in the election to get more people out to vote.  \n\nRegarding changing voting laws:  I agree.  In Oregon, we have vote by mail, and it is working great.  We have a paper trail, and it is very easy to vote at home.

Fast Track authority is a tragic joke that deserves to be rejected. \n\nFast Track Authority (aka TPA) would also deprive Congress of the ability to jettison any provisions which it found unacceptable.  Since Congress is dominated by right wing stupid ideologues, Conservatives would ensure that every trade agreeement which came before them over the next 5 years (what Obama has requested) would have the legislative skids greased so Obama and whoever succeeds him can rubber stamp an expansion of free trade stupidity in the very same manner too.

Total dollar expenditures are not an indicator of success, but in the Dem primary I see it being much more difficult for Sander\'s small donor approach to raise enough money to be able to match what Hillary can spend having courted large donors. Finally, it\'s important to note that the Koch brothers, Adelson, and other GOP donors are playing a much larger game than just the presidency - they money their organizations spend at the state levels have very real and serious effects on local legislation and regulation.'

If he was trying to emulate a CEO, he did a terrible job. \n\nIf anything, Obama has run the country like a business. It was failing when he took over, so he approved a huge budget to spur R&amp;D and growth, and, with a little pressure from congress, almost all legislation since the stimulus has matched new expenses with new revenue... and our budget deficit has been declining for multiple years now.

Remember when Pelosi said that raising unemployment benefits was the best thing to do to get money in the economy, she was lying. NASA has around a 7:1 benefit and her greatest was around 2.5:1.

He must be thwarted politically because a victory for him is a loss for my team.\n\nSo if you've got conservative relatives (like I do) who subscribe to one or more of these premises, it doesn't do you any good to point out that the Republicans in congress have used the filibuster (okay, prevented a cloture vote) at a historic level in blocking Obama's efforts. They see that as a good thing. To them, me complaining about that makes about as much sense as complaining about the California Board of Parole repeatedly denying parole for Charles Manson.\n\n**World view:** Aside from the partisan issues, there is a huge world view difference. Conservatives see liberals as being prone to hand-wringing and worrying about things that just shouldn't be that big of a deal. In short, Liberals are a bunch of pussies. Liberals make a big fuss over whatever the current hysteria is, and soon enough, there's a whole slew of new rules we have to worry about. When someone dismisses these rules as merely being *politically correct*, it's easy to hear the disdain and resentment they feel for being told they need to change because of someone else's values.\n\nIn addition to being pussies, many conservatives believe liberals in the government are corrupt. In much the same way that conservative politicians are suspected of kowtowing to their donors' priorities, many conservative voters believe that the push for spending to combat Climate Change is being driven by those who would benefit financially by such efforts. Additionally, they believe that new laws would be restrictive (carbon emission standards, etc.,) and hurt big businesses, who as everyone knows, are Job Creators.\n\n**Mistrust of Science:** Finally, there is a prevalent mistrust/dislike of science for many conservative religious fundamentalists. When your religion makes up such a huge part of your community and self identity, it's natural to resent or dislike the people and the methods that contradict many of your sacred beliefs. If I draw strength and reassurance from the belief that I am one of the chosen favorites of the omnipotent creator of the universe, I'd have a lot invested in the pillars of that belief structure. If I believe that God created mankind as described in the Bible and as taught to me since I was a child, it would be hard for me to be accepting of someone who told me otherwise. It would be hard for me to look into evolution critically and actually evaluate it for myself, because the truth is, I really wouldn't want to know. I'd be terrified of what it would mean if I found compelling evidence that part of my religious foundation was built out of lies or ignorance. And so I'd view science not just as confusing and inaccessible, but as a general assault on God. To me, those people (scientists) wouldn't be looking for answers about the universe; they'd be trying to disprove God.\n\nIn addition, if I believed the omnipotent creator of the universe were running the show, it wouldn't make sense that he'd let me ruin the whole shebang by driving my Hummer too much. So that would be another case of my religion telling me one thing and scientists and liberals telling me something that contradicts.\n"

I have the same views and felt the same way, but made my first donation ever a few days ago (I'm late-20s, liked Obama but wasn't nearly as excited about him). Better Hillary than more Scalia's and another Bush, but that does NOT have to be our choice. and no I don't think he's a saint or even agree with him on everything (I'm not reflexively anti-trade deals for example) but he's the only authentic candidate speaking up about, linking, and most importantly NOT A PART OF, political corruption and extreme inequality."
p449
aS'I don\'t even know where to begin with this.   \n\nFirst of all, roughly 40% of Republicans are a-OK with gay marriage. About a quarter of Democrats are not. Up until about 3 years ago, Obama was on the record as counting himself among them.   \n\nNo one, Republican or Democrat, wishes for a society where "gays are ridiculed and forced to keep a secret instead of living life as who they are and contributing to the greater good of society."  \n\nThat\'s just a total miscategorization of an idea you don\'t understand.  \n\nIf gays can have their marriages recognized by the state, it stands to reason that so can any other couple. Siblings will get married. Parents and children will get married. If you\'re going to keep that illegal, you\'ll have to explain why in a manner that is congruent with your positions on gay marriage. You can\'t. It\'s going to happen.  \n\nThe future where the government offers to recognize any and all pairings between two people as a "marriage" is one in which the highest authority in the land has declared "as far as we are concerned, there is no connection between marriage and reproduction". Marriage, as a legal institution primarily for the purpose of raising the next generation, is thereby abolished. It is a foundational social institution for doing society\'s most important work, and you want the government to say it no longer has any interest in it as such. If someone finds a problem with this, the only possible explanation is that they\'re a homophobe and wants to see gay people ridiculed back into the closet? Come on.  '

aS"They've been within error tolerances. You have no idea what you're talking about. I actually read atmospheric science. Obama doesn't have a place in the discussion of the validity of dynamics.\n\nYes, I understand hubris. I understand your hubris trying to debate something you don't understand with people who do and pretending you are right, or that your opinion is meaningful.\n\nYou never answered my question. Do you debate medicine with your doctor? PDEs with a PhD mathematician? Gravity with a physicist? Law with an attorney?"

aS"&gt;Aren't there one or two states that don't do winner-takes-all for the presidential vote?\n\nIt's Maine and Nebraska you're thinking of.\n\n&gt;In those places do they assign delegates by district or proportional to the total popular vote?\n\nThey assign two electoral votes based on the statewide result, and then one for each district. In the two states in question, the impact is small. In Maine, you can only possibly steal one electoral vote while losing the state, and in Nebraska, you can only steal two (Obama got just one of Nebraska's votes in 2008). In a larger state though, you could potentially steal away a much larger share of the votes, especially if it's been badly gerrymandered!\n\nI don't know how likely it is to actually happen though. Splitting your state's votes is generally seen as a negative for a state, since it diminishes the potential value of that state in an election. Candidates will put a lot of effort into winning a state that will net them 16 votes. Split your votes so that even the loser gets 6 or 7 votes, and the candidates will focus their efforts on another state. Such vote splitting propositions get talked about a lot, but there is usually a lot of push back against the idea as well."

Contrary to past free trade agreement practices, this is a Constitutional violation since meaningful economic legislation ***should*** face a full-throated legislative vetting process in Congress, not get rubber-stamped without that process.  The legislative alternative, you favor here, is a tragic joke that deserves to be rejected. \n\nFast Track Authority (aka TPA) would also deprive Congress of the ability to jettison any provisions which it found unacceptable.  Since Congress is dominated by right wing stupid ideologues, Conservatives would ensure that every trade agreeement which came before them over the next 5 years (what Obama has requested) would have the legislative skids greased so Obama and whoever succeeds him can rubber stamp an expansion of free trade stupidity in the very same manner too.

aS"Yep. When considering the 2000 election, you have to look at who Bush was running against. Gore was an uninspiring candidate who didn't appeal to anyone on a personal level and didn't really appeal to leftists that well. There's a reason Nader got 3-4% of the national vote. \n\nThat matters in Presidential elections.

aS'Exactly!  When they write Sen. Sanders off, many in the Clinton camp are feigning amnesia about 2008 where the youth vote came out in droves for the populist candidate Obama (shame that President Obama wound up so different than candidate Obama).  We need to do the same for Sanders.'

aS"No, she wasn't. John Edwards was perceived to be just as likely to get the nomination and had plenty of supporters (though like the GWB voters you won't get them to admit it now), plus the backing of some of the establishment.\n\nShe also had outside the mainstream challengers with both real support and a chance to win the general election. Notably Chris Dodd (with a legislative history of reform), Bill Richardson (a hispanic popular with younger voters and progressives), and Wesley Clark (a veteran general running in an season where Iraq was fucking us up big time) got a significant amount of grassroots support, and even monetary suppport, in the run up to the primary season.\n\nEven Obama had been a dark horse, also with significant grassroots support, since 2004. He didn't come out of nowhere and his supporters were *very* vocal long before he announced any candidacy. "
p466
aS'No he doesn\'t.  His record speaks for itself.  He\'s been proving he\'s a progressive throughout his political career.\n\nAs I said elsewhere in this thread, if you doubt Sen. Sanders\' progressivism, read up on him.  Check out his page on [ontheissues.org](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Bernie_Sanders.htm).  Check out some of his speeches on [his Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SenatorSanders).\n\nIf you doubt his commitment to progressive causes, it\'s because you have not attempted to educate yourself about his policy stances and causes he\'s fought for over the course of his political career.\n\n&gt;But big time politics, national, requires a more nuanced politics\n\nBernie Sanders has campaigned in as many elections as "Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama combined."  That\'s literally in the first paragraph of the article.  Sen. Sanders is experienced in campaigning, and he\'s won many races that his detractors claimed were impossible for him to win.'

p471
aS"I think you're safe. Obama had only a few years of federal legislative experience behind him, which meant that his rhetoric, while inspiring, was also empty. He allowed people to project their own progressive desires onto his campaign.\n\nSanders has been in Congress for many years. He's done so outside of the two-party system for the entirety of his service. He's been consistent (and consistently amazing) throughout his entire career. He supported gay marriage back in the 90s. He opposed Iraq and the Patriot Act right off the bat. He is projecting his *own* progressive desires onto his campaign and allowing people to see that, and that makes him manifold more trustworthy and predictable than Obama ever was. If he actually went moderate upon winning the race, I'd probably eat my own shoes out of sheer shock and adopt the Bill Hicks notion that Presidents are forcefully controlled by a small room of conspiring, cigar-smoking movie mafiosos."
p472
aS'Sanders has a track record, unlike what presidential candidate Barack Obama had. I have much more confidence in Sanders sticking to his guns, than Obama. Obama worked with the political capital he had, but sometimes I felt he stepped down from issues he could have won. I believe Sanders will fight continuously to achieve what he believes to be right.'
p473
aS"Hillary won't lose a debate, she is a very intelligent lady. She will just co-opt all his most popular ideas, lying through her teeth the entire time.  When she gets into office she will just give everyone the finger and continue to do what her oligarch supporters paid her to do.  \n\nIf you can remember, Obama got into office because he was the opposite of Bush.  Once in office he simply continued neocon military and fiscal policy.  Hillary will do the same thing, although it might be harder to fool people as her warmongering track record and the love she gets from Goldman Sachs and oligarchs is right out in the open.  Obama's history was not widely known, so people believed his promises."
p474
aS"He polled at 14% before he announced- before 'most' people knew about him. This time in 2007, Obama polled at 17% while Hillary was 35%. Things change."
p475
aS"No, it wouldn't have. Gore lost by 5 electoral votes, New Hampshire was 4 votes. Gore would've needed to both win New Hampshire (lost by 2%) and he would've needed to win a state like Nevada (lost by 4%). Or, he'd have needed to win a state like Colorado (lost by 8%, Nader got 5.25%) with 8 votes, or Ohio (lost by 4%) with 21 votes. Only in one of those states was Nader arguably 'at fault' for the loss (New Hampshire), with the others it was mostly just rubbing salt into the wound.\n\nWhat the 2000 election should've told the Democratic leadership is: Don't ignore the left. Whether they like it or not, the left is still the 'base'. . .they can stay home, vote Green, or vote for the Democrat. They aren't going to vote Republican. If enough people on the left feel the Democrat is ignoring them and issues that appeal to them, they might vote Green or stay home, causing problems for the Democrat. The centrists and the 'undecided' voters can't be relied on, are swayed by charismatic candidates that look good and give good speeches, and are supposed to be important *after* you've secured your base's support. You can't win on just the centrists and undecideds alone.\n\nThey had a similar problem in 2004. Kerry was long-winded, gave boring speeches that were likely to put people to sleep, and didn't have any unusual charisma or w/e. He also sold himself as a centrist who basically 'do what Bush does, but do it better!'.\n\nThis is up against an incumbent war president who at least was presiding over a then-healthy economy recovered from the .com collapse.\n\nObama won because he was different from Gore and Kerry. Yes, he is still effectively centrist, but he does it in a way that at least gives people on the left some hope that he'll fight for a few of their causes, and he energized some of the base. He had a well-run campaign that utilized some pretty good tactics and ground-campaigning, stuff Hillary Clinton would be well-advised to use."
p476
aS"It makes him special because unlike Clinton, he isn't a damn shill. If you want more of what Obama gave us - false promises, mass surveillance, torture, secrecy, assassinations... Vote for Clinton. You'll get more of the same. \n\nIf you want actual progressive change, vote for Bernie. The guy who speaks sincerely and has a voting record to back it up. Example: Clinton talks tough against the patriot act *now* because it's not popular at the moment. Guess who voted for the patriot act back in October 2001? Clinton. Guess who voted against it every time? Sanders\n\nI'll support Rand Paul because I'm a libertarian, but Sanders is the only genuine-article Democrat running at this point. Let me know if Elisabeth Warren throws her hat in the ring and I'll need to reconsider my vote. Your party has some genuinely great people running for president and leading the party and you disgrace them with staggering ignorance. "
p477
aS"Wrong. In the Spring of 2007 Obama was consistently bouncing between the high teens and the low 30's. Some polls even had him tied with or beating Clinton, most had him within single digits of her.\n[source](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html#polls) \n\nIn contrast, Sanders is like 60 points behind Clinton, can't/won't raise serious cash, doesn't have the youth and charisma of an Obama, or the novelty/cool of being the first serious black presidential candidate. \n\nSeriously, as a Republican I'm telling you that if you want the White House it has to be Clinton. A Biden or an O'Malley loses by at least 5%, Sanders loses by at least 10% and gets wiped in the electoral college. Look at 1964 when the Republicans nominated hardline libertarian Barry Goldwater, it would be like that in reverse."
p478
aS"&gt; Atleast bush has great tax cuts and tax returns each year. Also far less social experiments in the military under Bush.\n\nHis tax cuts are far from great, a notion many economists agree with today. Bush took Clintons balanced budget and exploded it all to hell so I'm not sure what you're talking about. Bush's economic policy is widely considered a failure, especially given that the great recession started under him, and was made worse by his policies. I'm curious how you're able to take recent history, which is the country coming out of the worst recession in many decades, started under Bush, and then somehow say, while things are improving steadily, that somehow Obama is making things worse. It's pretzel logic. "

p484
aS'Yeah, especially wingnuts who say Obama is a Marxist, socialist, and a Muslim.'
p485
aS'If you look at his actual positions on the issues in comparison to what Obama ran on in 2008 they\'re pretty similar. Obama by all accounts was considered too progressive to be elected then and it ended up happening. However, you could argue that Obama ran during the perfect time for a perceived progressive candidate to run since people were so tired of Bush, and people tend to vote for a candidate of the challenging party when the incumbents approval ratings are low. That same effect could end up hurting Sanders in 2016 if people look to the Republican Party for change. \n\nAlso, if you look at our history, Sanders is actually not that much of a radical in comparison to past presidents. It\'s just that the Democratic Party has moved so far to the right in the past 30-40 years that he looks much more extreme. For instance, FDR had many of the same beliefs about the "super rich" and income inequality that Bernie has.'

aS'&gt;But Again, I\'m not trying to say Obama is trying to take over the country.

When you posted that, I assumed it reflected your views, because you didn\'t explain your perspective of the situations.\n\nI\'m through arguing with you. You need to learn how to more clearly communicate your points, explain their connections, and explain what they mean for us and our country. You keep jumping around from the situation in Texas, to police militarization, to the intelligence agencies, but it\'s like you\'re just pointing at them and saying "See!" You\'re not trying to explain those situations and your thoughts about them. You\'re not really saying anything.\n\nI actually agree with you on at least the latter two points, we need to prevent further police militarization and to reign in the intelligence agencies (I don\'t even know where you stand on the Texas thing), and I agree that in some cases, the government is curtailing our civil liberties.\n\nWhat I can\'t figure out is what you\'re trying to say about these things. It\'s wrong? No shit! What do you propose we do about it?\n\nHow do we fight corruption? How do we re-secure our lost rights? How do we provide better government oversight without coming off as paranoid lunatics?'

aS'Sanders is well to the left of Obama (who is not on the left at all, IMO). He, for instance, knows you guys have the right healthcare system, whereas Obama abandoned rational solutions for healthcare (like Medicare for All) as soon as he became a national figure. On the other hand, Obama capitulated enough to big donors and corporate power enough to win; Sanders has no chance and is doing this to get his message out.

aS'I\'ve been waiting to answer this question. What is his appeal?  I lived in Wisconsin when he first ran for governor. His advertising only hit on one point.  He adamantly opposed everything "Obama" .  The passion that Wisconsin\'s voter base had been waiting for. (remember the old lady from WI who professed to John McCain that  senator Obama was an arab) well they got this Walker guy elected.  The gravy trains flowed in for corporate beasts as the desolation for regular folks grew and good paying jobs started to dissappear. More people were working full or part-time for low wages and when they had a day off they were applying for foodstamps and badgercare. Well then one day some liberal called up the governor\'s office to play a joke and said he was a Koch brother (can\'t remember which one)  to his surprise walker was greatful to speak with his corporate overlord and pledged his allegiance.  And they caught it on tape! The liberals had him churned the recall elections around the corner and whether or not anyone cared,  on that day only the Republicans came out to vote.  As if the liberals were going to let a Muslim run this country AND IMPEACH their hero.  Their Governor. The way I see it the Dems didn\'t care enough to follow through and the few Republicans who kissed his ass and kissed the asses of his asskissers and so forth beat the odds and Walker won again.  Now that he\'s turned Wisconsin into Alabama, he got bored of being a governor and he\'s off flying around the world to kiss ceo ass and do interviews because in \'Murica you can drop out of higher education to work a telemarketer job and then become the next president elect.

Another was that he kept hoping the republicans would soften up on him, or that voters would see him as being reasonable and put pressure on republicans to soften up on him.  Maybe overly optimistic.  Perhaps a factor at least early on was that he was very cautious to avoid looking like the 'angry black man' that republicans would have loved dearly to have painted him as.  Another factor later on was that he perhaps wanted to make life easier for democrats in right leaning states; probably especially true in 2014.  Of course, they got shellacked anyways because young voters don't turn out for mid terms.  So yeah in retrospect I'm sure that Obama would agree that he should have used more aggressive rhetoric over all, but he did have his reasons for holding back."

The reality is they were just expecting too much from a system that favors stability over rapid change.  \n\nThis is ultimately damaging to democracy, and it\'s all because too many people are too uneducated on how the political system works.  It\'s perfectly avoidable if you approach politics more pragmatically, and stop looking at the presidency as a magical king throne that will make all your dreams come true.\n\nIt happened in 2008 with many Obama supporters, and so far the Sanders movement is looking remarkably similar.\n\nEdit:  broke up a lengthy sentence.\n\n'

p531
aS"&gt;Politics is as much or more perception than reality.\n\nThis is true to some extent.  But, the American people have gotten better at distinguishing policy substance from PR fluff.  Barack Obama defeated Hillary in 2008 by championing a superior policy platform.  While Obama didn't adhere to the economic platform he promised he would, the Democratic base and political independents knew Hillary would never champion the political agenda this country needs.  That trust issue is as much, if not more, on voters minds after Third Way Democrat Barack Obama refused to champion most of the sensible socio-economic reforms he should have the moment he was sworn into office in 2009.  Since Republican political operatives have recently mistaken Hillary's trust issues with the Democratic base as a political opportunity for them, it's not.  Conservative politicians suffer from a FAR worse trust issue with Americans throughout the political spectrum than Hillary does.  That's why every Democratic Presidential candidate would clean their clocks in the 2016 general election.    \n\nBernie doesn't suffer from the same trust issues and he is actually championing a political agenda that appeals to Americans on the left, right and middle of the political agnda.  Why is his agenda so effective?  He is going straight at the special interest groups who have corrupted the federal government to the point of utter dysfunction.  That's a political strategy/platform that neither Republicans, Libertarian, Tea Party nor Third Way Democratic candidates would dare to employ out of fear that it would cause their plutocratic Sugar Daddies to close their wallets."

He honestly might not have even won Iowa without her. \n\n\nBut people seem to have this conception that Obama easily won that race in 2008, it was incredibly close in delegate count by the end and if not for a few key moments (bill's mistake in South Carolina, Ted Kennedy endorsement, Oprah's involvement etc) it could have gone the other way.

Usually as we get closer to the election the conversation narrows and everyone accepts that the game is the game, its played a certain way and we are all in it until the election is over for good or ill..........this time the conversation is broadening....and if it gets wide enough it could really change how the election goes.\n\n\nand all of that is about how much money sanders can raise....its important.\n\nif you polled people today Sanders would hardly rate and it would be meaningless for predicting anything besides what people will think tomorrow.

Obama has ties to Goldman Sachs and other Wallstreet firms. Guess who wasn't punished when they caused the financial system to melt down? \n\nThat wiped out lots of people's savings, caused them to lose their jobs, etc. It was severely damaging to the middle class and poor. Some of the kids from that era just entering the work force will never, ever recover from it because jobs were lost forever or retained by baby boomers who lost their nest eggs. They also have massive debts to pay off. The wealthy of course walked away just fine and dandy, if not richer now than ever.\n\nMeanwhile you have the TPP getting rammed down our throats and the Democrats as a whole are either supporting it, or doing nothing about it. There's Warren and Sanders who are publicly against it, but they are more liberal and progressive than the usual Democrat. The Democratic party now has everyone but the far right authoritarians and pseudo-anarcho-capitalists in it, and that's a lot of different political views.\n\nYes, the Democrats aren't pissing on NASA or denying simple scientific facts but there are still people in the party who are accomplices to the dirty things big business and the wealthy are doing in this country. We have a serious problem that crosses party lines here, and that is big money influencing politics. We need serious progressive reform, and I do think that this can only come from within the Democratic party. The Republicans are too far gone down the runaway right-winger path, they're self-entitled ingrates, and they're proud to basically not use their critical thinking abilities in favor of some quasi-common-sense that ends up being pure lunacy."

aS'You\'re right that it doesn\'t make sense to adjust for inflation on a relative debt percentage. Phrases like "doubling the debt" make as much sense in 1800s dollars as 2015 dollars, with no inflation adjustment necessary.\n\nHowever, I don\'t think relative debt percentage is a useless metric though. Mainly because as a country\'s population increases, the scale of funds processed by the country is also expected to increase. The USA was about 32% more populous when Obama started than when Reagan started, which your inflation-adjusted flat dollars metric does not consider. Relative-percentage is a simple way to account for differing scales.\n\nWe can also account for the population increase by hand, which may be more accurate. Taking your number, 5.2 trillion, times 1.32 (population increase since 1980), then Obama would have needed to hit 6.9 trillion to top Reagan once you adjust for population increase.'

aS'I\'ll stick with the topic.\n\nYour claim about Arkansas was: "Its one of the most equitable [in terms of wealth distribution] states in the Union."  The data above proves your statement false.  Your statement can\'t be used to justify why household income growth in Arkansas has not increased at the same rate as the national household incomes.  I added data to show 68% of states had median incomes rise at a higher rate during the same period.  \n\nYou said \n&gt;"In a country where the income from labor has been basically stagnant since 1990, this is actually pretty impressive." AND "So while he lied by omission [via not mention inflation], it is still an impressive accomplishment to run on."  \n\nI am of the opinion that lagging behind the national household income increase and behind more than half of the other states in the country is not impressive.\n\nAlso, politifact shows President Obama does not "pull shit like this on a regular basis".  Your comparison only shows that the President has been under a microscope for over 500 statements and huckabee only ~30.  Huckabee\'s statements were false over half the time and 13% were the worst possible rating.  Obama was false 27% of the time but only 2% of the worst rating.\n\nThat speaks very well for Obama when compared to Huckabee... but that isn\'t very difficult.'

So for Obama to have added more debt than every president before him, the debt would have to be $22 trillion.\n\nThen on top of that, you can't do a straight dollar amount comparisons because 1950s dollars or 1970s dollars or 1980s dollars aren't the equivalent to 2015 dollars."

aS"He won't be able to. So many of these elections are about charisma and likeability because most American voters don't super care about the actual issues.

How far are you willing to compromise your principles? From where I stand, I see the likely democratic nominee, Clinton, as a republican. I see a corporate--war-mongering--shill. I am not voting for that. Obama looked much more moderate to me than Hillary, yet I was still unsatisfied.

aS"Pot is still illegal all across the country. Yes, people like to say it's legal in a handful of states+DC, but that's bullshit.\n\nThe reason people are not getting arrested en masse in those states is because Obama decided to let them slide.

But Obama has created a new status quo, and the more inertia it gets the harder it will be to change."

Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, was first lady during Clinton's numerous acts of aggression (bonbing Iraq, so-called humanitarian intervention in Yugolsavia). Also, Obama invaded a country (Libya) with no approval from Congress with little protest from partisan Dems. It is a maddening circle.

aS"Yes democrats have spoken against it, but they haven't stopped using it. But the main point of what I was getting at is that most of Hillary's platform is designed to tap into the same hope/change shit Obama did. The problem being her track record doesn't support that rhetoric. Why anyone on the left would fall for the same shtick again confuses me. \n\nWhat the president can do, such as diplomacy, military action, not signing bills such as the renewal of the Patriot Act, certain drug policies, etc.,  Hillary will fail to deliver on just as Obama has because all those things are issues she she believes in (or at least her previous actions have supported). Bernie is like a sane Ron Paul, that's why people like him. He has a record of doing what he says."

aS"&gt;  But Hillary hasn't even hinted at that she takes this issue seriously. She just says it as a quicky to get attention, but has no intention to do much about it.\n\nI'll wager $100 that if Hillary is elected, she'll sign any campaign finance reform legislation that comes to her desk, and that if she's in for 8 years she'll place liberal justices on the SCOTUS who will side with the anti-corporatist side of any cases that come to the court. We know that she obviously isn't a fan of the *Citizens United* movie or the forthcoming *Clinton Cash* book that smears her using soft money. Nor is she a fan of the swiftboating PAC from the 2004 election. So no, this isn't a recent change for her. When she says **campaign finance reform is one of the 4 pillars of her campaign**, there is reason to believe it. \n\n&gt; Sort of like when Obama would win people over by mentioning weed, then once he got in, he forgot all about it.\n\nhttp://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/07/exclusive-in-his-second-term-obama-will-pivot-to-the-drug-war.html\n\nThis talks about what can actually be done from the office of the president, and what Obama has actually done.

I think he's probably the 14th best president the US has had and it would've been hard for anyone else to have done a much better job under the conditions he was facing. \n\n&gt; The problem being her track record doesn't support that rhetoric.\n\nActually it does.

aS'Thank you for making this one easy on me.\n\nFirst, the argument that Obama is responsible either way isn\'t mine. I simply parroted the rhetoric used by those who will reflexively support anyone with an (R) and argue anyone with a (D) after their names.  I could parrot the opposite if necessary, but in this case, what I wrote was both relevant and completely accurate.\n\nSure, the President plays a role, but he isnt responsible for the turnaround or slowness of turnaround, etc alone. Its much bigger than that. It was a worldwide problem and despite continued hiccups across the pond, things have been oddly positive here the last few months.\n\nBut, if you want to put it all on his shoulders, and compare him to someone like, say, Reagan...\n\n"Economically, President Obamas administration has outperformed President Reagans in all commonly watched categories.  Simultaneously the current administration has reduced the deficit, which skyrocketed under Reagan.  Additionally, Obama has reduced federal employment, which grew under Reagan (especially when including military personnel,) and truly delivered a smaller government.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2014/09/05/obama-outperforms-reagan-on-jobs-growth-and-investing/2/\n\n\nSo, about that recovery... better by at least a few measures than what Reagan led, so no not the worst recovery since the GD. And no, I am not a liberal. I am not aligned with either party. I am an American, and I am tired of the BS between parties that fails to do any real good. So label me if you want, but I have and will continue to vote for the best candidates from each party.\n\nCountry before party. Always.'
p614
aS"&gt; Republican partisan\n\nlolwhat? not even close\n\n&gt; But Obama has a law degree and experience in federal government. Romney's political experience was at a state level.\n\nThis just makes you sound like a DEMOCRAT partisan. You stated executive experience was important. Romney had that, Obama didn't. Which is it? Don't even try to pretend a President needs a law degree."
p615
aS"Sad to see that Obama doesn't support Wall Street reform. Im guessing he has some donors there. "
p616
aS"I mean that Democrats are taking money as well. But another point is that it is easy to put forward populist bills when you know that the other party controlling both legislatures will prevent it from passing. I'd be more interested in seeing those counts if democrats were majorities, and just looking by how hard it was for Obama to pass his main campaign promise of healthcare reform (which failed to have a single payer provision) in a democratically controlled House and Senate, I'd be willing to bet some of those votes may change. Regardless, I find it hypocritical that Democrats will talk about how bad campaign finance is, but they won't hold themselves to a higher standard.\n\nWe can't really know what Obama would have done if Republicans didn't block his every move, and that's unfortunate. But the fact is, on the things he could change (drug policy, military intervention, diplomacy (recently regarding TPP)), he hasn't really done all that much for liberal causes. I think you're right, he's a fine president if you have centrist views, but for people such as myself, those things he failed to do matter a lot. I think the most disappointing thing of all is that he didn't veto the renewal of the Patriot Act. He could have forced the House to vote 2/3 (only 250 voted yea, when 290 is required to pass veto), and more likely could have forced debate and restrictions with that veto. But he didn't do that.\n\nMaybe I'm not giving credit to her for what she does support. I guess I just don't see her changing her foreign policy and domestic security policies that Obama has continued from Bush. But I assume she hasn't actually spoken against those things, so I am wrong about that. \n\nI would be fine though with Obama part 3 if the other choice was only a republican, but I would much rather have someone like Bernie. And frankly Bernie has ethos; I believe he will try to deliver on his promises. I just think establishment Democrat politicians will say they support things just to get elected. Hopefully I will be proven wrong since it's unlikely Bernie will receive the nomination."

aS'Alright these questions are making an entirely different argument than the ones you first posed. Your initial questions suggested he should bear no responsibility, everything was already in place. Your new questions are debatable but what\'s not debatable is that candidate Obama led voters to believe he would act much differently on marijuana than he has. \n\nDuring his campaign, Obama criticized the Bush raids saying, "I\'m not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue." Now if the argument is he really has no control over the Justice Department, don\'t say that shit. If the argument is it wouldn\'t have been feasible to get a pro-pot AG confirmed, that\'s definitely a possibility but in that case still, don\'t say that shit.

When he says he's promising to do something, you can actually trust that promise.\n\nWhether it's *possible* for him to do it is another matter entirely, but since Constitutional amendments can be brought forth by the populace with a Congressional Convention, he doesn't actually need Congress to support the amendment. All he needs to do is gain access to the bully pulpit and rally the electorate around him so that we have a unified plan of attack to call for a CC and implement the amendment ourselves. It's really quite plausible, assuming he's able to defeat the Clinton machine to get the DP nomination (and win against the Republican nominee, but that shouldn't be too hard in comparison)."
p628
aS'&gt;Still, the bill stands a near-zero chance of becoming law. Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, also backed the bill, but it has no Republican support. Republicans hold the majority in both houses of Congress.\n\nI feel like, as the Sanders hype train begins to depart the station, we all need to keep this in mind. Remember, Obama played the hope and change card too, and he genuinely tried to complete most, if not all, of the things he promised to do. \n\nThen what happened? Republicans happened. They stonewalled anything and everything he wanted to accomplish or gave passing approval of. I cannot imagine that any of that is going to change if a self-professed *Socialist* is elected a president. '

aS'A liberal only phenomenon? \n\nConservative politicians have held up important legislation to get what they want. (affordable care act)\nConservative politicians frequently vote against what the people want in favor of special interests. (comcast merger)\nThe speaker of the house regularly holds secret votes with far too few representatives so they may pass legislation behind closed doors. \n\nObama is exercising executive powers at this point because it is the ONLY way we can get our government to accomplish anything during one of the most important periods in our history. \n'

p636
aS'yep. And it is for most people that live in the country since over 50% have been shown to be in favor of guns and do not want more gun laws. That and most people of the south feel that way also. One of the main reasons why Obama won so much is because he never really said too much about guns or about any legislation he had planned for guns. \n\nI feel strongly about guns for several reasons but for the most part bc I dont trust my gov or its police. and I am sure a lot of people from boston would at least partly agree with that. that is why I feel so strongly about it.\n'
p637
aS'I disagree. Sanders is a fairly popular Congressman whereas Obama was barely a blip on the radar. Even before he announced he was going to be running he was on shows being interviewed - no something common for people with the exception of majority leader, minority leader, and Speaker of the House.'
p638
aS"Because the article gives an unsourced and vague mention of how Obama doesn't want to change Dodd-Frank?\n\nSeems like you're gonna need some citations at the least. And once you've got that, then we can talk about the wider debate of *why* he holds the position. People who just say write vacuous shit like this should get banned. But I'm sure you'll be upvoted and I'll be downvoted because at the end of the day, reddit is kind of dumb. "
p639
aS"Obama followed through by agreeing to sign campaign finance reform laws like **DISCLOSE Act**. And he also placed judges on the SCOTUS who support campaign finance reform. But you don't care about that apparently. "
p640
aS"These numbers are meaningless without context. Sanders has sponsored 319 bills over the course of 24 years. Consider Ben Rosenthal who sponsored [377 bills over the course of 11 years](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=409406) only to have three enacted--the same as Bernie. \n\nLet's pick names we know, though. [Obama sponsored 124 bills over 13 years and only 2 were enacted.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=400629) Over 8 years, Hillary Clinton sponsored 417 bills, and only 2 were enacted. [John Kerry sponsored 802 bills over 27 years](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=300060) and an astonishing 17 of them passed. John McCain is a bit distinctive. [Over 33 years he sponsored 806 bills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357#sponsor=300071) and 34 have them have been enacted. That's just over 1 per year! I'm not trying to shit on the topic, but most of those had to do with providing services to local Native Americans because Arizona has more reservation land than any other state in the country.\n\nThe point is that Sanders' sponsor to pass rate for bills isn't anything odd. He's an idealist, I guess, but *posturing*? Based on the pass rate of the bills he sponsors? Every person in congress sponsors bills knowing that it's got almost no chance to be enacted. It's just statistics. "
p641
aS"True, but one of the reasons that Obama managed to beat Hillary was the way he avoided mud-slinging, while Clinton did not. In a way, it made him seem to transcend the political bullshit. It's a valid tactic that's worked in the past against Clinton, so it would make sense for Sanders to employ it, but I guess we'll see what she's learned from it."

Obama has never been a governor. \n\nComparing growth of the entire nation is different, as I am sure you are aware, than a singlevstate, espcially a middling one (I mean no offense to Arkansas, as my grad alma mater is there, it's a wonderful place).\n\nWages have been stagnant for 30 years nationwide. GDP is growing nicely, though. \n\nEdit:. I quote the article in question.  If you are looking for a citation I would start there."

If you would like your voice to be heard get active. Can't sit behind a computer screen and make anything happen worthwhile."
p649
aS"Agreed but Obama is still a great president, especially with the shit show he was placed into from the very beginning.

aS"Let's be honest here: the President's economic agenda sucked. The economy is shit with consistently weak improvement, and if historical trends continue, we'll be in another recession within 2-3 years without most of us ever managing to climb out way out of the hole dug during the first two.\n\nAnd you can pretend to blame the GOP, but Obama had majorities, and he did nothing with them."
p654
aS"&gt; And you can pretend to blame the GOP, but Obama had majorities, and he did nothing with them.\n\nAgreed - the problem were the 'blue dog democrats' who like the 'Democrat' brand but god forbid them actually voting for a stimulus that is worth a damn. Inagine if every Democrat in congress and senate god behind the president from day one - passed a single payer healthcare package right off the bat then followed by massive tax reforms - cram as much legislation into 2 years and then for the next year the president veto's the living crap out of every GOP legislation that comes over his desk."

He will never run for office again, he's very wealthy and will make an absolute killing on speeches and publications when he leaves office, far more than Clinton does.

p659
aS"I don't think Obama is a total idiot and I don't think he would do this if it was blatantly hurting the middle class.  Maybe this is needed to stay ahead of the growing behemoth that is China and this agreement might kick start growth in Japan. The part about companies ability to sue the gov't for lost profits worries me though.  Corporations have too much power in gov't as it is and this gives them another avenue to fight regulation.  I just think it's shitty that the whole thing is behind closed doors but I don't think it's all bad."

The segment is heavy with implication in regards to her lack of credibility and decency on that matter.  'Cling to your guns' was far worse for Hillary then it was for Obama. She was already looking like a weak liar, and then she hopped on the conservative talking-point bandwagon (now a turncoat as well) while trying to paint herself as some salt-of-the-earth common person who hunts.  No one was buying it, and Obama's comedy routine wrecked her."

aS'Yes, let\'s just throw labels on everyone that you dislike and call them a conservative. \n\n1) Nixon was not a Conservative. \n\n2) Bloomberg was not a Conservative. \n\n3) Bush Jr. was certainly not a Conservative. \n\nAnd did the Democrats stop any of these things? Nope. \n\nAnd where are these conservatives defending the cops? You mean that crazy group of loonies you\'re fixated with?\n\nBut if you want to play this game, we can play it. I can easily bring up an entire list of things that Obama has done that can be considered Authoritarian. Let alone the lies and corruption that has gone on under him. \n\nHas he dismantled the surveillance state? Nope!\n\nWhat about those illegal drone strikes? Obama has done more war than Bush did!\n\nTransparent elections? "Everything will be on C-span!" \n\n"You can keep your doctor" \n\nOr how about Obama signing the NDAA, probably the most authoritarian of them all. Indefinite detention North Korea style. All while wearing a red tie. You know nothing, you\'re blinded by stupidity. \n\nLOL, I haven\'t even gotten started yet, shredding Obama is just too easy.\n\nNone of these people are Conservatives. Conservatives do not believe in North-Korea style governance. '

Lawmakers increased funding for fossil fuel research and development by $34 million over the 2015 budget, for a total of $605 million next year.\n\n... Obama can do whatever with the military right?  How about we blow some of their constantly increasing budget on this?  WAR ON POLLUTION or something.  \n\nHell, that trick could work with other things.  Want infrastructure spending?  Fund the military to build bridges! \n\nWant after school programs?  The "basketball with kids" platoon is on it.  \n\nSchool lunch programs need a boost?  Half a dozen 300 pound 7ft tall mountains of marines in  hair-nets serving mashed potatoes.  \n\nWe could do this.'
p665
aS"Ah yes, a classic [No True Scotsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman).  They don't get to call themselves conservatives then have their failures not count against the conservative ideology. Same with fox news. \n\nAs for Obama, yes he does have plenty of failures.  That is not the topic at hand however. We are discussing conservatives and their policies regarding policing. Unless you are saying Obama is a conservative he has no place in this discussion. "
p666
aS'&gt; Alright these questions are making an entirely different argument than the ones you first posed. \n\nEh? Me?\n\n&gt; what\'s not debatable is that candidate Obama led voters to believe he would act much differently on marijuana than he has.\n\nActually I think that is debatable as well. Saying "I\'m for position x" is not a promise, it is a statement of belief. And the president shouldn\'t be single handedly forcing a change on Americans they aren\'t ready for unless they want their entire presidency to be about that thing and nothing else. This article talks about what is realistic to expect from a president:\n\nhttp://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/07/exclusive-in-his-second-term-obama-will-pivot-to-the-drug-war.html\n\n&gt; During his campaign, Obama criticized the Bush raids saying, "I\'m not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue." \n\nAnd then things changed. There was a huge explosion of dispensaries operating in this very grey area of the law. '
p667
aS"Sorry, you don't get to disown Nixon, Bush or Bloomberg.  They're all conservatives and what conservatives do in power.  You may not like it, you may not agree with them, but thems the facts.  And as you rightly point out, the democrats have not stopped the screwed up policies of the right, because the democrats have been getting more and more conservative over the years.  Obama is more conservative than Reagan was, and he's in the middle of the democratic party these days.\n\nYou may want to rail again conservatives propping up an authoritarian government, but you'll damn sure keep voting for the ones that are doing it."

Obama was far behind Clinton for most of that period but shot up in the polls at the last minute. Bernie may be far behind now, but that could just be because not many people have heard about him yet. It's still so early."
p674
aS"Exactly.  All the progressives who voted Obama in just clapped themselves on the back, said 'our job's done', and then walked away.  Obama had only a couple months of a genuinely democratic congress in which he passed the ACA, and that's it.  The entire rest of the 8 years of his presidency he's been faced with Republicans trying to pass laws to repeal the ACA, blocking every nomination he tries to make, voting to default on the national debt, and vetoing every bill that he or any democrat proposes.  The progressive voters that handed him the presidency blame him for all this, but they stayed at home during both the 2010 and the 2014 midterms, handing the congress to republicans.\n\nThe lesson some of them learned is 'all politicians are lying shitheads, fuck politics'.  The real lesson is 'if you stay at home during mid terms, if you don't elect progressives to congress, to state legislatures, to state governorships, even all the way down to municipal comptroller, then don't piss and moan when the other side does show up to vote in their guys who make it their mission in life to sabotage your progressive president.'\n\nAll presidents are just the tip of a massive iceberg.  You can put the most ardent progressive in the world in the white house, but if the whole rest of the iceberg is conservative, he ain't goan be able to do shit."
p675
aS"Well reddit politics should probably be renamed /I'm-18-here-is-what-I-think but on the other hand it's not all meaningless.\n\nDon't forget Obama getting the younger crowd and the internet crowd was hugely important to his success. He was certainly not Ron Paul in terms of elections. Grass roots can be HUGE... if it takes off and isn't just viral horseshit. And somehow I wouldn't suspect a 70-year-old from Vermont of trying to pull viral horseshit."
p676
aS"Not good.  I know it sucks that this is the case, but just look at him.  He wouldn't stand a chance in the general these days based on appearance alone and the Dems know this.  People below are pointing out how Obama came out of nowhere to steal the nomination from Clinton, but Sanders /= Obama, not by a longshot.  "

aS"I used to believe this.  The problem is, the last election had the same problem. I knew Obama wasn't the right answer, but the 'less terrible' answer. After seeing his second term unfold, just like GWB's second term before him, I'm no longer convinced either party has it right.\n\nBoth parties have great ideas, but are too arrogant to admit the other party has valid points.  Example: I love the Republican idea of a balanced budget in 5ish years. The problem is they take a rational idea and wreck it by cutting and attempting to privatize social programs, and increasingly military spending instead.  \n\nRight message, Wrong delivery.\n\nAs a 40 year old who's been paying attention for about 15 years now, I'm really at a point of washing my hands of the situation.  I started voting third party based on who I believe in the most, and so what if my vote detracts from a candidate who might be negligibly worse than the other?  Honestly, I'll vote for a Republican like Rand Paul before I'd ever check off a box for Hillary. \n\nBernie's dead right - this country is effectively an elected oligarchy and I'm tired of rationalizing it."

aS'If you are paying more of the taxes than the national income you recieve then you are paying a disproportionate amount of the taxes in relation to the national income.

The solution always seem to be more government/regulation.\n\nB) I actually believed that their policies would only tax/affect the rich. Obama promised for years that if we like our plan we can keep it, and that no taxes would be levied against the middle class for obamacare. Both were obvious lies. I realize he's not a progressive in the sense that Sanders is, but he's still a liberal.\n\nI will add, I do think Sanders is dead on with a lot of issues. He didn't support the bail outs or the Iraq war, he was one of the first people in congress for gay marriage, he understands problems with our criminal justice system, he knows the fed is enabling the banking cartel. \n\nHim and liz warren seem to think the Fed can be fixed but I disagree. I can't trust the government to make a better centralized bank when they ALWAYS will be answering to corporations over us. The Fed was established by bankers for bankers, that will never change as long as it exists.\n\n"

They decide what the media is talking about, they hammer attack ad after attack ad into homes in swing-states, and its naive to think the average voter in middle America will be able to differentiate the slander from the facts.  \n\nThese are the guys who make your grandma think Obama is an anti-Christ, Muslim socialist, who wasn't born here.  They also influence how the politicians they support vote, which ends up giving them (in addition to laws that help them get richer) the ability to make donations through loopholes and manipulate the democratic process.

aS'To be fair, while they both are goons for billionaires currently it does not mean they are the same. Believe me, I\'m disappointed and saddened by what Obama has done, but did my vote not matter? It definitely mattered. Imagine if Romney was president, things would definitely be different. The federal government would likely be cracking down harder on drugs than Obama, the US would likely be more involved militarily worldwide, no healthcare change, and there\'d likely be major further tax cuts on the rich. Obama could be just a start of things going slightly left/liberal again, it could go further if people MAKE it go further.\n\nAlso, the reason that the candidates suck in the first place, that this happens, is BECAUSE people don\'t go vote. Imagine if everyone in who was pro-legalization got out to their primaries and got out to their elections and voted, it\'d be legal quickly, but none of those people do. They all say "the establishment doesn\'t want it" while candidates who are campaigning for it cant get any votes. Florida is a great example: medical legalization *was on the fucking ballot* and guess what? No young people voted and it failed. This was something they could have directly changed without ANY representative interference, a direct people vote, and it failed because "my vote doesn\'t matter".\n\nThe problem is the people who are "disenchanted" do nothing to change things and don\'t even vote (the very bear minimum) and then complain things aren\'t different. Things won\'t be different unless you do something! And keep doing something! No candidates you like? Go campaign next time, tell everyone you know about it, donate money, vote in primaries, vote in local elections, etc. etc. \n\nIt\'s hard for me to see understand the people sitting on their hands yelling Hillary and [insert right wing] are the same when none of do them  *anything at all* to change that. \n\nAnd things don\'t always change quick. Sometimes you have to work to make things better that may not come to fruition for years. \n\nSo go vote at the very least. At the worst you can do the "lesser of two evils", at best you can begin a shifting towards the people you DO want in office, if not now, then at least later.'

aS"I would argue Obama getting elected was Christmas morning for the billionaires, because it meant Congressional Republicans could do *anything* and the uneducated racists would still vote for them.\n\nMr. Obama just didn't seem to have the inclination nor the political wherewithal to bust heads (like an LBJ or FDR).

[Here\'s the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.\n\nThe following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:\n\n* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, \n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%\n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%\n\nNow, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):\n\n* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% \n\n* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   \n\n* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, \n\n* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%\n\nSo, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It\'s hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it\'s an insanely large difference.\n\nSecondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus "not-Hillary" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary\'s level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains "flat" she\'ll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). \n\nAdditionally, the "not Hillary / Bernie" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she\'s included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She\'s [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). \n\nIf I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the \'08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially "Warren Lite". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.\n\nSo where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)\n\n-----------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama "only" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she\'s doing a better job positioning herself as the "populist" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn\'t chip away at her initial polling numbers.\n\n[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]\n\n-------------\n\na shorter tl;dr: he\'s not in good shape right now...'

aS'&gt; The 10 year old comment as well as the PHL 101 comment were clearly intended to attack my intelligence. You can deny it because it makes you look bad but we both know that\'s what you meant to do.\n\nOr maybe its just you being overly sensitive? Lol, it doesn\'t make me look bad - it just makes you look weak and petty.  Bringing up logical definitions, Pointing out ad hominem, linking it to Wikipedia? It makes you look weak and desperate. Who does that except someone who is desperate? Or someone who has just discovered debating from PHL 101?\n\nIt just reeks of desperation. And yes my links in my last post was an artful way of mocking you. Perhaps you can see how ridiculous it looks.\n\n&gt;I am arguing that it is "conservative" because it has been supported by supposedly "conservative" politicians.\n\nAnd I am telling you that those politicians you mentioned are not considered to be Conservative based on popular opinion. Go on r/conservative and make a fake post about how Nixon is great. You are going to get a lackluster response. Actually, you\'re probably going to get alot of people comparing to him to Obama and how Obama makes him look like a choir boy. \n\n&gt;Authoritarianism is not a "conservative" principle. It has however been a tactic used by both "conservative" and "liberal" politicians, as I have defined above.\n\nActually, as I have defined, but OK, if it makes you feel better and save face\n\n&gt; No politician has held 100% "conservative" principles. If you are going to argue with people every time they use that that label you are going to waste a lot of your time.\n\nI have a better idea - you could not associate Conservatism with Authoritarianism. In fact, what you could do is **don\'t let politicians represent philosophies.** There, problem solved. '

aS"They vote when people talk about their issues. Obama won in 2008 because of the youth vote by discussion youth issues. If they're constantly ignored, why should they come out for candidates? Clinton will lose the general election without them so she had better start kissing some ass if she wants them to turn out. "

aS"He is focused on the billionaires that send jobs overseas to China and then pay their American workers minimum wage and less than 40 hours a week so that they can't have health insurance. That right there is the biggest reason we have so many people on welfare and why Obama enacted the ACA. Bring the jobs back, make education cheaper, make billionaires and corporations pay taxes, remove the cap on social security, give min. wage a little bump and you got yourself a plan for a prosperous America."
p693
aS'You are either forgetting or deliberately leaving out the fact that Obama declared in February of 2007, almost a full 3 months before Bernie has now. To accurately compare, pre-announcement Obama was polling at 10-15%. This is only a 4-10 points higher, not the 15-25 points higher as you are suggesting.'

aS'Obama did 9/11'
p695
aS'Your previous post shows that you went from being naive about how the political process works to a realist. No one gets 100% of what they want, this is why Sanders is loved here as he tosses out great black or white soundbites, yet they have no chance in reality, just like his chances of getting elected.\n\nYou should still vote but realize the US system is set up this way to prevent any one person from drastically altering the country. Thus change is slow and takes time. Obama has gotten a lot of good accomplished during his time in office so far, just not the naive sweeping change you think is actually possible by one administration in a small amount of time.'

aS'&gt; She\'s also pro-TPP, pro-NSA and generally a bit of a hawk.\n\nRight now, many of our eastern trading partners aren\'t bound by any kind of reciprocal trade agreement.  That leaves some rather gaping loopholes in trade law.  TPP is intended to close those loopholes.  If you don\'t understand why TPP is so popular among both Democrats and Republicans, getting angry at Hillary for supporting trade reform makes little sense.\n\nI\'m not sure what "pro-NSA" is supposed to mean.  Hillary backed Mark Udall\'s campaign for NSA reform back in 2014, before Udall was ousted from his Colorado Senate seat and replaced with a pro-NSA Republican.\n\nAnd Hillary loves to play tough on national defense, because she thinks it plays well with older voters (pro-tip: it actually does).  It\'s a weakness that sank her \'08 campaign.  I\'m still waiting to see what her \'16 platform is going to be on defense, but if it\'s anything like her husband\'s, it\'ll involve big defense budget cuts and liberal reforms of military policy.\n\n&gt; Then there are issues like campaign finance reform and wall street reform that Clinton claims to be for while taking money from interests that oppose those policies.\n\nObama claimed to be for them, and backed a number of bills - most prominently, the DISCLOSE Act of 2010.  Obama also took money from wealthy interests.  The DISCLOSE Act failed in a party-line vote to end the Republican filibuster.  Should we conclude that Obama opposed finance reform?'
p699
aS'Unfortunately, that\'s how you win a debate in our current political climate.  Being right or wrong with regard to facts and figures isn\'t as important any more.  What\'s important is making sure your message is heard, and your opponents is not.  \n\nIn my experience, the population is less and less likely to research facts and figures on their own, so if you can ramble off a bunch of talking points quickly and loudly, and stop your opponent from doing the same, those are the facts the population is going to have to draw from.\n\nEven in this video, it\'s plain to see that Bachmann is dedicated to sticking to the "talking points."  Obama created an economic downturn and we\'re losing jobs, increasing corporate wealth will create jobs, raising the minimum wage will mean lost jobs, etc.  She never directly responds to a question, never gives her opponent a chance to respond.  Just keep to the talking points, and don\'t let the other guy get a word in.  Even her comments that are demonstrably false--the American education system being of a high quality, for example--go by almost unnoticed, because no one has a chance to speak, or provide her with proof that she\'s wrong.\n\nStick to the talking points.  Don\'t let your opponent speak.  Make sure everyone knows your ideas are good, and your opponents are bad.  Win.'

aS"Obama had a Beer Summit so Bernie is going for Beerfest?  That's a showdown I want to see!"
p701
aS"You should. You're in a very politically enviable, valuable position, where the opinions of you and the rest of your state actually *matter* in the primary. Candidates spend *weeks* courting Iowan voters, eating your god-awful fried butter sticks and going to your corn festivals, and the media shines a goddamn magnifying glass onto Iowa during your primary. Your concerns are discussed, and candidates at least pretend to give a shit. You have the national stage and set the tone for the early primary season.\n\nThis is far, far more than what someone in California or New York would get. California and New York are taken for granted and are simply expected to vote for whoever rises to the top of the shit-heap. We're lucky if a candidate bothers to *stop by* during our primaries, let alone bother visiting a less-important part of the state. \n\nI think the last time a candidate stopped by in California was Bill Clinton in the 90's. Michelle Obama gave a speech in Merced, once. . .that's about it. This is in a state that has 11% of the US population and a similar percentage of the US economy in terms of GDP. We're an *actual* microcosm for the nation, our opinions should fucking *matter*, but we're ignored in favor of the states that get to be in the first 10 of the primaries.\n\n/rant"
p702
aS"i've always thought this too. In fact, to me Obama proved it. He has accomplished some, but he really  sounds/acts like a different guy than he did leading up to 08. I voted for him - and actually his presidency has taken the most wind out of my sail, even more than Bush; because I feel it supports the spirit of the bill hicks quote above."

aS"&gt;Only after she supported building a border fence\n\nA lot of progressives have long been in favor of some kind of compromise where in exchange for increased border security, illegal immigrants already here get legal status and some kind of path to citizenship.    Obama supported something similar.\n\nI think a border wall is stupid and pointless, but if they could have struck a compromise like that, it would have been worth it.\n\n&gt;While having JP Morgan, Lehman bros, and GS as her top donors.\n\nYou have to keep in mind, the politicians who eventually fix the whole campaign finance system reform will almost certanly be politicians who raised a hell of a lot of money to get into office in the first place.  That's just how it works; you always have to work through the system as it currently exists to try to reform it.\n\n&gt; Without anything more specific nowadays, it's lip service. \n\nHer record on economic issues in general is pretty progressive.   Voting against the Bush tax cuts for the rich, her push for universal health care in the 1990's.\n\nI certanly get that she's not as far left as Bernie Sanders, but overall the positions she's taken so far look pretty good."
p704
aS'And thinking back to that time, Obama seemed to come out of NOWHERE in the Primaries. I may not be remembering all that well because I was 14 in 2007, but to me it seemed like the tides turned pretty quickly towards Obama.'
p705
aS'Obama turned out to be a huge disappointment on so many levels. He campaigned on how bad NCLB was and has only made it worse as one example. And the Democratic Senate let everyone down too. But while they were sucking the other party was actively working against America. Flat out refusing to do the simplest things. Only one party was filibustering every appointment. '

aS'Despite what this website and the right wing have fed folks, Obama was and still is a liberal and a progressive.'
p707
aS"Obama doesn't refer to himself as a socialist. That's the clear and present difference between him and Bernie. And if the ACA is only glaring example of him being a socialist, then he is not a socialist. This new trade agreement, his Wall Street bailout, the use of drone warfare, his stance on privacy and Edward Snowden, the fact that Guantanamo is still open, and his inaction on many social issues like LGBT rights and mass incarceration all tell me he's not a socialist. Some of those things may or may not fall under a typical socialist agenda, but you get what I'm saying. "
p708
aS'How about trying the guy for torturing people? Contrary to what the article *incorrectly* states, torture *does not* have a statue of limitations. \n\nIn fact, it\'s an international crime and there is no recognized excuse for it, period - not war time, not "emergency", nothing. It\'s also highly illegal to aid torturers (say by refusing to prosecute their crimes, ala Obama for Bush and Cheney).'
p709
aS'As much as its fun to see a heckler put in his place, it also wasn\'t the best way for Bernie to handle it. Yelling "shut up" is not a good look. Look at the way Obama handled hecklers. He was perfect at that kind of stuff. He disarmed them with wit, he didn\'t get angry. That\'s how you do it. Bernie\'s probably going to get this a lot during the campaign going forward, and he better handle it better than he did here.'

Obama supported something similar.\nI think a border wall is stupid and pointless, but if they could have struck a compromise like that, it would have been worth it.\n\nI think it's fair if you personally agree with that.

That's just how it works; you always have to work through the system as it currently exists to try to reform it.\n\nI'm not necessarily as concerned about the amount of money, as I am where it's coming from. There are plenty of politicians that get less of their money from the financial sector. Even though I think he sold out to Wall Street pretty early on, Obama doesn't even get as much from financial sources. I think that by taking money from the banks really throws your message into shark infested water. You never get money from them, no strings attached.\n\n&gt;Her record on economic issues in general is pretty progressive. Voting against the Bush tax cuts for the rich, her push for universal health care in the 1990's.\n\nEh. She still had some conservative votes, like voting to limit capital gains taxes. Health care I get, but I'm not sure that's an economic issue. I mean on the other hand, she's pretty conservative in terms of free trade."

By all means, let's see what happens when Hillary rolls her Third Way Democrat agenda out against Bernie's policy positions, assuming she has the courage to do so.  It's a safe bet she won't dare since she knows the Democratic base would abandon her candidacy.   Barack Obama beat her in 2008 with the very Progressive platform that Bernie is running on now.\n\n&gt;How do you think they took both the Senate and the House the past 5 years?\n\nRepublicans took Congress in the MIDTERM elections because the Democratic base was demoralized and disgusted by Barack Obama's abandonment of the Progressive platform he ran on and WON the Presidency with in 2008 ***and*** 2012.  Barack Obama didn't win the White House by running on the Third Way platform you favor.  By the way, Third Way Democrats lost most of their re-election bids since 2008, but Progressive Democrats kept their Congressional seats.  That's as damning as it gets for Third Way/Conservative Democrats.\n\nWait until the 2016 election rolls around and voter turnout swells again.

I think a Bernie Sanders Presidency could bring real progressive change to this country even with a Republican controlled congress. There are powers that the executive branch has but haven't been used by establishment democrats like Obama and Hilary that are funded by Wall Street. \n\n1.) The president has the power to break up big banks with out having to go through congress. He will need to go through the Supreme Court, but it is worth noting that it is speculated that 3 justices will be nominated by the next president so I think he could have the support.\n\n2.) The president has power over trade deals. Currently Obama is working on a free trade deal within the Pacific rim called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). The scary this about this is that no one is allowed to know what policies the TPP contains until after congress approves it, they aren't even allowed to read it before voting. Sanders is the only announce presidential potential that is against it and as president he wouldn't need congress to act, and it is worth noting that [Sanders largest donations vs Hilary's](http://i.imgur.com/GCOVi0J.png) is really just Union and labor groups vs Wall Street. So I think we should go with Bernie!\n\n "

There are definitely some right wingers round these parts playing agent provacateur. Not saying you\'re one, but it is happening. \n\nAnd by "putting up with this shit" you mean, getting good leadership that gets us some of what we want, then I will continue to put up with that shit. \n\n&gt; Our democrats here are like europe\'s ultra right.\n\nYes, more or less.

Obama\'s mistake was in reverting to right wing stupid between elections and calling that betrayal "centrist" as Third Way Democrats and insiders ALWAYS do. \n\nBoth parties are too far right on economic and fiscal policy positions to ever consider themselves centrist.

He's running to the left of Hillary, but despite complaints about her from the left, she still polls very well among liberal Democrats, meaning there's not much for Sanders to take. He's also not a Democrat, he's an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. He has little name-recognition, he's from a tiny state, and even if he won the Democratic nomination, which is never going to happen, he would lose to the Republican nominee in a landslide."

Rural counties are almost always the poorest counties and don't really represent the state.

They almost all have very rich neighborhoods and very poor (which skew the actual numbers).  They're schools are usually the worst in the state, have the highest teen pregnancy rates, high crime rates, high drop out rates, lots of homeless people etc.  These counties almost always vote democrat.  \n\n  In Texas, Dallas county has both some of the poorest communities AND some of the richest in the state.

If you dont get those higher taxes, will you give the govt extra money you think it should be getting from you? If you say Yes, you should go and get a Tshirt that says you give the govt more money than you legally owe. It will tell a lot about you.\n\nI am not interested in your semantics game, I pointed out how wrong you were when you made the original point against Hillary.

He\'s a smart guy as well, but knee-jerky, and very black and white on issues. There\'s no gray area, you\'re either a progressive commie bastard or not.\n\nHe\'s basically just a lost soul who latched onto something that feeds into his anger issues.

I didn\'t say Obama was an absolute fascist with no other characteristics.\n\nIt\'s just that he\'s hardly the transparent and honest president I had hoped he would be, giving far too much power to those who have already proven themselves unworthy over the powerless.   \n\nIf I had to do it over, I\'d still choose him over Romney or McCain, but the phrase, "damning with faint praise," comes to mind.  \n\nYour average cocaine dealer would make a better president than Romney.'

He kept touting his progressive nature during his primary race. In the General Election, you're right, he veered to the center to try for those votes. His governance was much more conservative than I am OK with. He was slightly to the left of Bill Clinton (himself a damned fine moderate Republican). \n\nYou're right about all the rest as well.\n\nWe've established that expecting to be able to work with a GOP dominated House is naive. The only way to get the right wingers to foam at the mouth harder than mentioning the name Obama is mentioning the name Clinton. \n\nI agree with Bernie that too big to fail is too big to exist. No one is above the law. \n\nDo you see Ms. Clinton being able to pull that off w/ her ties to Wall St.? I don't. \n\nIn my opinion, given that there is no working with the GOP congress, we need to beat them into submission. If they're going to snarl and fight all the way to the doom of humanity (through global climate change), then we need someone who is sincere, will wield that rhetorical truncheon w/ skill, and is really working for the people - not just the rich people.\n\nBetween the two of them, I don't think that Hillary is that candidate."

I worked for a democrat in 2009, trying to keep the momentum going. I heard so many variations of "oh, I already did my part, I volunteered for Obama!" that I wanted to throw my phone at the wall. People just stopped showing up, and if Bernie wins they will do the exact same thing.\n\nYou think the worst case scenario is Clinton, but my guess is that\'s because you\'re too young to remember Bush. I apologize if my assumption is wrong, but the way you\'re talking about Sanders reminds me that most young people on reddit weren\'t adults in 2008 when Obama was elected.

aS'Speaking as someone who knows many immigration lawyers, Obama has been a real asshole towards undocumented latinos.  He treats them like the disposable workforce corporate America craves.  Republicans want to be worse, but under Obama undocumented adults get sent back home for first time traffic violations in droves.  The often repeated lie that they only deport bad guys is not true in the least.  Our immigration system is dysfunctional by design with clear racism in making it impossible for latinos to come here or stay here through legal means.  Check out the doc http://www.120daysmovie.com/ to see an intimate portrayal of the reality.'

aS'Yup, from people who forget or were too young to know in the first place. Obama was a crazily inspirational candidate and *really* tried to go into "permanent campaign" mode right after the election, he turned his Obama for America campaign into Organizing for America in order to push his new policy agenda and got basically zero traction.\n\nHe was far more charismatic, had a more achievable platform, had more money, better organizers, and was part of a wave election that added massive majorities to both houses of the legislature. And the American public tuned out, and let a bunch of Republicans pissed off about modest healthcare reform take everything over.\n\nThis kind of "if we just elect this one guy everything will be amazing!" attitude is a huge part of the burnout, I think. It\'s dangerous precisely because it pisses people off when you don\'t get *immediate* results and turns them against you. It creates a goodwill "bubble" the same way the housing bubble got inflated, and the results are similar. I\'d rather not see it get inflated in the first place, and pursue a strategy that actually grinds out solid results over the long term.'

I'm not sure if we will ever truly recover from the damage Bush and Cheney did to our image, not in my lifetime.  They created a situation where we can wage war at any time for any reason, and Obama rubber-stamped it.  They're all traitors. "

aS"I can understand people with differing ideologies from mine who praise Obama for his social implementations.  I can understand people who credit Obama for the recent apparent resurgence of the economy.  I don't necessarily agree with them, but I can understand them.\n\nThis?  Praising Obama for his foreign policy is nonsensical.  The man has weakened the United States' international stance with nearly every decision he's made.  We can talk about the nuclear deal with Iran, in which we gave so much and got practically nothing in return--Iran is still enriching uranium as we speak.  We can talk about [the climate deal with China](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-the-climate-pact-swindle/2014/11/20/f78f6474-70e9-11e4-8808-afaa1e3a33ef_story.html), in which the US pledged to cut its emissions by 30% by 2025, and China promised only to *stop increasing* its emissions by *2030*.  We can talk about how Obama has been almost entirely silent on Russia's ongoing annexation of the Ukraine.\n\nYes, Obama pulled our troops out of Iraq like he promised.  But I think it's safe to say that any warm fuzzies that anybody feels over that were effectively quashed a few months later when we saw the newly formed void filled by the most crazed and dangerous--not to mention genocidal--terror group we have yet seen, which has even begun motivating acts of terror on our own soil as of a few days ago.\n\nShe also gives him credit for ordering the kill on Osama bin Laden, which is also fair.  But again, that credit evaporates when you remember the subsequent decision to release five of our highest-ranking enemy prisoners in exchange for one deserting piece of shit (because in case you hadn't heard, Bergdahl is officially being court-martialed for desertion, and the odds aren't good).\n\nAlso, Cuba?  The country is single-party communist, and among the absolute least free nations in the world.  Congratulations, we have now decided to re-open trade with and support a regime that continues to economically repress its people year after year, and stands for the exact *opposite* of American values.\n\nI repeat: you can make arguments for successes on other administrative fronts, but Obama's foreign policy actions have been disastrous on nearly every front."

aS"So, you are another one of those that refuse to acknowledge that one of the first things Obama did was put Bush's war on the books, like they should have been all along. That's okay, we don't need for you to acknowledge it. It is fact and there is proof.\n\n[Obama Bans Gimmicks, and Deficit Will Rise - 2/19/2009](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/us/politics/20budget.html?_r=0)\n\n&gt;WASHINGTON  For his first annual budget next week, President Obama has banned four accounting gimmicks that President George W. Bush used to make deficit projections look smaller. The price of more honest bookkeeping: A budget that is $2.7 trillion deeper in the red over the next decade than it would otherwise appear, according to administration officials."

aS"The hope and change never materialized because, at the end of the day, Obama turned out to be repaying the favors of his wealthy donors on some issues, and got shafted on the rest by an uncooperative legislature.  Obama's biggest mistake after getting into office was to ignore the people who elected him; not by ignoring their issues, but by ceasing to truly engage the population politically and keep them conscious and active.  People just need to come together.  They need to regurgitate the false liberalism being shoved down their throats in the form of Empress Hillary and demand that their politicians represent them, and actually vote them the fuck out when they don't.\n\nYou talk about the political reality of Bernie's defeat like some sort of sportscaster predicting the superbowl.  Here's the overall reality, as I'm sure you've heard before:  The vast, vast, vast majority of people in this country are getting screwed over, in no uncertain terms, by a political system that is being influenced most heavily by wealthy individuals and corporations.\n\nI, my generation, and this country no longer have the luxury of being able to simply be disgruntled about these issues.  Jobs and wages are an issue for the people of this country, now.  Getting educated is an issue.  Getting healthcare is an issue.  Climate change will displace populations, strain resources and pose a real threat regardless of whether American policymakers accept the reality of it.  All these things are issues.  NOW.\n\nWe all know Hillary isn't sincere.  We all know that any politician that is taking campaign money from a bank, insurance company, law firm, large corporation ect. is not out for the best interest of the American people.  I'm not stupid, and I understand that Hillary would be better than a Republican, so I'll vote for her in the general election if she manages to convince a majority of democrats that deriving her campaign contributions from billionaires isn't a conflict of interest.  But I'm graduating college in 2017, and if Bernie doesn't get elected, I'll take my engineering education to Europe or Asia (and that's not being idealistic; I've lived on both continents already).  Not because I think the US is going to devolve into anything nasty in a flash, but because it will truly cement in my mind that, even with facts and the knowledge they aren't alone in their thinking, Americans don't have the courage to stand up and stand together.\n\nI don't want to leave this country, the greatest country in the history of the world.  For the next year, and maybe more, I will do everything in my power to get this man elected.  People know what needs to happen in this country.  Even you seem to know what needs to happen.  Honestly, I think everyone writing off Bernie as some college kid's fantasy is really just scared shitless that people are waking the fuck up."

Like 100% no overtime for part time employees.  Sure it could be that employers took the initiative and used something to squeeze a little more out of their employees.  But there was no protection from that either.  We weren\'t educated on the dangers of that and so we couldn\'t organize quickly.  Without executive analysis we were left with rumors.  And the "do you have a study showing that," mentality kept us from organizing.  Because no we didnt have a national study, just what was going on locally.  So we had to wait for studies in order to justify bargaining.  Neither happened.\n\nWhy Obama decided that health prospectors should get our money instead of it going directly to healthcare I will never know.  I wanted an easy single payer system.

When democrats were in power, they increased the food stamp budget and Obama increased it outside the budget via stimulus by billions. \n\nThe President doesn't control the budgetary process and there is no line item veto. Also the veto is a limited power as Congress can overturn it. \n\nThe problem is that you think the power of the budgetary committees in congress can simply be overridden by a one powerful person or a movement - things simply don't work that way. The moment you step out and protest against food stamp cuts, you will be labeled a lazy moocher by half the country who will ensure that your demands are ridiculed and ignored."
p814
aS"&gt; The last two Congresses kind of prove that point absolutely wrong.\n\nThe American people were unable to see where the blame lay and Obama is basically a nice guy and tried to work with them.  Clinton's style, however, proves that what the Republicans did this time doesn't always work."

But that's not a winning approach by itself."
p817
aS"First, I wouldn't know that because there were no reliable polls back then.\n\nSecondly, getting re-elected is not same as remaining popular or being approved for your work.

aS"&gt; Average unemployment rate during the Obama era: 8.1% From BLS data\n\nAlright, but how do you *interpret* that? Obama inherited high unemployment numbers, and those numbers have declined under his presidency. I'm not giving him sole credit for that, but it is disingenuous to attribute those initial high numbers to any actions taken by Obama.\n\nIn any case, we weren't talking about averages, we were talking about the April 2015 unemployment numbers. And those numbers are lower than the historical average unemployment rate."
p819
aS'Punching themselves in the face to hurt Obama is their entire Obamacare strategy...'
p820
aS'It is declining because as our population grows, very few jobs have been added. I believe Obama has added over 3 million jobs with a substantial price tag tied to them. Our last recovery which involved Reagan added over 15 million in less time. Our recovery is not as bright as people like it to be, but it is slowly growing. The problem comes when we try to consider the cost of the growth which is hard to do. Only time will tell us that.'

aS'1. Fair enough.\n\n2. It\'s my understanding that the definition of "unemployed" has gotten narrower over the years, so maybe prior administrations were using u6 and Obama is using u3? Don\'t know, just a guess. I DO KNOW that the current unemployment percentage DOES NOT take into account people who have stopped looking for work/given up, people who are UNDER employed, and people who have reached the end of their benefits. In short, it only takes into account people who receive unemployment benefits, which is a small number compared to those TRULY "without" a job.\n\n3. H1B is a HUGE problem. The cap last year was [65k](http://redbus2us.com/h1b-visa-2016/). Compared to 223k jobs added, at a maximum that\'s ~30% of new jobs. And, yes, it is important long term - I work in tech and can smell a bubble a mile away. It will burst, and take everyone - not just H1B workers - with it.\n\n4. ...'

aS'&gt;Yes a path to citizenship, everyone in America supports a path because almost everyone here comes from immigrants\n\nIt would be nice if that\'s true, but it\'s not.  Most Republicans have been blocking anything even remotely close to a path to citizenship, calling it "amnesty".\n\n\n&gt;She was against the Obama style plan originally (in 03) but now she wants to go even further. \n\nThat\'s not actually accurate.  Her position has always been roughly what Obama\'s position is; basically, give legal status and a path to citizenship to people who are already here, while also enforcing the border to stop more illegal immigrants from coming in.  That\'s the "grand bargin" Obama\'s been trying to get his entire administration, and that\'s the same thing she supported.\n\nSo, no, her position really hasn\'t changed.  Yes, she was in favor of a "border wall", and she was also in favor of a path to citizenship.  That\'s not a contradiction, it\'s basically the same compromise that Democrats in general have been pushing for for the last decade now.\n\nNow, personally, I think the whole "border wall" idea is stupid and pointless, a total waste of money and effort.   But that\'s really a different issue; the positions she\'s taken here are consistent and pretty common among progressives in politics.\n\n&gt;So yeah she is just pandering to votes. \n\nExcept, again, she\'s been totally consistent on pushing on this issue since the 1990\'s.   \n\n&gt; If they don\'t believe in what they say before the election how can you expect them to follow through when they are elected?\n\nI totally believe that she will try to push the country in a progressive direction if elected; she was a very liberal first lady, and a liberal senator with a liberal voting record, why wouldn\'t you think that?\n\nShe\'s not as far left as Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but I think she\'s totally serious on these issues.   Not only that, I think she won\'t make the mistake Obama did in his first term where he wasted too much time trying to make bipartisan compromises with a Republican party that had absolutely no interest in compromise; I think she\'ll hit the ground fighting hard for these issues from day 1.

Workers owning the means of production and directing it would create a way to change the system, I think.\n\n That's why leftist are cynical because the tide is so high and we're at our necks.

Even back when Bush was in office it was clear that the Pentagon was telling the White House that attacking Iran was a no-go. Since then the Iranian position has gotten stronger and the US\' weaker. At some point the military will force the government to stop engaging in losing wars because it\'s bankrupting and ruining the country. Of course, we could hope the American people do that, but we\'re too busy voting for our two war-loving parties for our bloodbaths to end without someone stepping up.\n\nAs for Syria, if you ask me it was likely the presence of Russian ships off the Syrian coast that would have directed Syrian anti-ship missiles to US ships, some strong words from Russia to the US (which we are paying back in Ukraine), and a face-saving "out" for the US provided by the Putin/Kerry chemical weapons deal that all combined to convince the US not to attack. So instead we\'re attacking by proxy by yet again arming Islamic fundamentalists.\n\n&gt; Massive military forces would still be in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nObama should get zero credit for our withdrawal from Iraq. Not only did Obama spend the summer and fall before the withdrawal trying to bribe and arm-twist the Iraqis into keeping troops in Iraq, but the timetable Obama left on was actually negotiated and set by the Bush administration.\n\nAnd in Afghanistan, I\'ve lost count of how many times Obama has made promises to leave and then broke his promise. It\'s clear our evil government wants to turn Afghanistan into a full-fledged US vassal state. But Afghanis have a long, proud history of ejecting foreign invaders from their land, and all the signs point to the US losing yet another war there too.\n\nIn a year or three we\'ll "declare victory" and leave just like we have in every other losing war effort our empire engages in. We\'ll leave a devastated country and then our propaganda systems will start their revisionist history spinning of how our actions were "honorable" and that we meant well.\n\n&gt; The parties are not equal.\n\nYou\'re free to your own opinion, but other than differences in wedge issues and some other trivial positions, my opinion is that those differences are not worth someone\'s time identifying.'

aS"&gt;A lot of dems feel the same way about Clinton right now, but I doubt they wouldn't vote D come election day.\n\nRespectfully, that confidence is misplaced because Democratic voters didn't show up to vote in either of the midterm elections after President Obama demoralized them with Conservative/Third Way Democrat policy positions which he didn't run on in the general elections.  Even more telling, Third Way Democrats lost their re-election bids while Progressive Democrats held their seats.\n\nHilary Clinton is a Conservative/Third Way Democrat who is unlikely to champion the Progressive policy agenda this country desperately needs.  This is not lost on the Democratic base.  As such, she is unlikely to turn out the Democratic vote either as long as she adheres to those policy positions both before and after the election.\n\nOne final point, it appears that the Clinton camp assumes that if they don't make any meaningful Progressive commitments during the campaign that they can evade their fiduciary duties to this nation and the Democratic base.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Assuming Hillary is elected, she has two Presidential paths before her...the one blazed by Herbert Hoover (aka the Third Way Democrat path) or FDR (aka the reform-minded Progressive path).  History already tells us which one is the wiser path to take, but that choice will be up to her.  Ultimately, she'll be the one to suffer or benefit from that choice in this nation's annals of history.  Barack Obama made the wrong choice by siding with Wall Street over Main Street.  "

aS"&gt; So, yeah. Warrantless wiretaps?\n\nAgreed, my biggest disappointment with the Obama admin.\n\n&gt; Guantanamo?\n\nNot entirely in his control. He ordered the CIA to shut it down as one of the first things he did when in office. Unfortunately there's that tricky bit about what to do with the prisoners and congress historically had laws regulating the release of said prisoners. Those regulations have softened recently, but there is still a question about what to do with the prisoners.\n\n&gt; Banks?\n\nObama had a choice during the height of the recession, throw all effort into pulling the economy out of its free fall or endeavor to bring some individuals to justice. There may not have been enough political will to do both, and the support (or lack of efforts to undermine) of wall street and the like was important to achieving some pretty critical successes in that battle.\n\nHe made his choice, and you can criticize it certainly, but I don't see how this choice makes him equivalent to a Republican.\n\n&gt; Dual standards of justice?\n\nWhat's this one about?\n\n&gt;  Both parties. No difference.\n\nExcept for the the full blown invasion of two nations, fabrication of the threat of WMD's, starve the beast economic strategies, abortion and gay marriage stances, green energy policies and emissions policies, yeah I agree there is __no difference__."

We put some into Libya and Egypt for some good measure. We would have been in Syria, too, if Russia hadn\'t called our bluff.\n\nMore importantly, these are all small pieces to a larger theme that both parties espouse. Want to see an interesting debate? Ralph Nader and Ron Paul in 2012. Totally different candidates, but they both want peace. Civil liberties. Sane fiscal policy. Both have totally different ideas about how to get there, but both are ignored on the merits.\n\nImagine a world where the trillions we spend bailing out banks and blowing people up would have gone to housing. Roads. Schools. Internet infrastructure. Healthcare. Medical research. Renewable energy. Or, if you prefer, let everyone keep that money in some sort of lowtax Libertarian utopia. It\'s not a pipe dream! But the current set of mouthpieces for the parties - I\'m not talking the Donna Edwards of the parties now, but the ones bankrolled by huge special interests that end up on committees - offer us more and more of the same.\n\nKruschev said our country was run by two factions of rich people that opposed each other, but would always band together against the worker.

Why a little over 5-6 months ago, this President eagerly signed a [budget bill which financial industry lobbyists used to roll back a major derivative rule](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/spending-bill-992-derivatives-citigroup-lobbyists), effectively gutting a key provision of Dodd-Frank in the process.  Not only did this President fight against common sense and Democrats to pass it, he enlisted JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon\'s help in twisting Congressional Democrat\'s arms to go along.  Was that an example of the common sense "logic" and responsibility you are referring to here, Mr. President?  Seriously?   \n\nWe couldn\'t agree more that people should judge the President\'s record when it comes to making responsible economic decisions.  Unfortunately, that record proves that he isn\'t as far from being Reaganomic stupid as he should have been throughout both terms.   That\'s why the country\'s middle class has not recovered, his political support among Democrats has vaporized and the Democratic base\'s trust in his leadership was lost in the first term.'

aS'The GOP is simply a far better political party than the Democrats.  To be clear on what I mean, here\'s a definition:\n\n&gt;A political party is an organization of people which seeks to achieve goals common to its members through the acquisition and exercise of political power.\n\nThe GOP is among the best in the world at the game of politics, the Democrats average at best.  They use every tactic available, gain every little advantage.  They are better at fundraising, better at focusing their base, better at pushing as a unified front.  \n\nBut what they are really good, better perhaps than any political movement in modern history, is pushing fear.  They\'ve learned that fear is the secret to a unified political base, a way of forcing social conservatives to hold hands with financial conservatives that come from entirely different backgrounds.\n\nExamples?  /r/conservative.  Breaking down their top posts (note, this is general.  I\'m mainly noting the fact that they AREN\'T talking policy issues, but rather pushing tension):\n\n* Fear of blacks\n* Fear of blacks\n* Fear of Mexicans\n* Fear of blacks and Mexicans\n* Fear of big government\n* Fear of Mexicans\n* Nothing\n* Fear of Mexicans\n* Fear of liberal media\n* &amp;c., with some fear of Muslims thrown in\n\nAlmost every post is designed to create tension towards an out-group.  You\'ll see very similar things at /r/republican, or even non-US conservative subreddits like /r/tory, albeit with different out-groups.  \n\nThe constant usage of fear acts as a massive directing force for the Republican party, and the same tactics have been used for massive conservative shifts in almost all the English speaking countries (Canada, the UK, and Australia have all shifted heavily towards the right).  \n\nFear is so useful to a political party because it lowers critical thinking and dissension. Republicans aren\'t less intelligent than Democrats, but they have to deal with far more fear-pushing bullshit.  How can a person vote in their own best interest if they have fear clouding their judgement?  \n\nLiberal groups try to use fear in similar ways, but they fail because their out-groups are more abstract.  Because their base is more varied, they don\'t have convenient scapegoats like conservative groups have.  Compare "the rich" versus "Muslims."  Which is easier to picture?  Which is easier to to use as a boogeyman?  \n\nThe great thing about the Republican tactics is that they feed into themselves.  They push conspiracies to create fear, and that fear lowers critical thinking and makes it easier to push other conspiracies.  This is why they make everything into a conspiracy.  Climate change isn\'t just wrong, it is a global liberal conspiracy.  Hillary and Obama aren\'t just bad politicians, they are involved with scores of conspiracies.  \n\nTL;DR:  Most of your rant comes down to the fact that a political party\'s goal is not to improve the country, but to win elections.  The Republicans are far better at winning elections, motivating their base with fear while the Democrats struggle with voter apathy because they can\'t use the same tactic nearly as well.  '

aS"The math here is simple.  Forget everything you think you know about America.  Now imagine a country whose president doesn't take bribes in office but does have the potential to get paid 100s of millions of dollars from mega corporations through their foundations once he leaves office.  Half a million for each 1 hour speach.  Think NAFTA and Bill Clinton.  Now imagine a president not getting 100s of millions but just a couple million as a former world leader because he didn't try his best to please mega corporations in office, say Jimmy Carter.  \n\nThat is the reason Obama is doing what he is doing now, even without his own party supporting him.  He could lose 100s of millions in his pocket if he doesn't do all he can to get TPP passed, and listened to his own values.  This is about the Obama family becoming part of the powerful ultra rich elite class that controlled his presidency and the country, so his descendants can hold the strings instead of being controlled by them.  Obama used to think he was a person who put values first, but he had an ugly wake up call about what America truly is.

aS"&gt;when republican policies pushed us to the brink of another depression?\n\nThey were Democratic policies too. I know that's easy to forget.\n\n&gt;How are we so mad at Obama\n\nNow I need to vent. Obama had a super majority in Congress when he first came into office, and rather than using his majority to pass a higher minimum wage, reform banking in a meaningful way, raise taxes on the 1% or pursue green energy policy he decided to pass his legacy and force the ACA through a Democratic Congress. A law that gives huge handouts to the country's wealthiest corporations. He also raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than any other president and has deported more immigrants.\n\nThat's not all. Obama expanded America's foreign policy, drone use and military spending, while doubling down on the domestic spying he promised to eliminate. He also pushes secret trade deals that will continue to benefit the top 1% at the expense of everyone else.\n\nDespite all of this, people continue to support him because he talks a big game. He says the things we all want to hear knowing he can't follow through on it, or purposefully does the opposite. But the Republicans are worse right? They're the ones responsible for running once prosperous cities into the ground from decades worth of poor policies. No, wait, that was what the Democrats did to Detroit. Democrats, despite their policies of good intentions, slowly killed one of America's greatest cities. \n\nAre Republicans constructive to America? No, I don't believe so, but pretending Democrats are the change America needs is laughably naive."

He refused to go after cheney &amp; bush for the war crimes they admitted to committing (of course he is doing the same thing). He\'s all about illegal surveillance &amp; the TPP. Hell, even his "signature legislation" is a conservative idea. What has Obama done that is uniquely liberal? Yet, the man gets blamed every time it rains. Where is all of the hate coming from.

If corporations benefit and citizens do too, no reason to complain.\n\n&gt; He also raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than any other president\n\nFirst of all, more medical marijuana dispensaries have been created during his presidency.  There are 23 states plus DC that have legalized medical marijuana.  In 2008, there were only 13 states.  You are manipulating raw data to support this absolute bullshit point.\n\n&gt; has deported more immigrants\n\nNow this is clearly a soundbite from some shitty news source.  Do you know that the term "deportation" hasn\'t officially been used since the 90s?  Reports have combined the number of those deported from the country and the number of those prevented from entering the US to form the new official term: Removal.  I can\'t actually address the deportation statistics because they haven\'t existed for nearly 20 years.  ICE has recently started to put out its deportation and exclusion figures because the media has been misrepresenting their reports for a long period of time.\n\nOn a statistical basis, I can tell you that you are once again repeating some stupid ass soundbite that misrepresents the data.  Yes, by a pure numbers perspective, we can assume that the agencies who can remove illegal immigrants have done so to more people under Obama than his predecessors.  With that being said, the number of expulsions since 2009 has fallen by 40%.\n\n&gt; Obama expanded America\'s foreign policy, drone use and military spending\n\nNo shit he expanded our foreign policy.  Our foreign policy under Bush was to be friends with those who can give us stuff and bomb the fuck out of those we disagree with.  Expanding our foreign policy is very, very, very important in such a globalized economy/society.  Maybe we should treat other countries with respect.  With more connections, treaties, and partnerships in place, we can grow to be greater.\n\n&gt; drone use\n\nInstead of throwing troops at our problem.  I see Bush as a small scale version of Stalin.  Got a problem?  Just throw people at the problem until it goes away.  Obama brought lots of troops back and started using drones instead.  That, to me, is fantastic.\n\n&gt; military spending\n\nOne of the largest costs we have that is under military spending is paying down all of the debt that the two fucking bullshit wars in the Middle East caused.  \n\nOn another note, the Congressional Budget Office said that military spending from 2000 to 2009 increased at an average rate of 9% per year.  Since 2011, we have generally seen a steady decline in defense spending.  So I don\'t know what the hell you are talking about when you say Obama expanded military spending.\n\n&gt; while doubling down on the domestic spying he promised to eliminate\n\nDoubling down?  Really?  Ever heard of the Five Eyes?  It was a group of five countries (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and UK) who decided to divide the world up into groups and have each Eye spy on a different group.\n\n* US spied on Middle East, China, Russia, Caribbean, and Africa\n* Canada spied on Russia, China, and Latin America\n* Australia spied on South and East Asia\n* New Zealand spied on Southeast Asia and Western Pacific\n* UK spied on Europe, European Russia, Middle East, and Hong Kong\n\nThey divided up the fucking world in 1946 to create spying assignments.  You think Obama has doubled down when the NSA looks at everything that enters or leaves the US?  You think Obama has doubled down by spying on allies and other countries?  He hasn\'t doubled down on anything.  The NSA was formed in 1952.  You think they haven\'t been changing what they look at over the decades?  You think the CIA and other intelligence agencies haven\'t been adapting to the tech age we live in until Obama stepped in?  That\'s absolutely laughable.  Forget about Snowden for a second.  There have been many people who work at the NSA who leak shit, and they date back to the early 2000s.  This has all been going on for decades!\n\n&gt; He also pushes secret trade deals that will continue to benefit the top 1% at the expense of everyone else\n\nIf they are secret then how do you know who it will hurt and who it will benefit?  Maybe he just doesn\'t want Congress jumping down his back like what happened with Iran.  They almost ruined negotiations because they couldn\'t keep their mouths shut.  This deal will open the doors with a bunch of countries that our businesses have not really reached out to yet.  The countries involved are: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.  Saying that the trade deals will benefit the top 1% is like saying a corporation becoming a Fortune 500 company benefits those who hold the largest portions of stock.  Well no shit, Sherlock.\n\nCompanies will be expanding into new markets and that will certainly allow the 1% to bring home larger paychecks, but it also will lower costs to the rest of us.  If a company is producing a metric fuckton more of a product, it will be cheaper as they are moving more of the product for a cheaper price.  That\'s how Capitalism works (in an oversimplified way).\n\n&gt; people continue to support him because he talks a big game\n\nActually, he doesn\'t.  The one thing I hate about Obama is that he isn\'t and will never be the kind of \'in your face\' guy we see in leaders around the world.  With that being said, it\'s his level headedness that I love about him.  He never acts with aggression.  He always faces a problem and tries to find a solution before acting.\n\n&gt; He says the things we all want to hear knowing he can\'t follow through on it, or purposefully does the opposite\n\nWelcome to politics.  Plan for the worst, and hope for the best.  Quit complaining.\n\n&gt; No, wait, that was what the Democrats did to Detroit\n\nNow that is a whole different can of worms.  Policy did not make Detroit fail.  There was an awful chain of events dating back to the 1950s that caused Detroit to fail.  If you want to open the can, I\'m prepared.\n\nAh, the good ol\' days in Detroit.  The car industry was booming and all of the car manufacturers needed more employees!  This was the 1950s, so WWII was over and there were a bunch of skilled metal workers.  The automotive industry of course boomed in Detroit, so that\'s where everyone went!  The city grew up to 1.8 million people in the 50s, making it the 5th largest city at the time (also would be 5th largest today).  \n\nAt the time, there was a man by the name of William Levitt.  He is considered the father of suburbia, known for mass producing housing developments at upwards of a new house every sixteen minutes.  Large suburbs started popping up everywhere around the country, including around Detroit.  Little by little, those living in Detroit started moving out to the suburbs.  Between 1950 and 1960, approximately 179,000 people moved out of Detroit into the suburbs.  In the 1960s, this trend continued at a rate of 10,000 people per year moving to the suburbs.\n\nSo now the year is 1967.  Lyndon B Johnson was our president, and we were fighting in Vietnam.  In Detroit, what happened in 1967 was a catalyst to white flight.  At this point in time, 12th Street was the place to be if you wanted nightlife.  On July 23, 1967 at 3:30am, police raided an illegal club that was operating out of a civil rights group\'s office.  That night, the club was holding a party for several veterans, including two hot off the plane back from Vietnam.  Police moved in and everyone at the party (85 in total) refused to leave.  \n\nNow, rumors had been spread around the area that the cops had shot and killed multiple black people in the few days leading up to this night, so tensions were high.  As the last person was taken away to be arrested, people started throwing bottles at the police, and a riot erupted.  This riot is still one of the worst in US history, with 43 people dying, 1,189 reported injuries, and over 7,000 arrests.  Governor George Romney sent in National Guardsmen and President Johnson sent in members of the military to put an end to the riot.\n\nAfter the riot, and as race tensions grew to very high levels, whites fled to the surrounding suburbs to find peace.  The population of Detroit in 1970 was now 1.5 million and declining.  At around the same time, auto manufacturers started building new plants elsewhere, and also started to import more vehicles.  The Detroit area now held a very small piece of the automotive industry.  Property values dropped, tax revenue dropped, violent crimes increased (especially murder), and those who could afford to move to the suburbs did so.  Detroit didn\'t have enough money to combat the crime in the 1970s, and they had no way to make any money.  No one wanted to move into Detroit.  It was just hell.\n\nThese trends continued even further, and Detroit\'s population was under 1 million in the 2000 census.  In 2013, they hit 688,000 people.\n\nSome things are out of the control of policies.  This spiral caused a major budget deficit, and ultimately lead to bankruptcy.  Right now, Mike Duggan, a Democrat, is turning the city around.  You will see great things in Detroit in the coming years.\n\n&gt; Democrats, despite their policies of good intentions, slowly killed one of America\'s greatest cities.\n\nOnce again, a bullshit media soundbite as I just proved above.\n\n&gt; Are Republicans constructive to America? No\n\nWell that\'s good.\n\n&gt; pretending Democrats are the change America needs is laughably naive.\n\nI don\'t think many people would agree that Democrats are the needed change, but we do need a government that is willing to help its citizens in a time of need.  At this point in time, that is the Democratic Party.'

In fact Obama's 'paltry' 7.3% margin in 2008 was the biggest margin in a presidential election since 1996 where Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole by 8.5 points and that's only because Ross Perot spilt the Conservative vote to the tune of 8.4 points.

It *does* allow the argument to continue to move up the chain and into the supremee court. Until the Supreme Court makes a decision, the president does *not* have the legal power to ignore the law.\n\nThis is why presidents can't just arbitrarily end laws they don't agree with. That's why they need either Congress or SCOTUS to either repeal it or declare it unconstitutional (respectively). Presidents have every right to think something is unconstitutional, but they do *not* have the legal authority to deem something constitutional or unconstitutional. It's also why federal laws don't get repealed just because a district court declares it unconstitutional - because district courts do *not* have that power.\n\n&gt;Try reading the constitution sometime.\n\nThe irony of this statement...\n\n&gt;The law wasn't in place. It had been struck down, as it was clearly unconstitutional.\n\nYes, it *was* in place. DOMA was in place since 1996 until it was finally declared unconstitutional by SCOTUS in 2013.

This is exactly why Third Way Democrats are no better than Republicans and equally as disastrous in the public sector.\n\nBarack Obama chose to pass this element of his legislative agenda toward the end of his second term since the Democratic base would have prevented him from seeing a second term if he had rolled this economic stupidity out in his first term.  Obama's pulling a Bill Clinton here since the worst legislative initiatives to come out of Bill (i.e., financial industry deregulation) were toward the end of his second term too.

Here is my response.  ...Holy Kat Krap Sylvia, I did read the ACA and did not get this interpretation. I'm pretty sure older people are going to pass away generally faster than young people, but I don't believe that equates to a plan to kill them all off. Here is an example that relates to your theory. In 1988, my father (a WWll vet) was very ill at the age of 64. He needed heart surgery and possibly a new heart. My mother was told that that he did not qualify for the surgery due to his age. The understanding was that younger candidates should benefit from such extreme measures. He died that year. Think this through. This was 1988, the doctors and hospitals are making these decisions (Barrack Obama is not a president, just a kid). Many, many people of advanced age have passed before and since then due to the beliefs and decisions of unknown doctors, hospital and insurance bureaucrats. The ACA law put into place revisions to the Health Care INSURANCE industry. It has resulted in multi millions more Americans  who now have Health Insurance they did not have before (and millions more could be insured if a number of states would expand Medicare) and multi millions of Americans who have BETTER AND MORE APPROPRIATE Health Insurance than they did before. It has resulted in multi millions of Americans who have AVOIDED DEATH  and/or painful misery because they get care through affordable Health Insurance.

And perhaps, the very best use of our tax dollars among all of the important expenditures."

aS'&gt; everyone else who is paying higher premiums and much higher deductibles\n\nAt the end of the day, either we all pay more in taxes to cover those without insurance, or we pay a little more insurance and less in taxes.  Obamacare is trying to shift these burdensome costs into the private sector, which is actually ideal.\n\n&gt; I\'m not manipulating anything. The number of raids went up when they should have been going down. It\'s not "okay" because the number of dispensaries went up too. You\'re saying he\'s allowed to raid them because there were more of them. I don\'t understand that.\n\nLets take two scenarios:\n\n* Scenario A: There are 100 marijuana dispensaries, and 20 of them are raided by police\n* Scenario B: There are 1,000 marijuana dispensaries, and 21 of them are raided by police\n\nScenario A is worst because that means 20% of the dispensaries were raided.  In the case of Scenario B, there were still 979 (97.9%) dispensaries that were not raided.  Police raiding 20% of the stores is much worse than police raiding 2.1% of the stores, yet you are saying Scenario B is worse because they raided one more store.  There are many more places to go in Scenario B, and although I think the raids should stop altogether, I would prefer the police raid at the lower rate of stores.\n\n&gt; Instead we have more instability in the Middle East\n\nThe Middle East hasn\'t been stable since before imperialism in the area.  I don\'t know how long you have been watching the Middle East, but Syria has been getting progressively worse for the past 10 years, Iran has been getting worse since the new regime was put in after our failed attempt with the Shah, Iraq has been in shambles for a long time, Afghanistan has been run with terrorists since we gave them guns to fight the Soviets, etc.  The majority of the instability in the Middle East was either caused by imperialism or containment.  Nothing is more unstable now than it was before Obama, just now we have more technology to show us the battlefields easily.\n\n&gt; and the US is involved in more conflicts than when Bush was in office\n\nThe only way this statement is true is if you include conflicts in which we are helping to arbitrate.  We have fewer troops on battlefields than under Bush, and that is what I find most important.  Too many soldiers and civilians have felt the wrath of what war is truly like through injury or death to themselves or each other, and it\'s awful.\n\n&gt; Troops don\'t bomb weddings and create massive collateral damage.\n\nDrones don\'t get blown into pieces by IEDs.  Drones don\'t have to watch one of their brothers die from gun fire, and worry about taking the body back for a proper burial.  Drones don\'t have to worry about insurgents that strap bombs to their vehicles and drive towards the drone\'s company.  Drones don\'t get mental illnesses.  \n\nDrones don\'t have families who sit at home hoping they don\'t get a knock on the door to give them bad news.\n\n&gt; That was a really long, irrelevant post about nothing. Doubling down is a semantic term that you seemed to take too literally. The point was Obama has pushed for NSA spying and eroding the 4th amendment.\n\nI don\'t agree with what the NSA is doing, but it\'s absolutely Constitutional.  The recent court ruling from that federal court was one of the shittiest rulings I\'ve ever read.  They were clearly digging to find something to be the grounds for their decision.  The NSA tracks anything going in or out of the US, meaning it crosses national boundaries.  By international law, they are allowed to do that.  There is no 4th amendment for when data passes over national boundaries.\n\nEven if the information stays in the US, it uses government owned infrastructure which is where the track everything.  They are not acting with disregard for the Constitution.  That being said, I hope Congress can legislate away the powers they gave them.\n\nAs for the Five Eyes, that was the way the US spied on everyone, internationally and domestically.  My point was that they\'ve been doing all of this for a while now.\n\n&gt; Why are they secret? Obama has said that if people knew what was in the deal the public wouldn\'t support it. It looks like you are immediately supporting Obama despite not knowing anything about his TPP.\n\nDon\'t ever try and tell me what it looks like I\'m doing, because you will be wrong 999,999 out of a million.  First of all, I think Obama is right in his comment that the public wouldn\'t support it.  Then again, our country is dumb enough to try and become fucking Christian, yet complain about the countries run be religion in the Middle East.  We can\'t even let gay people marry in every state yet.  We, collectively speaking, are fucking stupid.  I wouldn\'t trust this stupid ass nation to remember the names of all 50 states or even our national anthem.  \n\nAlso, there is a very good reason to trust the TPP.  Canada and Japan are two very close allies.  They have no reason to fuck us over, and we have no reason to fuck them over.  We all protect each other in negotiations, and I expect no difference now.  At the end of the day, I don\'t think the US, Canada, or even Mexico goes in without each other.\n\nIf the negotiations had only the US negotiating in favor of North America, I would be worried.  The fact that there are other countries we are very good friends with who have spoken positively about the TPP provides me the evidence I desire to feel good about the deal.  I absolutely trust South Korea, Canada, the US, and Mexico to all look out for one another.  \n\nMy guess to why they are secret is that the countries are talking about lifting major trade sanctions and tariffs, which would cause hell, as seen after the Iran negotiations.\n\n&gt; So a crackdown on a club caused the downturn of Detroit? \n\nNo, but it was a catalyst to the white flight movement that lead to many leaving Detroit for its suburbs.  White flight, car manufacturers opening plants elsewhere, and the fact that the state of Michigan didn\'t help Detroit in a time of need caused the downturn of Detroit.\n\n&gt; You\'re sure it had nothing to do with unfunded liabilities and policies with unintended consequences?\n\nAbsolutely, 100%.  If you have any examples, though, I\'d love to hear them.\n\n&gt; Maybe it made more sense in your head.\n\nMaybe if you actually read what I wrote instead of skimming it, which you clearly did as per your previous two questions, it would make more sense to you.\n\n&gt; Well, apologists gonna apologize and this is a damn good apology.\n\nI\'m not an apologist.  That requires something to be controversial.  Maybe if you just stopped believing everything you have heard elsewhere and actually dug deeper into the points you try and bring up, you would understand how unfounded your claims truly are.\n\nThe fact that your response to me doesn\'t include any examples besides obamacare premiums and bombing weddings shows me that you actually have no idea what you are talking about, on a more detailed level.  I implore you to actually read up on the topics you bring up, and not through news sources.  News sources rarely bring in the historical similarities or key historical aspects that are important to actually understand these subjects.'

aS"I've not been around as long as McGovern and Mondale but I have been around for more than a few primary fights. The key aspect that people for sanders seem to keep forgetting is that party leadership makes a huge difference. There seems to be a misconception about Obama's run in 2008, he basically had a perfect storm of good speaking, surprise challenging, debate skills, and most importantly endorsements and even with all of this it was an incredibly close race. Obama began effectively courting super delegates in 2004 when he gave the keynote at the convention, from there he used Dick Durbin to establish connections within the party. Super delegates matter. A lot. They count towards overall delegate count and their endorsements can make or break a candidate. They campaign for you and usually have a following that brings votes, Obama actually beat Clinton in super delegates and that was a Huge determine factor of him winning. Sanders doesn't have any of that built in, he's from a small state with little connections, and has been running as an independent his whole life, sometimes even against democratic candidates. A lot of party faithful will be wary of that. \n\nI use Obama as the example because really there's hardly anyone to compare Hillary to, she's been so well established its crazy and just added Secretary of State to her resume and I think she's learned from her failed run in 2008. Plus She has the power of using one of the most popular figures in the party, if not the most popular figure in the party with bill Clinton. It puts her in a unique position. She's extremely well established, currently well liked in the party with a variety of experience and a huge secret weapon campaigning. Obama negating bill a little by getting maybe the most well liked woman in America on Oprah to campaign for him in 2008 in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Bernie doesn't really have that help, even the biggest name that would most likely agree with him, Elizabeth Warren, seems to be tepidly supporting Clinton probably looking to run in 4-8 years herself. Now Maybe you could argue Robert Kennedy in 1968 challenging the sitting Vice President but he had the Kennedy name and even before the assassination he was trailing and likely to never catch him in delegates. \n\nOverall I think it's great a lot of people are excited about sanders but party politics is tough, and the general can be even harder. I don't see Obama's unlikely win in sanders. He has a lot of things working against him and a lot of problems in terms of electability to compound those problems. There have been similar candidates (kuchinic, I know people hate the comparison but Ron Paul for the republicans, etc) and they have faced the same hurdles in the past without much result, I'm not optimistic about his chances but everyone has the right to campaign and donate and speak in favor of a candidate I just hope people take a step back and be realistic about the situation. If they end up disengaged because Clinton wins or wins big I am afraid of the progressive base of the party not showing up to vote as is needed in the general. There seems to be a resentment about her, which granted I know for progressives she's hardly a perfect candidate but she's also a lot better than a republican. Having a republican president could be disastrous for the Supreme Court. There are currently about 4 justices at or approaching retirement age. Ginsberg, Kennedy, Breyer and Scalia. Two of those are liberals, one is a swing vote and one is a conservative. If any one of the first three leave with a republican president then the court shifts from a split court like we currently have to a solidly conservative court, and the other justices are young in comparison. It's really something that could affect the laws of this country for decades. It's what concerns me the most. "

aS"&gt; Then Mr Obama needs to release the entirety of the text of the trade deal so that we, the American People can pass judgement on it ourselves.\n\nIt will come out eventually of course. Until then, Liz Warren or anyone else who hasn't read it making claims about it is kind of silly. As said elsewhere in this thread, criticize it for lack of transparency (though there are arguably some reasons that make sense to do it that way), but don't make claims about what is in it when you don't know. You just look silly. \n\n&gt; The only reason to keep it a secret from us is if you already know we will disapprove\n\nThat isn't actually true. The trade deal has many parties. Negotiating all aspects of it in full view could have worldwide reactions to something that never even gets close to being in a final draft. So there are potential reasons for negotiating the deal confidentially. "

Not just in the US, but all around the world, conservatives are winning. From Great Britain, Israel, Brazil, Finland, and the US, progressives are being decimated worldwide.'

I'm liberal too, but I think there are a lot of people that are more aligned with this side of the political spectrum because of it's social connotation. They're doing it because it's cool, not because they really understand the issues. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'd rather have people be right for the wrong reasons than be wrong, but it concerns me because that means when something that's wrong gets popular traction, they'll continue chasing that aspect of it. \n\nHe's right. Just because Elizabeth warren is saying exactly what the reddit hive mind wants to hear, that doesn't mean she's not a politician, trying to make a name for herself. She can say stuff like this without it actually effecting policy, with no political risk to boot. \n\nI like her too, but I don't understand how reddit as a  whole isn't aware that there's a difference between ideology and reality, which is why Obama gets criticism here for things he has no power over.

It was a massive undertaking ON TOP of the recession, both of which he had to make extreme compromises on to make any sort of move on at all. \n\nAnybody that really expected Obama to solve every single problem simply does not understand how politics work. You campaign on ideology, but when you actually have the job you have to actually face the reality of the political system. \n\nIt baffles me that reddit doesn't understand that everything that warren says is pure ideology, and that if she were president she would have to make the exact same compromises that Obama has to make, barring extreme abuse of power. \n\nIf she does make it to the White House eventually, she'll probably be pretty good, just like Obama is, and she'll still receive massive amounts of nonsensical criticism, just like Obama does."

aS'How are we defining "reading" here? From all accounts, the TPP is a massively long document, somewhere in the area of 30,000 pages. I doubt few individuals, much less Obama personally, have read every single page of the agreement. I\'m sure he has read the main bullet points.\n\nAnd in a practical sense, how will the legislative branch review this during the 60-day review period? Will each member of Congress source a team to comb through the document? Is there evidence they\'re currently soliciting volunteers for a crowdsourcing effort? That\'s 500 pages a day if it is indeed 30,000 pages, and still a ton if it\'s only 10,000 pages.\n\nThe length of the document alone should give people pause that it\'s easy for items to get missed during the review period. More to the point, I would wager many in Congress will vote ideologically rather than take the time and effort to actually review the TPP in full. In the end, I think only a handful of people in the world will have read the TPP in full, because it was designed by the consensus of nationals and multinational companies. I\'m sure most of them have read the sections pertaining to them or that they\'ve submitted in draft, but it\'s probably only a small number of lawyers that have read the entirety of the TPP.\n\n**TL;DR:** I don\'t think Obama\'s read it as deeply as your implying. I\'m concerned that few have and will read the TPP in its entirety before the review period is over.'

aS'First of all, as a comment below notes, about 98% of black Americans voted for Obama.  Are they racist?\n\nSecondly, there were a significant number of progressive, white Americans who voted for him so they could say "See, I am not racist even though I live in this gated community, I voted for Obama".  You are a fool if you think this didn\'t happen.\n\nI was working abroad at the time, so I didn\'t vote, forgot to get my absentee ballot.  But when people at work asked me I said I thought either Obama or McCain would be good presidents and we were lucky to have such good candidates.  Obama\'s race had no impact on whether or not I would have voted for him.  Sadly, Obama turned out to be a far more divisive President than he could have been, and I think his lack of experience (only a few years in the Senate, no real job outside of academia before that) was part of the reason.\n\nSadly as well, there probably are conservatives that didn\'t vote for him, or wouldn\'t, because of his race.  There are also liberals who only voted for him because of his race, quite a few I suspect.  I understand your focus on the former, but I think it is much less than you make it out to be.  Your lack of concern on the latter situation is disturbing, though.  I would imagine if I gave you a truth serum you would say that it didn\'t bother you at all that many voted for him just because of his race, and that is also sad, for that is no way to elect a president.'

aS"&gt; but would you really rather have had McCain calling the shots?\n\nAgain, I don't think it'd make that much of a difference. Internationally, Obama has spread US aggression around the world way too thin, and McCain might have done the exact same thing but McCain might have used more common sense. For example, despite McCain's rhetoric of bombing Iran, the Pentagon would exercise their veto if he were actually serious.\n\nWith a McCain presidency, there would have been a snowball's chance in hell that the US might actually punish our torturers compared to Obama openly protecting them. And I think it's safe to say McCain would have stopped all US torture, instead of Obama's mealy-mouthed rhetoric as US torture goes on in dark corners around the world like Bagram.\n\nDomestically there would have been differences. Instead of Democrats shoving an immoral, right-wing corporate health care system down our throats, the Democrats would have had to actually pretend to be a party of the people and would have to play a defensive role rather than the do-nothing role they're playing today.\n\nOn issues like gay rights there'd be no change just because the social or cultural movements backing those issues are so strong that it makes both of our corrupt parties irrelevant."

aS'If you\'re a gambling man, I\'d say Marco Rubio is a bit undervalued right now as the eventual GOP Nominee and Jeb Bush is a horribly risky bet. Right now they\'ve given Rubio about 20% odds of being the nominee and Jeb about 32%. That might be a bit "safe" right now but I\'d put Rubio much closer to even money and Jeb Sown to around 10-15%. While Jeb Bush polls well against Hillary Clinton (Recently pulling +3/+6/-2 in New Hampshire) , his ~~center-right~~ ~~RINO~~ ~~UnAmerican~~ ~~UnChristian~~ ~~Liberal~~ political positions are becoming increasingly unacceptable to the base. Jeb Bush, simply put, isn\'t who they feel they need. What they need is someone that appeals to the base AND can beat Hillary Clinton and there\'s only one man who comes close: Marco Rubio.\n\nHistorically, the only person who\'s ever beat Hillary Clinton is Barack Obama. So what the GOP likely needs is their own Obama: The Anti-Obama, if you will. So what did Obama have that was so special? Not his policy positions. Typical boilerplate center-left rhetoric and not so different from Hillary\'s position or the Democratic platform. But it was put way, WAY more eloquently by Obama than it ever was by Hillary (who, it mush be said, shot herself in the foot by trying to run a general election campaign on day one and then shot herself in the face when she realized all to late that she forgot she actually had to win some damn primaries first -- a mistake she does not intend to repeat.) Then there was his biography: Son of a teacher from Kansas an a man from Kenya, born in Hawaii, raised around the world, later he\'d go on to Harvard, become a lawyer and work tirelessly as a community activist. I mean just a helluva biography. Hillary had nothing on that.\n\nSo what does the right need to assemble the Anti-Obama: Soaring rhetoric, Good Biography, and political positions that at a minimum please the base. Jeb Bush gets you none of those things (which, hint-hint, Republicans, is probably why he\'s doing so well against Hillary). Scott Walker gets you 1 out of 3. Rand Paul gets you maybe about 1.5 out of 3. All the rest: Cruz, Christie, Fiorina, Carson, Huckabee (2015 edition): get you 0-1.5 out of 3 on the Obama meter. But Marco Rubio gets you 2 out of 3:  A great biography (son of Cuban immigrants, pulled up by his own bootstraps, highly religious upbringing [don\'t say the Mormon word]), and while he was out in the weeds on immigration for a bit, everything else he says is boilerplate conservative rhetoric. All that Marco let-me-get-a-sip-of-water-real-quick Rubio needs is to be a helluva captivating speaker (and that can, to an appreciable extent, be taught) and he ticks all the anti-Hillary/anti-Obama marks: good biography + policy positions that appeals to the base + eloquence enough to sell that to the middle, and he can be a contender -- at least better than all the other GOP alternatives.'

It may have been the case that Hillary ran literally uncontested, rather than arguably virtually uncontested, simply because the media declared her to be inevitable or the only electable one, and in doing so managed to bring about that truth.

aS'I agree with everything you\'ve said. And, much like Continuity_organizer\'s comment, it has absolutely nothing to do with the situation at hand.\n\nThe entire line of reasoning that Obama put forward was, "I am an aggressive watchdog of wallstreet, I have started and won fights with them before, so you should trust that I would never approve a trade deal that is favorable to big business at the expense of the common citizen."\n\nAnd GoogleOpenLetter\'s point was that Obama has done no such thing. And therefore we should absolutely not, based upon his record, take it on faith that he would never approve a deal that benefits large businesses at others\' expense.\n'

aS"It's fair to say that she may have to start compromising. I think that there's a way to compromise. Obama agreeing with the Republicans on a huge trade deal like this, and things like the Patriot Act and drilling go beyond that. I'd personally like to have a President who wouldn't stand for really bad things like this. What I think is that if you took a look at his Senate record, you knew he supported these things all along, and that he's not compromising. He's always been and has governed as a Third Way Clintonian.\n\nTo clear up the Gitmo misconception, Obama's plan was actually regressive. It stripped detainees of more rights, and the ACLU opposed it. Warren and Sanders actually both voted against it too.\n\nI personally think she'd be much better, even though I'm not sold to her 100%. There are still positions of hers I'd like to know. I'm by far convinced Sanders would be many times better than Obama.\n\n"

aS'See, I admit a lot of what you said is true, but\n\n&gt; First of all, as a comment below notes, about 98% of black Americans voted for Obama. Are they racist?\n\nNo. they always vote democratic.\n\n&gt; Sadly, Obama turned out to be a far more divisive President than he could have been, and I think his lack of experience (only a few years in the Senate, no real job outside of academia before that) was part of the reason.\n\nNo. The GOP made him look divisive, when most of the time he just did what an average democratic president might do.\n\n&gt;  I would imagine if I gave you a truth serum you would say that it didn\'t bother you at all that many voted for him just because of his race, and that is also sad, for that is no way to elect a president.\n\nI know that happened, but it doesn\'t bother me, because I\'m confident that Obama has been a better president than either of those candidates would have been. I also think more people *didn\'t* vote for him because he\'s black than *did*. Also I, and many other Americans (I think), are tired of war. I was already in 2008. McCain would have just exacerbated the war situation, and Romney doesn\'t know what it\'s like be poor; he wouldn\'t have represented America and would have instituted policies that help the 1%.\n\nTo me, a lot of your points just sound kind of butthurt that your guy didn\'t win, and trying to justify it by saying he\'s \'divisive\'. I think if he were part of the OWG club, he\'d be hailed as pretty good president. Probably not as good as Clinton, but still pretty good. The ways in which he might look divisive were mostly caused by the GOP\'s obstructionism. I don\'t think he\'s perfect, but I think he does decent overall. I wish he were again less pro-war, but I don\'t understand enough about foreign policy to make a judgement there. But people question the legitimacy of his presidency like this:\n\n&gt; many voted for him just because of his race, and that is also sad, for that is no way to elect a president.\n\nWell, he still won fair and square, unlike one president I can think of (by supreme court decision is "no way to elect a president").'

I did find the section you were talking about: \n\n&gt;Opponents have charged that the deal is being negotiated secretly and without their input. (Obama points out that anyone with access to the Internet will have 60 days to scrutinize the deal before he even signs it and sends it on to Congress, which would then begin its own period of evaluation, so its not like anyone is going to wake up and find that Congress just sold the Lincoln Memorial to Taiwan.)\n\n If this holds true I will hold my tongue until I have read the agreement in its entirety.

p1002
aS'However, the polling would suggest that Mr. Sanders is incorrect.\n\n-----------------\n\nI\'ve made the same post on the subject a [couple](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqvvpsg) of [times](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqvvpsg) and thought I\'d reiterate it here. \n\n\n----------------------------------\n\nUsing the Obama primary campaign as a comparison, what is the likelihood of Sanders\' campaign against Clinton succeeding? [Here\'s the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.\n\nThe following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:\n\n* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, \n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%\n\n* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%\n\nNow, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):\n\n* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% \n\n* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   \n\n* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, \n\n* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%\n\nSo, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It\'s hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it\'s an insanely large difference.\n\nSecondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus "not-Hillary" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary\'s level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains "flat" she\'ll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). \n\nAdditionally, the "not Hillary / Bernie" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she\'s included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She\'s [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). \n\nIf I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the \'08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially "Warren Lite". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.\n\nSo where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)\n\n-----------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama "only" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he\'ll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she\'s doing a better job positioning herself as the "populist" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn\'t chip away at her initial polling numbers.\n\n[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]\n\n\n-------------------\n\nNow, as has [been correctly pointed out in each of the two times I\'ve posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqw26xs), Obama entered the primary in February, so by now he\'d already been campaigning for some time. However, when you go back to the February data, the picture just gets more damning. \n\nLets look at the data back in mid-Feb. There were two polls 2 days after Obama announced:\n\n** Poll 1**\n\n* Clinton 37% - Obama 17%, \n\n** Poll 2**\n\n* Clinton 28%, Obama 24%\n\nSo this actually paints an even bleaker picture for Sanders. Coming into the race, Obama and Clinton were polling neck and neck in one poll and were relatively close in the other. Sanders is down by like 50 points in all of the polls from early May when he announced.\n\n#In Conclusion:\n\nThe polling data would suggest that Sanders is going to have a much harder time (than Obama) dismantling the "presumptive nominee" Hillary Clinton.\n\n'

aS'Really?  My point is that supply side economics has been proven to be ineffective.  Comparing Reagan to Obama is hilarious.

p1005
aS"Well, there are some other factors.  First, there is significantly more class division this time and Sanders has a lot more appeal to the much more numerous class.  Second, past elections were largely negative--people voted against other candidates instead of for their own.  Obama made strong gains by taking a more positive approach--the Hopey-Changey thing.  Sanders' campaigns have all been 100% positive.  Third, Dean's 50-state strategy had a powerful influence in 2008.  Dean seems to like Sanders' chances.  Fourth, the Iraq War vote is still a big deal to many of us.  Hillary has admitted that she considers it a mistake.  Sanders can run around and proudly say he was right and can foresee consequences she can't. \n\nSo I think it's much more complex than simply taking past polling patterns and mapping them to today's dates and numbers."

aS'&gt; With the electorate rapidly shifting to the left,\n\nI would normally ask you to cite your statement with some data, but honestly you are just speaking emotionally.  Obama was just an overreaction to the Bush administration, not a real shift in overall national feeling.  Additionally, the congress is the most heavily Republican since the 1950s, and that is an absolute repudiation of this assertion of yours.

Even without that, might as well have Sanders making executive orders among all the blockage.

That will mean the national conversation will show the Republicans for what they are, and mid-term elections will have better turnouts for Dems. "

I'm open to the idea that McCain or Romney would have turned progressive in the White House, but I think it would have been pretty scary to vote on them based on the notion that might happen.  "

The countries involved in this agreement are a part of the fastest growing area in the world and they are going to be the next hot markets.  So what, just sit around and let other countries dictate the trade rules?  Pretend that we can really stop globalization?  Argue for a better deal, ok what do you think you can get out of them that Obama hasn't tried?  In all honesty, this is starting to look like the Obamacare scare nonsense but for the left.  You can't be against a deal, because there isn't a deal yet to be made.  The reason for fast track authority is that you can't have 535 different people offering up amendments to an agreement that involves 11 different sovereign nations.  For every amendment they would have to go back to the countries and say hey do you agree with this?  On the secrecy, every single international agreement is done in secret from the Iran nuclear talks to trade agreements.  You really can't have serious negotiations without them because people have to be frank, and they're not going to do that if they feel like they have to posture to the general public.  Wait until the actual deal comes out, read it and if you think its generally bad then lobby your congressman to oppose it, and if you think its good, lobby to approve it.  One thing Obama is right about though and that is the status quo is whats killing our labor market, and we can't compete for low wage manufacturing, unless you want making 56 cents an hour to be the new norm."

aS'&gt; Ok. To what end? What are you trying to convince us to do and why are you trying to convince us to do it?\n\nI\'m not the user in question, you should keep in mind that whether the user has ulterior motives doesn\'t impact the validity of their points. Now to expand on what is (likely) motivating the user in question: it is important to have a good model of reality, and not to lie to one\'s self about things. This is especially important because once one starts lying about reality is very easy to just keep doing so, rather than admit one was wrong. One saw this on election night with Karl Rove where he *could not admit* that he was wrong about what was going to happen. Similarly, one saw in the last two elections massive numbers of conservatives who were convinced that people must actually support what they want and so there had to have been voter fraud to get Obama elected. That\'s how you got ideas about people being "bused in" and similar things. It is almost always better to have an accurate model of reality.\n\nI\'m curious, how likely do you think it is that Bernie will win the nomination? '

aS"I disagree, I'll focus on this much more but Ron Paul has had a populist campaign strategy and it turned out very little results, Perot was probably the last somewhat successful populist candidate and he had to spend an insane amount to get the 18% he got running as a independent. Looking at it Obama was much better positioned than sanders so much so it's far off to even compare the paths they had/have, the only thing revolutionary with sanders its virally backed very early where Obama tapped into social media a little later but to a much bigger degree. Obama used a grassroots campaign but he compounded it with an effective strategy to win the primary with endorsements and big name support. Sanders has almost no super delegate support at the moment, Obama had been working on his essentially since 2004 when he did the keynote and connected with long time party insiders dick Durbin, deveal Patrick among others to essential wreck Clinton's party by overwhelmingly taking super delegates, most notably Ted Kennedy who might have been so important it won him the whole damn thing. On top of that Obama started with Oprah campaigning, which was huge and had an extensive network of community organizers and training in community organizing to win Iowa and gain momentum from there, then bill clinton's gaffe in South Carolina which helped turn out even more African American voters made him dominate South Carolina. \n\nObama started out stronger, caught Clinton by surprise and have a clear plan set in place to win the nomination with years of back work and it BARELY worked out for him. That's not to even mention he was a once in a political generation speaker and excellent debater with a clear concise message. Sanders has a nice message but isn't a great orator, doesn't have any democratic connections (he's not even been in the party, he's ran against democrats his support by the brass of the party is very small) and many other factors on top of how hard it was to beat Clinton the first time, most likely harder this time now she's taking the primary serious from the beginning and essentially paid her dues to the party elite means sanders has a very small chance of pulling anything off. He's improved but not polling as well as Obama when he started off and his fundraising numbers look nice now but over the scope of what the primary and general will cost isn't all that important yet, especially with the fundraising power that Clinton has. \n\nObama winning was a surprise but completely on plan and had a clear path. Sanders currently doesn't. Super delegates keep getting overlooked, as does how hard it was for Clinton to be beat in 2008 and how it was basically a perfect storm to lead to Obama's win. "

aS'&gt; Why did you ignore the only poll done after he announced his candidacy that shows Bernie at 20%?\n\nI\'m not ignoring any polls. As I stated at the top, this is a rehash of a comment I have previously made (two days after he announced). The Economist poll (what I assume you\'re looking at) hadn\'t been done at the time and I hadn\'t (until just now) gone back and looked to see if any new polling data had been collected. \n\nSo lets look at this poll:\n\n* The Economist (with Biden) Clinton - 58%, Sanders - 17%, Biden - 13%\n* The Economist (without Biden) - Clinton 68%, Sanders - 20%\n\nSo, what do we see here compared to the other polls? I see two important notes. \n\n1. First, all the Biden supporters flock to Clinton when given a choice between Clinton and Sanders. Biden voters are generally going to be the more moderate voters, so this makes sense. There\'s more it implies about the difficulties with Sanders appealing to moderate voters in general (which would certainly hurt his chances in winning the primary and general elections) but there\'s some amount of my own bias wrapped up in that assertion, so we won\'t get too much into that. \n\n2. Clinton has 70% of the vote right now. That\'s literally (not figuratively, but literally) twice what she was polling at this stage of the game in 2008. If you think this spells a better picture for Sanders you\'re dreaming. He\'s down by FIFTY (50) points; Obama was never down by more than twenty (20) at any point during the \'08 primary. Most importantly, Clinton already has well past the 50% margin that she\'ll need to win the thing...\n\n&gt; And why are you comparing against polls from 2008 taken months after Obama announced his candidacy vs polls taken either before or just after Bernie announced his? Take the polls from early February 2007 and Obama is at &lt;20% in a lot of them.\n\nIf you read my whole post you\'ll see that I in fact addressed this issue and compared the "Sanders two days after announcing" polls with the "Obama two days after announcing" polls. The data is just as bad for him.\n\n------------------------\n\nI don\'t have any kind of "anti-Sanders" agenda here, I\'m just presenting the polling data to make sure that the "Sanders\' Circle-Jerk" isn\'t giving people a false sense of perspective about his outlook in the primary. \n\nEdit: Obligatory holy crud, thank you good sir for the gift of gold :-)'

If anything his policies stand closer to the republicans of today then Clinton's did of his day. Obama has tried so hard to compromise, he starts his positions with a plan that is already better for the republicans then the democrats which is not something Clinton did, he fought the republicans tooth and nail on policy.\n\nSo why the hatred? Especially when Obama if anything, has been the most willing Democrat to work with the Republicans in quite a while. In reality the only difference, is Obama's skin color, and the republican's fear of being seen working with someone who is black and what their constituents might think."

aS"No offense, but I think you are looking too far ahead.. The odds of Sanders winning the nomination are very slim.  The only way I could see it happening is if halfway through the primaries Hillary had some health emergency and was forced to drop out.  Even then, I wouldn't bet on it because the Democratic party establishment would enter panic mode and pull whatever shenanigans necessary to pick someone else as nominee.\n\nAs much as Reddit loves this guy, and don't get me wrong I like him too, he is not electable in our current political climate.  A not insignificant portion of the population honestly believes everything Obama does is some sort of secret communist plot to subvert the constitution and declare martial law. They believe this about Obama, whose actions as president could barely even be characterized as moderate.  How would they react to someone who openly declares himself a democratic socialist?  No amount of reasoning and explaining will convince them that he is not Lenin reborn.  \n\nWhat Sanders run can do though is provide a platform for expressing actual progressive ideas and actually fight for them rather than apologize for them.  This is a fight that needs to happen for there to be any chance of moving the political discourse back towards the realm of sanity where in the future a person like Sanders will have an actual chance.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure I would even want Sanders to win the nomination this year.  People are quick to forget history.  McGovern in 1972 comes to mind.  He was the Liberal wet dream.  He had helped reform the democratic nomination system so that the nominee was chosen by the primary voters instead of democratic party bosses.  Then he ran a powerful grass roots campaign to win the nomination in the face of huge establishment opposition within his own party.  After winning the nomination he received little support from much of that establishment and outright opposition from some of it.  He then went on to lose 49 of 50 states in the general election and lost the popular vote by 23 points making Richard Nixon president again.\n\nI'm not saying people shouldn't vote for Sanders.  I hope they will and in large numbers.  But if we want real change in the Democratic party and country as a whole I believe we would be better served by him coming in a strong second for the nomination than winning it.  Not because I like Hillary, I certainly do not.  Because Rome wasn't built in a day, and you can't move the overton window in one election cycle."

aS"There is a big difference in the starting positions though.  You're starting at when they entered the race.  But Obama made the keynote speech for the DNC in 2004, which is what made him a popular name among establishment democrats.  Bernie became a democrat two weeks ago."

aS"While I do respect and agree with many of his ideas, I don't think he has the chops to beat Hillary on a national scale. Right or wrong, I think it's going to be difficult for an older white man to create the buzz and grassroots efforts necessary to beat someone like Hillary who is a woman. Hillary had a LOT of buzz being a woman. Obama had a lot of buzz being younger and a minority and viewed more as a Washington outsider. It was a close race and Obama eeked out the nomination. But, Hillary DID and DOES have a lot of buzz and support not to mention a TON of practical experience on the campaign trails as First Lady and a Senator."

aS'I feel like any president promising substantive policy changes is the high school equivalent of promising soda machines. You can\'t promise things that are not within your control (i.e. require you to get Congress or your school\'s administrators on board).\n\nObama has proposed providing free community college nationwide. He just knows there\'s no point proposing it to Congress. \n\nIt would take the entire nation acting in tandem to vote on a single issue in order to get Congress to act on it. That\'s what\'s absurd with the idea that a democracy like ours can represent the "will of the people." The House is composed of hundreds of relatively local elections that turn on anything *but* larger policy preferences. As voters, we have no way of voting for substantive policy. Saying "Candidate A" is less of a corrupt asshole than "Candidate B" doesn\'t suddenly get Candidate A to implement your policy preferences.\n\nSo yes, the presidential election is the closest we get to a national consensus around what issues people care about, based on the platform the president runs on. But it doesn\'t really matter what the public wants, when Congressman are accountable to a tiny subset of the people who voted for president and thus feel free to ignore any "mandate" that the presidential election supposedly shows.\n\nAnd the more liberal the Democratic president, the more Republicans feel they can ignore him. That\'s kind of why the Clinton\'s have tried hard to take such moderate positions. By not outright promising to veto stuff like the Financial Securities Modernization Act and AEDPA, Clinton had some real bargaining power. Too bad that particular legislation led to such dire consequences for the economy.'

And Obama was charming and a good speaker, but he had little in the way of credentials, which the GOP certainly made sure we knew.  Sanders has decades of experience, as a Mayor, in the House, in the Senate.  Being outside of politics and outside of corporate america, being a "poor" senator, he has a lot to connect with the average man about.  It\'s not hard at all to make Hillary look disconnected, hell didn\'t she make some remark about her and Bill not making "much" even though they rake in hundreds of thousands for speeches or something?\n\nThe saying I\'ve heard many times has been that the US elects the President they\'d most enjoy drinking a beer with.

He was already frequently [polling within 10 points of Clinton in early May 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates). In mid April he had a tied poll with her; in mid June he polled ahead of her for the first time. Clinton's poll numbers were frequently in the mid-to-high 30s; [today her poll numbers today are often in excess of 60 points -- and that's for polls that include Biden and Warren, who aren't running. Sanders is polling in the single digits](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html).\n\nIf you want to support Sanders, do so!

Then again, Hillary won't be able to and will, rightly, point to GOP intransigence as she runs for a second term.

aS"Not necessarily. It actually depends on the law at the time. People are natural born citizens when born in the US by dint of the constitution, but Congress sets the rules for citizenship by dint of parentage. McCain, for example, wasn't a US citizen at birth even though his parents were citizens. Congress changed the law and retroactively conferred citizenship on people born in Panama to US citizens.\n\nRight around when Obama was born, there was some rule that if you were born outside the US to a US citizen mother, you were only a natural born citizen if she had resided in the US for X of the prior Y years. IIRC, his mom did meet those criteria and he would've been a US citizen regardless,  but the interesting part, I thought, of the silly birther stuff was getting to learn a little about the weird laws that used to determine citizenship.

aS"Elizabeth Warren is a first-term senator, and she's already credited with having a *Warren Wing* of the Democratic party. Having your own perceived wing usually comes after having held several terms and gaining influence throughout those terms. This clout makes her an anomaly of sorts. But the reason she's this powerful so early is because she can cut through bullshit like nobody's business. And, what's more, she'll likely back Bernie Sanders.\n\nBernie is also good at cutting through bullshit. He doesn't have the sudden fame that Warren does, but if you listen to him talkwhether it is in the 80s or todayhis message is consistent and clear; he's fighting for the middle class. His voting record shows this, as does his fundraising.\n\nAs far as Obama is concerned, he's been a good President save for one issue: he compromised too much.\n\nObama campaigned on bipartisanship, and, in his first term, he made concession after concession to Republicans. I believe during the fiscal cliff negotiations, he offered 14 compromises to the Republicans that were all rejected. And, the eventual compromise was worse for the Republicans than all of the offers that the White House put on the table.\n\nIn Obama's first term, he had majorities in the House and the Senate. He could have met with leaders in the party to push through agendas more effectively, but he tried (and tried) to get Republicans to work with him. And, what seems to be his good nature, and willingness to work with others, has bit him in the ass and some opportunities were lost.\n\nNow, in Obama's second term, we see a much fiester President. One thing that's true is that there's no reelection to worry about, and less fucks need to be given, but I think the chief complaints about senator Obama during his campaign were true: he wasn't experienced. He wasn't ready for the shitshow he was going to be dealing with.\n\nThe same inexperience that plagued young Obama is untrue for Bernie Sanders. Senator Sanders (formerly a mayor) has both executive and legislative experience. And, considering his colorful political background, he's used to deflecting the bullshit that comes his way. In addition, he's not backed by big money, so he won't be compromising because he made promises along his campaign trail.\n\n**EDIT:** words are hard"

aS'&gt; Anyway, I don\'t think what he\'s doing actually presents a good model of reality.\n\nAh! substantive criticism of his point. This is much more useful.\n\n&gt; He\'s doing two things that are meaningless or close to it and presenting them as if they\'re valid: first, he\'s taking one week of polls since Bernie\'s announcement and extrapolating out to the primaries. If it were a statistical model, it\'d have an error margin larger than the entire range--so no predictive value. Second, he\'s pulling a pattern from years ago and trying to lay it over today like a stencil while ignoring changes to the context. \n\nSo, I think these would be valid criticisms if he was making these points in a vacuum. But he\'s not. He\'s specifically making the points in the context where people are saying "look what happened with Obama" - and in that context, saying that the situation with Obama didn\'t look very similar and that Obama was in a much stronger position then than Bernie is now is a valid rejoinder, even if you think that there\'s a lot of room for movement between now and the primaries. \n\n&gt; I\'m making no predictions about Sanders getting the nomination seeing as my entire point is that any predictions at this time are completely baseless.\n\nAny prediction is completely baseless? Suppose Bill Gates showed up tomorrow and offered to make you a deal where you got 10 million dollars if Bernie wins and you had to pay Gates $5 if Bernie loses, you\'d take that deal, right? Conversely, if someone offered to make you a bet where you pay $200 if Bernie loses and you get $10 if he wins, I\'m pretty sure you wouldn\'t make that bet. So, even as you think the data isn\'t useful for making predictions, you are implicitly using it to make predictions, just with what amounts to a very long probability range.\n\nLet\'s make this more concrete: suppose I offered to make you a bet where you get $20 if Bernie wins the nomination and you pay me $10 if he doesn\'t. Would you take that bet? '

aS'&gt; Right around when Obama was born, there was some rule that if you were born outside the US to a US citizen mother, you were only a natural born citizen if she had resided in the US for X of the prior Y years.\n\nThis is what always pops into my head when the whole "natural born citizenship" conversation gets going about Obama. The devil\'s in the details and like the article said, there\'s always a bit of ambiguity floating around.\n'
p1074
aS'No.\n\nThe headline is incorrect, the claim to the same effect on the politifact.com website is incorrect, and the claims to the same effect in the comments here are incorrect.\n\n*If* Barack Obama had been born to the same people, at the same time, in Kenya rather than in Hawaii, he would not have been eligible for U.S. citizenship at birth, making him unambiguously not "natural born", and thus ineligible to be president.\n\nHere is the current text of "8 USC CHAPTER 12, SUBCHAPTER III: NATIONALITY AND NATURALIZATION"\n\nhttp://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title8/chapter12/subchapter3&amp;edition=prelim\n\nAnyone reading this should be able to quickly ascertain that if he were born in Kenya, he would not have qualified under any of the subsections (a) through (f), or (h).\nThe only remaining means would have been through subsection (g), which states the U.S. residency requirements for a single citizen parent giving birth abroad. The current requirement is "a period totaling not less than five years, at least two of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years". \n\nBarack Obama was born on 1961/10/4, and his mother was born on 1942/11/29, making her not yet nineteen years old at the time.\n\nThe 1986 Amendment to the law substituted "five years, at least two" for "ten years, at least five". So at the time of his birth, his mother would have had to reside in the U.S. for "no less than ten years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years". Nobody under the age of nineteen could fulfill this requirement. If Obama\'s mother had given birth to him while in Kenya, neither this, nor any of the other requirements of this law could have been fulfilled, and thus Barack Obama would not have been a U.S. citizen at birth.'

aS"Politifact is likely wrong on that, actually. (No one can say for sure since SCOTUS has not issued a ruling on the topic.)\n\nIf Obama had been born outside the US -- he wasn't, of course, but *if* he had been -- he likely could not have become President because he would not have received citizenship at birth.\n\nFrom the State Department website on children born aborad:\n\n&gt;Birth Abroad to One Citizen and One Alien Parent in Wedlock\n\n&gt;A child born abroad to one U.S. citizen parent and one alien parent acquires U.S. citizenship at birth under Section 301(g) of the INA provided the U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for the time period required by the law applicable at the time of the child's birth. (For birth on or after November 14, 1986, a period of five years physical presence, two after the age of fourteen, is required. **For birth between December 24, 1952 and November 13, 1986, a period of ten years, five after the age of fourteen, is required for physical presence in the United States or one of its outlying possessions to transmit U.S. citizenship to the child.)** The U.S. citizen parent must be the genetic or the gestational parent and the legal parent of the child under local law at the time and place of the childs birth to transmit U.S. citizenship.\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-child-born-abroad.html (emphasis addded)\n\nBecause Obama's mother was 18 at the time Obama was born, she could not have lived in the US long enough to have met the residency requirement to transmit citizenship to him had he been born abroad.\n\nCruz's mother, however, did meet the residency requirement at the time Cruz was born, so he was a citizen at birth regardless of where in the world he was born."

aS'And maybe Obama likes it but this fight between he and Warren is political theater that allows the Dems who still have to continue getting elected can say they opposed Obama and are looking out for the worker while the GOP has to support this and get pinned into the anti-worker corner.\n\nObama has no more elections and can afford to take a hit like this.  '
p1083
aS"Warren is a hypocrite and a pretty bad one. She's perfectly fine allowing Obama and the U.S. to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran without any influence from congress because she knows, in that instance, you can't have a thousand voices at the table from congress dictating what should and shouldn't go into the deal, and yet opposes essentially the same move on trade. Pretty incredulous. \n\nShe either trusts Obama or she doesn't but there really is no middle ground here. You can't be fine with secret nuclear deals that leave congress out of the loop and get your panties in a bunch the second the President takes the same approach when it comes to trade. \n\nIt's laughable listening to her, and other liberals, defend Obama on Iran by saying it would be way too much an issue to allow the congress to debate and change certain parts of a deal agreed upon with other nations and essentially call for the same thing here, which makes any negotiation impossible to begin with. \n\nShe either believes the president has the power or doesn't. But this playing different sides on this issue is just as pathetic as the shit the Republicans played with Iran.\n\nInterestingly, though, that you didn't once hear her question Obama's motives for secret negotiations then and demanding congress see what we're agreeing to and then being allowed to vote on it. "
p1084
aS"That only works if there's nothing that you want to pass.  Obama had a huge agenda he wanted passed so he needed to make concessions to do that.\n\nOn the other hand all you need to do to get Sander's agenda is to not pass anything new and use what's already there.  The only parts that require legislation actually require a Constitutional Amendment (Citizens United).\n\nThat said there's also the problem if getting appointments through.  If Sanders stonewalls completely he'll have no cabinet and he'll be losing lawsuits because everyone in his cabinet will be temporaries."
p1085
aS"I stated this in another thread, and am reposting this here.  Kind of my whole opinion on the whole deal:\nSo /r/politics seems to hate this deal. My question would be, what would you do differently? The countries involved in this agreement are a part of the fastest growing area in the world and they are going to be the next hot markets. So what, just sit around and let other countries dictate the trade rules? Pretend that we can really stop globalization? Argue for a better deal, ok what do you think you can get out of them that Obama hasn't tried? In all honesty, this is starting to look like the Obamacare scare nonsense but for the left. You can't be against a deal, because there isn't a deal yet to be made. The reason for fast track authority is that you can't have 535 different people offering up amendments to an agreement that involves 11 different sovereign nations. For every amendment they would have to go back to the countries and say hey do you agree with this? On the secrecy, every single international agreement is done in secret from the Iran nuclear talks to trade agreements. You really can't have serious negotiations without them because people have to be frank, and they're not going to do that if they feel like they have to posture to the general public. Wait until the actual deal comes out, read it and if you think its generally bad then lobby your congressman to oppose it, and if you think its good, lobby to approve it. One thing Obama is right about though and that is the status quo is whats killing our labor market, and we can't compete for low wage manufacturing, unless you want making 56 cents an hour to be the new norm.\n"
p1086
aS"I know, right? Like remember when Obama made universal healthcare a thing through executive action because Congress no longer matters? Or when he declared all future presidential elections to be void after declaring a state of emergency, making his office a lifetime appointment? Remember when he brought charges against the financial industry for crashing the economy? Remember when he closed Guantanamo Bay and all of his appointments were forced through? Remember how none of the bills that he proposed or supported were voted on? Remember when he came and stole everyone's guns and then nullified the second amendment? Terrible times we're living in."

aS'The reason no one called Obama a flip-flopper on gay marriage is no one really believed Obama was actually an opponent of gay marriage and that he just said he was only for civil unions out of political expediency.

p1090
aS'maybe. It\'s a really significant trade agreement, Obama has caved to Wall Street and big business interests in the past--the ACA certainly helped the pharmaceutical and insurance industries.

That was obvious in the run up to the 2008 election and it was obvious after he had filled his Cabinet and other high-level staff positions.\n\nAlso, the idea that people stop caring about money once they have some is patently ridiculous.

aS'George W. Bush isn\'t in office. But the elite political class still is in power and working for the interests of corporations more than ever. George W. Bush was just a puppet. His father was a puppet. Obama is a puppet.\n\nOn each election, you\'re getting new packaging on the same product.\n\nI agree, despotic political regimes are often embodied in one man, requiring a cult of personality, and when he dies the regime dies with him.\n\nIn America today you have something even worse, the one unequal regime continues regardless from President to President, because it is embodied in a constructed idea of American Patriotism and Identity which discourages criticism of any powerful military or financial force.\n\nThe regime is coercively operated by these powerful forces by only allowing loyal Presidents who will carry out their dictates. There is a reason it takes so much money to because politically powerful, if they take money from similar companies then what difference will there be in policies.\n\nAs for the American government\'s terrible reputation towards "political prisoners", there have been too many admittances and there is too much international reporting to warrant any additional explanation here. See Google and Wikipedia. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that recently, legislation has been passed extending the President\'s rights. Previously, GWB was able to torture "prisoners" without public judiciary oversight (a court hearing). Obama has extended this power, allowing him to KILL "prisoners" without a warrant or judiciary oversight of any sort. WTF.\n\nThis post is simply a criticism of the American Government, the current regime of that country and how its deplorable actions are comparable to the actions of another regime.\n\nRegardless the propaganda which espouses the moral high ground at home. Neither regime had the moral high ground, and this will become even more evident when these actions are analysed from a detached, historical perspective in the future.\n\nI hold no grunge or criticism of the American public, who I am sure are great people and don\'t deserve this government to be their representative to the rest of the world. \n\n:)'

p1106
aS"OK, gang, it's pretty obvious what's happening here.\n\nObama is cashing out.\n\nHe saw what happened with Bill Clinton - just prior to Clinton leaving office, all the word was about how broke he and Hillary were, and how they would having trouble paying their legal bills.  Then, all of a sudden, Bill is giving speeches to the International Corporatocracy for half a million a pop.  What happened?\n\nNAFTA.\n\nBill signed NAFTA as one of his last acts in office.  And was rewarded handsomely for it, not merely with his own wealth, but also his presidential library and the Clinton Foundation receiving enormous contributions.  Obama wants the same.  So does Ron Wyden - rumor has it he's not going to run again, and so is pushing the TPP as his way of assuring his moving into a highly paid corporate lobbyist job.  None of them gives a flying fuck about the TPP other than how best it will line their pockets down the line."

aS'At least here in the US, and generally I beleive this to be the case that nce some token document is approved, voting is no longer necessary. And in any case it would be the national legislatures, not people. Once a treaty is approved provisionally, it is designed to go into force, \n\nAlso, oc can see that a vote for Obama is a vote for privatization and neoliberalism.

Either way she's definitely playing politics just like Obama is, they wouldn't be in their respective positions if they didn't play the game."

aS"Wrong.  The mandate is not there to benefit those that have pre-existing conditions (disease or traumatic), that is the trade off that insurance companies gave in to get what they wanted.  The real reason for the mandate is to force people on the rolls of the insurance companies to pay for the ones with pre-existing conditions so the insurance companies wouldn't lose money.  This is the exact reason that the first thing that went into play after passing the ACA was the immediate removal of denial of care to people with pre-existing conditions.  Like I said before, this was the best thing president Obama did, and I believe it was all he ever wanted to do... the rest of the ACA is designed to facilitate that one objective, no matter the cost.\n\nI agree with the presidents goals of getting everyone insured, I just don't like the way he went about doing it.  For a very long time people have been trying to think of ways to reform the system while making everyone happy.  President Obama realized very early that you cant do that, and since he had a super majority, he didn't need to.  So he reformed the system, and pissed off a lot of people.  Expecting those people to get over it, or just roll over and die, or forget about it and move on.... is not realistic.  People hold grudges.  When you unilaterally change things and screw people over, you make enemies of those people, and those people will do one of two things.... lay down and die, or stand up and fight.\n\nI choose to stand up and fight."

aS'&gt; I\'ve actually found that, contrary to Obama\'s habit of trying to educate the voter, Warren has a bad habit of throwing out whatever plays well with the base, even if it makes them dumber. \n\nThis is exactly what Warren is doing.  But, to be fair, this is also exactly what Obama did to Hillary Clinton during the 2008 primaries regarding the individual mandate for health care.\n\nClinton supported it because it was obviously the best policy and was recommended by every liberal think tank that had ever studied health care reform.  Obama opposed it because it was politically unpopular, and it was easy for Obama to use it against Clinton by scaring people about "being forced to buy healthcare you don\'t need"--[the exact same attack line Republicans used successfully against the Clinton health care plan in 1993](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/obama-does-harry-and-louise-again/).  \n\nOf course, once Obama took office, he [quickly reversed his position](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/20/barack-obama/obama-flip-flops-requiring-people-buy-health-care/) on mandates because he had to actually govern, and everyone agreed that mandates would have to be part of any functioning health care reform.  \n\nSo while Obama is on the receiving end of the ignorant populism being whipped up by Warren, he\'s no stranger to the game.'
p1131
aS"I want to give Obama the benefit of the doubt: I think *he* thinks he's doing the right thing. \n\nHowever, I think *he* also thinks he knows better than the American people (which to be fair, he probably does know better than the majority of them) about why this deal will be good for them. \n\nThe problem is, he's basically cut the American People out of the negotiation process and is trying to ram this deal down their throats. The actions he's taken - from all the secrecy to the straight up or down vote - has limited the input of Americans and their elected leaders in Congress to have input into this deal. \n\nFor example, let's say Congress reads this deal, and decides that the TPP is actually pretty good, but a few things need to be taken out and another few amendments need to be added. Well too bad - Congress either has to take it or leave it due to the way Obama is introducing the legislation to Congress. \n\nBy the way, this doesn't even mention the fact that the American people aren't legally allowed to even read the trade deal right now. Now, if we were discussing matters of National Security like defense agreements between America and Britain, I think the secrecy would be warranted. I could think of plenty of good reasons why you wouldn't want to make some of that knowledge public. However, we're discussing a trade deal - matters of taxation, tariffs, environmental and corporate regulation - things that the public has a right to know. There aren't any good reasons why what's being negotiated and hammered out in the TPP should be kept secret from the people that it's going to be directly affecting. \n\nBut I digress. I don't want to be too cynical but I think this means that Obama is acting in corporations best interest, in the hope/belief that it'll indirectly benefit the American people, than the American people's best interest. Or in other words, he's putting Wall Street ahead of Main Street."
p1132
aS"Exactly. Though, trade negotiations are a two-level game. The executive negotiates with other international executive leaders (i.e. Xi Jinping), and they come up with a trade agreement plan. Then, Obama goes to Congress and pitches the trade agreement, and Xi Jinping does to same with the Politburo. Since we're a consensual democracy, we actually have a leeway in these trade negotiations because with a bipartisan Congress, we can set up better environmental and social standards while the Politburo will agree mostly with whatever Xi Jinping says. Although China isn't part of TPP, this is how all trade negotiation works, and it's exactly what happened with NAFTA as well."

So, I do not think  he is selling the people out now. I will wait for the bill to come out before I state what you people believe you have all figured out. Congressmen do have the ability to read the bill. If they went through the trouble, they know exactly what is in it. \n\n  I feel Warren is clearly against the bankers.

aS"The reality is that American workers are **already** being pitted  against workers from other countries. Globalization and outsourcing has been going on for many years now and it will continue to happen regardless of whether this trade agreement gets passed or not. \n\nLooking at the actual trade agreement itself, it's a terrible piece of shit legislation that makes it even easier for corporate america to outsource many jobs ... not just manufacturing jobs. It makes it possible for companies to sue a country if that country raises their minimum wage or does anything to impact the potential profits of the corporations ... but worst of all the entire legislation is hidden from the public. No legislation should be debated behind closed doors and pushed through at the 11th hour. For that reason and that reason alone I hope you are against this legislation.  \n\n[You can watch this video if you want to hear some well articulated points regarding this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beOJtXLSQyc). \n\nEdit: What's really scary is that if you look at what this agreement actually does, it is exactly the opposite of what Obama campaigned on: affordable health care via generic medications. \n\nThere are 29 chapters of this agreement.

It's a hot topic, though it's mostly relegated to the state level. \n\nAs for the fast-track/TTP, it's not really news because the Tea Party Caucus is successfully filibustering it. If either actually make it into the Senate, it'll blow up at least on alternative/Tea Party new sites. And remember, the people most concerned about this believe that anyone who votes in favor of it is apart of the NWO/UN Article 21 conspiracy to disarm and enslave Americans, which in laymens terms means that a good part of the TP is taking it very seriously. Likewise, the TPP is effectively a NAFTA with China and the EU (assuming I read it right), which the TP in general is completely against as well.\n\nAll in all, the GOP Establishment is in a huge pickle because they support it, but half their party doesn't *and* is willing to make a huge mess over it. IMHO, if the GOP can't get it passed by 2018 or so they'll just give up on it altogether. Mind you, the TP itself would be in favor of the TPP, however they want to make so many alterations to it that it would be a completely different bill than what Obama negotiated back in 2013. It's slowly becoming politically undoable as time goes on.\n\n"

aS'"Flip-Flopping" has become thing that people view as inherently bad.  Politicians jobs are not to govern based on their interests, but the interests of the people whom they represent.  If a politician is closely watching various polls and shifts in public opinion, they SHOULD change their mind.  If they change their mind to fit the majority\'s interests, they get rewarded with re-election.  For example, Obama changed his mind on SSM because the climate surrounding began to rapidly change.  He had to have a more "tradional" view of marriage to help win over the swing voters in 2008....and he needed to distance himself from Romney in 2012 and coming out in support of it was the way to do it.\n\nWe want to believe that politicians share the same beliefs as us, but it\'s actually more important if they listen to us.

aS'[Sigh.](http://www.salon.com/2010/12/15/manning_3/)\n\n&gt;Since his arrest in May, Manning has been a model detainee, without any episodes of violence or disciplinary problems.  He nonetheless was declared from the start to be a Maximum Custody Detainee, the highest and most repressive level of military detention, which then became the basis for the series of inhumane measures imposed on him.\n\n&gt;From the beginning of his detention, Manning has been held in intensive solitary confinement.  **For 23 out of 24 hours every day  for seven straight months and counting  he sits completely alone in his cell.  Even inside his cell, his activities are heavily restricted; hes barred even from exercising and is under constant surveillance to enforce those restrictions.**  For reasons that appear completely punitive, hes being denied many of the most basic attributes of civilized imprisonment, including even a pillow or sheets for his bed (he is not and never has been on suicide watch).  **For the one hour per day when he is freed from this isolation, he is barred from accessing any news or current events programs.**  Lt. Villiard protested that the conditions are not like jail movies where someone gets thrown into the hole, but confirmed that he is in solitary confinement, entirely alone in his cell except for the one hour per day he is taken out.\n\n&gt;In sum, Manning has been subjected for many months without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at Americas Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado:  all without so much as having been convicted of anything.  And as is true of many prisoners subjected to warped treatment of this sort, the brigs medical personnel now administer regular doses of anti-depressants to Manning to prevent his brain from snapping from the effects of this isolation.\n\n&gt;Just by itself, the type of prolonged solitary confinement to which Manning has been subjected for many months is widely viewed around the world as highly injurious, inhumane, punitive, and arguably even a form of torture.  In his widely praised March, 2009 New Yorker article  entitled Is Long-Term Solitary Confinement Torture?  the surgeon and journalist Atul Gawande assembled expert opinion and personal anecdotes to demonstrate that, as he put it, all human beings experience isolation as torture.  By itself, prolonged solitary confinement routinely destroys a persons mind and drives them into insanity.  A March, 2010 article in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law explains that solitary confinement is recognized as difficult to withstand; indeed, psychological stressors such as isolation can be as clinically distressing as physical torture.\n\n&gt;For that reason, many Western nations  and even some non-Western nations notorious for human rights abuses  refuse to employ prolonged solitary confinement except in the most extreme cases of prisoner violence.  Its an awful thing, solitary, John McCain wrote of his experience in isolated confinement in Vietnam. It crushes your spirit.  As Gawande documented: A U.S. military study of almost a hundred and fifty naval aviators returned from imprisonment in Vietnam . . . reported that they found social isolation to be as torturous and agonizing as any physical abuse they suffered.  Gawande explained that Americas application of this form of torture to its own citizens is what spawned the torture regime which President Obama vowed to end:\n\nIt is not all surprising that Snowden is not rushing back to a nation with a record of treating its prisoners like that.'

How convenient!\n\nNot to mention that in 1996, before he was supposedly against SSM, he indicated on a questionnaire that he was in favor of it.\n\nNot to mention that his own senior advisor said he lied about his opposition to it.\n\n&gt; This story is about Carly and how the truth depends on when and who she\'s talking to.\n\nShe changed her position over time.

Now it's offensive when people ask Ted about his heritage, but it was OK when they were calling Obama a Kenyan Muslim?  Even if Obama's birth certificate was a fake, and he was born outside of the country, that would just put him on even footing with Ted, but because Ted's skin is light enough to pass for white instead of Hispanic, it's offensive to put him through the same paces as the black guy?"

The rest was divided up among water, sewage, government facilities (Including $4.2b to the DoD), cleaning up our old nuclear sites, etc.\n\nThe ARRA\'s largest component was, by far, tax cuts, clocking in at $288 billion.\n\nIt actually gave nearly **double** in tax cuts to business ($51b) what it spent on roads and bridges, combined ($27.5b).\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009#/media/File:Investmentbubble.jpg'

aS'I strongly disagree that the nation is safer under a Republican. The negligence, incompetence, and corruption of the Bush administration led to the avoidable deaths of over 10,000 American citizens, and countless non-Americans. Certainly the average Iraqi was far safer under Saddam Hussein than the political clusterfuck that it became after Bush "liberated" them. Bush\'s foreign policy did nothing to eliminate Al-Qaeda, and it led directly to the rise of ISIS, and because of Bush\'s assistance in growing terrorist organizations who are battle-tested against the strongest nation on the planet, we are far less safe than when Clinton left office (although Cheney and many others are far richer for it). That\'s a piss poor legacy, and now his brother Jeb is on the campaign trail agreeing with that legacy and doubling down on stupid, just to make the neo-cons understand that he\'s on their side and not the Tea Party\'s. And he\'s the Republicans best shot at winning the presidency in 2016.\n\nOf course the Muslim countries don\'t like Obama, he\'s drone bombing them into submission and killing the leadership of both Al-Qaeda and ISIS without putting nearly as many Americans in harm\'s way. So they get their asses kicked daily with nobody to take out their revenge on except each other.  It was George Bush that earned the disrespect of EVERY nation in the world. I used to have a job where I met people from around the world on a daily basis, and literally every single one of them thought America was the stupidest country on Earth for electing that bozo. Once I spoke with them a while, and they realized that many Americans were just as unhappy that Bush was at the wheel, I was able to do business with them. Bush single-handedly made America the laughingstock of the world. Those same foreign visitors were pleased to see America turn around and elect Obama.\n\nBesides, since when did you rightwingnuts attach any value to the president having the respect of Muslim countries? You didn\'t care when Bush was in office, why would you care now?'

p1187
aS'&gt;That\'s total bullshit. You\'re holding up how Democrats voted on a single bill and comparing it to years of coordinated propagandizing by every prominent Republican in the country.\n\nNo I\'m not...  The intelligence community would have fed them the same "intel" regardless and they would have been in a position to either act on it, or call them liars (which at the time was unfounded.)\n\n&gt;Go back and watch the Democrats who voted for the AUMF, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry stress that they\'re voting for it reluctantly\n\nPoliticians saying one thing, doing another.  The vote clearly would have passed with or without them.  This reminds me of republicans acting appalled over any military action Obama pursues overseas as if they wouldn\'t do the exact same thing.\n\n&gt;their language is in stark contrast to the certainty of Republicans at the time.\n\nYes, because they were trying to appeal to the anti-war crowd (which I happened to be a part of.)  It\'s why Hillary suddenly sounds so liberal now that she\'s running for president.  \n\n&gt;We know for sure that the Bush administration lied about evidence for WMDs and that the main reason they started the war was to steal public money.\n\nIt\'s easy to believe that, and it\'s most likely they simply were overzealous about the intel they were given, but the fact remains it was intelligence they were given by the intelligence community themselves.  Bush didn\'t simply come up with some lie in order to get rich as you\'re claiming here.\n\nAs anti-Bush as I am, I never bought in to that blatantly absurd nonsense.  You sound like the anti-Obama crowd frothing at the mouth over Benghazi.\n\n&gt;It\'s irresponsible to say that the Democrats would have done the exact same thing. \n\nUsing words like irresponsible shows how passionately you support the democrats, and by extension how blind you are to their true nature :/\n\n&gt;Bush\'s war is the crime of the century and you\'re absolving them of their responsibility when you assert that it was unavoidable.\n\nFirst - it isn\'t.  There was this thing that happened less than 100 years ago called the Holocaust?  You might have heard of it.  Second - I\'m absolutely not absolving them of their responsibility when I\'m sitting here explaining to you their approach to Iraq is what cost so many lives and trillions of dollars.\n\nIf a Democrat was in charge, they probably would have done exactly as I describe with regard to how to actually handle Iraq, that\'s the distinction between the two parties.  You can get upset over how they voted all you want, but at the end of the day, it\'s what was done once we got there that\'s the heart of the issue with Iraq.'

It's basically a unilateral freebie.  Cuba should be expected to do something to improve its human right record, at the very least in exchange for improved status the US has granted it."

Look at what Obama has done with releasing Al Queada operatives only to find them waging war against the U.S. a short time later....completely counter intuitive and counter productive. Concentrated power? Do you think he had that goal prior to or separate from the Civil War? That was a byproduct out of necessity. Rewriting history only serves one function, and that is to justify the position you espouse, no matter how misguided.\n\nLiberalism has been the downfall of this nation.

That's a shift of 5.5%. If the electorate shifts to the right by the exact same amount in 2016, the Republican wins by 1.5% and with him takes Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Colorado (at minimum). Enough to give him 272 electoral votes and the white house. Now I don't think that will happen but it's well within being a realistic possibility.\n\nEdit: 275 electoral votes. My bad."

The fact that he lied about it for the purposes of political pandering is shameful and irresponsible.\n\n&gt; Perhaps if Republicans had an ounce of integrity and actually worked for their constituents instead of whoever contributes the most to their campaigns, they wouldn\'t have to point at liberals and say, "They do it too!"\n\nBut that\'s exactly what you\'re doing.'

Thinking otherwise means you would believe Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea would all be willing to fuck us over.  None of them can really afford it.\n\nThe US and Canada are tight.  We work off of each others economies to make our own stronger.  Mexico loves knowing that the US is willing to help their law enforcement and economy as a just in case.  The US accounts for 20% of Japan's exports.  That's very large.  South Korea?  Please.  South Korea is like our little, adopted asian brother.\n\nIf the TPP were public, Warren would still be against it, as would 90% of other Dems.  That's just what happens when these trade agreements go to congress.  Also, unions almost always are against these trade agreements as well.  I would happily vote for this agreement.  I think it would really help open our exports up more with countries like Chile, Peru, and Brunei."

aS"I stated this in another thread, and am reposting this here. Kind of my whole opinion on the whole deal: So /r/politics seems to hate this deal. My question would be, what would you do differently? The countries involved in this agreement are a part of the fastest growing area in the world and they are going to be the next hot markets. So what, just sit around and let other countries dictate the trade rules? Pretend that we can really stop globalization? Argue for a better deal, ok what do you think you can get out of them that Obama hasn't tried? In all honesty, this is starting to look like the Obamacare scare nonsense but for the left. You can't be against a deal, because there isn't a deal yet to be made. The reason for fast track authority is that you can't have 535 different people offering up amendments to an agreement that involves 11 different sovereign nations. For every amendment they would have to go back to the countries and say hey do you agree with this? On the secrecy, every single international agreement is done in secret from the Iran nuclear talks to trade agreements. You really can't have serious negotiations without them because people have to be frank, and they're not going to do that if they feel like they have to posture to the general public. Wait until the actual deal comes out, read it and if you think its generally bad then lobby your congressman to oppose it, and if you think its good, lobby to approve it. One thing Obama is right about though and that is the status quo is whats killing our labor market, and we can't compete for low wage manufacturing, unless you want making 56 cents an hour to be the new norm.\n"

That a small shift in the popular vote by just a few points -- a mere 4 or 5 percent -- can take what was a 126-point electoral college lead 2012 and turn it into a single digit nailbiter that comes down to a handful of votes in state like Colorado or Ohio a la Florida in 2000. And speaking of 2000, that is the election that this could most turn out like should apathy set in on the part of the Democrats (and perhaps to a bit of apathy on the part of the Republicans).\n\nI mean, just think of those parallels for a second: In 2000 we had a remarkable popular Democratic president who was reviled to the point of loathing by the opposition party. A prominent member of his administration who is competent but not all that inspiring to the base runs a competent but not inspiring campaign, meanwhile the Republicans, who are tired of losing the White House, settle on someone who is not only politically similar, but is related by blood to the last Republican who won. And even though the previous election had the Democrat winning in a near landslide, this time the election, possible due to increased voter apathy, comes down to a handful of votes in an important swing state. This does not go well for Democrats and a another Bush is in the White House.\n\n[shudder]\n\nOh, and real quick while it's hard to tell what's going on in people's heads in the voting booth there is a bit of circumstantial evidence that points to Obama gaining a couple of bonus points with blacks and 2-3 (maybe even up to 5) points lower with whites than one would expect HOWEVER at the end of the day his performance with whites is on par with Bill Clinton's and John Kerry's."

He can\'t just sign anything he likes into law, or have people locked up for cases we couldn\'t win. Anybody that thought he was going to stop all military action doesn\'t appreciate how much more knowledge and external counsel a president has concerning military strategy and deployment. \n\nThere are definitely things to be critical of, but when he says something like "tax the rich" the response has become "OH YEA, WE\'RE GOING TO TRUST THE GUY WHOS FUCKING US WITH A TRADE DEAL WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AND HASNT BEEN FINALIZED AND STILL HAS TO COME TO A VOTE". \n\nWhat sucks is that the whole push and pull between the two parties is largely a cultural thing, so even the people who consider themselves liberal (which is the smarter and more rational party) aren\'t reaching that decision through informed thoughtfulness, but rather because it\'s popular right now. I\'d rather people be on the right side for the wrong reasons than on the wrong side for the wrong reasons, but what would really be ideal is if a huge portion of the Democratic Party wasn\'t just as ignorant as the Republican Party, and happen to have backed the better bandwagon. It makes the democratic base seems stupid, like the occupy Wall Street movement, or just the general naivety surrounding warren, who is being hyped exactly the same way as Obama was, before he started having to actually do the job. \n\nI mean, I like her too, but if you\'re really convinced she wouldn\'t be making compromises or using drones or NOT just arresting whoever she wants you need to look more closely at history.

aS'I think you\'re glossing over or not addressing certain subtleties. If someone is insecure or has a small worldview, absolutely--a more intelligent or learned person may be interpreted as threat. This is common when one group wants to control another: education is a popular tool. Slaves were forbidden to learn to read or write, women weren\'t supposed to fill their heads with lofty ideas and forget their place in the shadows of their husbands. \n\nThen, there are the people who recognize learning as a tool to gain and grow power and persuasion. Apprentices study under masters to learn a craft. A leader studies stoicism to better overcome obstacles. A student desires to attain prestige and success by attending an elite college. \n\nTo harp on Palin a moment longer, her confidence won her few friends in the intellectual crowd, and it wasn\'t because anyone feared her mental prowess. If anything, one would think her "everywoman"-ness would\'ve helped, and that\'s exactly what was played up--"she\'s just like me! She could be my neighbor! She\'s a regular American mom!" \n\nA blithering fool is a blithering fool now matter how finely arrayed or confidently spoken. The difference is charisma. Many campaigns were lost by "stiff" and "boring" candidates. Obama won people over because after 8 years of someone making up words and stumbling in speeches, there was this engaging, well-spoken man who said the words people wanted to hear. \n\nCharisma is essential to getting people to listen, to do what you want, to like you. Unfortunately, it can cloud the view, and like you said--we become entangled in a large web of words with little substance. '

It seems to me that many people are disenfranchised and choose not to vote because their vote isn't counted anyway, so changing the dynamic would shake up the vote more than can be accounted for by using data from a year with a different paradigm. \n\nA case:  Before 2010 there was one Dem out of four seats in Utah. After they redistricted the Rep won another race by a slim majority, and ultimately pulled out of 2014. There are no real contenders now running in the state on the Democratic ticket for any major office even though Salt Lake City, the largest population center in the state continually votes for far left reps at a state and local level. Obama won over 1/3 of the state in 2008, and 1/4 in 2012 when the Romney, a Mormon, ran. This in a state where a Dem hasn't taken the Electoral College votes in decades. If the races were tighter I have no doubt that at least one seat would change hands. When you only have four Reps, one is a big difference."

Which is why the Obama Administration wants Congress to effectively approve the treaty without knowing what will be in it.\n\nSo the debate isn't really about what the treaty will contain.

While the U.S. tends to run a surplus in April due to tax filing season, the surplus was $50 billion more than last year and the fifth largest monthly surplus on record.\n\nThe figures are the latest indication that rising stock values, corporate profits, and incomes for the wealthiest Americans are curbing the growth of U.S. budget deficits that soared in the years following the financial crisis.\n\nRevenues for the fiscal year through April are running 9% ahead of the year earlier, while government spending is running 6% ahead of last year. The fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2014.\n\nFor the 12-month period ended in April, the U.S. ran a deficit of $460 billion, the second-lowest annual figure since September 2008. The deficit over the last 12 months is down from the year-earlier figure of $499 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated just two months ago that the deficit would stand at $486 billion in the current fiscal year.\n\nCongress and the White House agreed to a series of spending curbs four years ago that sharply reined in government spending, known as the sequestration. While government spending has advanced over the past year, April showed that revenues are now running ahead of spending, holding down deficits.\n\nRepublican control of Congress means that big battles still loom over how much money the government should collect and how it should be spent. President Barack Obama has called for an increase in spending above levels set out by the sequester.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans passed a joint budget resolution earlier this month that would boost military spending while holding domestic spending essentially flat. That measure doesn't go to the White House and instead will be used to set overall spending levels for appropriations bills that will go to the president later this year.\n\nMr. Obama has said he won't accept bills that keep spending at the levels mandated by the sequester nor those that boost military spending without parallel increases in nondefense spending.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has yet to raise the federal debt limit. The Treasury has been using emergency measures since mid-March to avoid breaching the ceiling. While the Treasury hasn't yet said how long it might be able to do that, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that those emergency measures should last until October or November. "

When you get a Republican party that won\'t even vote yes on things they had wanted in the past because now Obama proposed it there is a serious problem with democracy. We have a party that is willing to harm this country so that they can score political points. It\'s inexcusable that they aren\'t willing to govern because of their unwillingness to compromise...and, unfortunately, people in their party praise them for not compromising.'

aS"You can actually look at how the tax rates have changed over the years on various online resources ([here's one that even adjusts for 2013 inflation](http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2013-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets)). It's amazing how lowering the tax rates on the wealthiest citizens often correllates to some sort of economic decline, overall. During Eisenhower America, that time the Republicans seem obsessed with bringing us back to, the wealthiest citizens paid around 90% in taxes. Nixon dropped this to 70% before Regan lowered it even further (to roughly 30%). Clinton came in and raised it up to approximately 36% and our economy rebounded. Then Bush came in and gave his famous Bush-era tax breaks and I don't have to tell you how the economy looked when he left office.\n\nObama came along and brought taxes back up to where they were during the Clinton administration and we've seen steady job growth over the last year (at least).\n\nIt's important to remember the correllation does not mean causation, exactly, but it's interesting to look at almost 100 years of tax codes and compare them to the economies of their time.\n\n"

So, when Obama was looking for friends in the house and senate back when we democrats had majorities, his friends weren\'t there - they were compromised through legal bribery.  '

What we called Communism were simply dictatorships.  The key component of Communism is social democracy, which no so called Communist state ever had.  Maybe Communism would be a bad idea but we\'ll never know because it\'s never been tried.\n* Marijuana was made illegal in 1937 because companies like Hearst Paper, DuPont, and other industries didn\'t want to compete with it as an industrial textile product.  Virtually nobody seems to know this for some reason.\n* Our public schools are designed to under educate our kids so they will be unable to affect change in society.  Moving your kids into private schools only makes this worse and helps them win even faster.\n* John D. Rockefeller\'s famous quote "I don\'t want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers" illustrates how the elite see most Americans as a labor force to be oppressed and exploited.\n* [American Slavery didn\'t end until WWII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59-l_cjVxNs) and only then because of fear it could be used against us by the Japanese as propaganda.\n* [Dropping the Atomic bomb on Japan was not necessary](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-real-reason-america-used-nuclear-weapons-against-japan-it-was-not-to-end-the-war-or-save-lives/5308192), since Japan was already going to surrender.

It did not save any American lives.\n* America knew the Nazi\'s were rounding up Jews and taking them to death camps but refused to bomb the railway tracks as was being requested by Jewish Americans, even though they were bombing around those areas all the time.  The sad truth is that Americans also didn\'t like the Jews back then.\n* The state of Israel was not created out of sympathy for what happened to the Jews.

aS'&gt; High marginal tax rates != Socialism\n\n**You have been banned from ~~/r/Pyongyang~~/r/Conservative \n\nSeriously though, of course most people didn\'t pay the high marginal taxes.  Why?  Because you got a tax cut from reinvesting in your company, growing it.  People didn\'t complain, because this not only benefited the country (growing companies provide expanded employment and a larger tax base) but it also benefits the owner/stockholders (growing companies provide corporate raises and more stockholder dividends).  But nowadays in the world of "rockstar" CEOs and ~day~hourtraders, short term profit is king.  Nobody cares about long term growth, so we must cut cut cut taxes and plow those tax savings back into the bottom line to make the executives look good.  And the corporate owned news sources have changed the narrative to "any taxes are socialism and socialism is evil\\*"".  Look at the thread below.  Someone seriously said the words "So long as there is taxation there is socialism. Source: reality"  This is where we are right now.  When Obama proposed raising taxes 2 percentage points (to levels lower than St. Ronnie), there were screams that this was proof of a socialist takeover of the US and calls for revolution.\n\n\\* And the reason I know socialism is evil?  From all those movies and TV shows from the 80s where evil socialist Russia had bands of police running through the streets carrying military gear, demanding papers, and shooting anyone who didn\'t immediately comply.'

aS'I think, in today\'s society, we\'ve got the worst of both systems. So I blame both Republicans and Democrats. Both ideal systems would work better than today\'s system if implemented in full. Let me explain:\n\nSocialism won\'t work perfectly- because you can\'t account for laziness. If people are allowed to become complacent, and let the rest of society upkeep the system, more people will become complacent. It\'s only in extreme utopian socialism  though, and for the most part, a "regulated market" does a fairly good job of eliminating disadvantages to harbor good business practices.\n\nOn the other hand, capitalism won\'t work perfectly- because you can\'t account for greedines. There will always be CEOs who have too much control and can afford to abuse employees. By the time you have the infrastructure that Walmart has, you are almost literally too big to fail, and can abuse employees with very little consequence.\n\nBut the key to capitalism... is that it needs to be void of regulation instead. The democratic party *loves* regulation. Meaning having laws around employment: Minimum wage, insurance, retirement, benefits, hourly limitations, overtime exemptions, etc. along with some industry-specific regulatory things: environmental, food, health, trade, etc.\n\nBut what we have today is essentially (and what Obama seems to like) is more of the free market model, but with a ton of regulation. Which means the infrastructure-rich corporations have limited small-market competition, because any mom-and-pop shop doesn\'t have the resources to compete in an industry. So it allows large companies to develop monopolies.\n\nTL;DR (phew): Socialism would work better if we had a ton of regulations and the gov had a hand in every employer:employee relationship. Capitalism would work better if we had limited regulation and allowed innovative new companies to enter an industry. But right now this isn\'t working.'

aS'I would hope that you would be concerned that the people you may vote into Congress don\'t share your view on a single point you just made. When I talk to Conservatives in real life they tend to be reasonable just like you seem to be, but the people they put into power don\'t share their beliefs.\n\n-There was no real "Conservative Plan" when Obamacare was up for debate, the Conservatives in power bitched about the law but didn\'t suggest realistic changes that would have made it any better. Personally I think Medicare for all with the option to pay for "Premium" plans through third party companies would work better but that\'s just me. Also there needs to be transparency in pricing (imho the real problem with the US Healthcare System).\n\n-There have been multiple times in the last few years that we\'ve cut Food Stamp Spending, it\'s not so much that people want to take away food benefits as it is that they actively have taken away food benefits. This is an area I\'ve only ever seen a GOP member propose, though several Dem\'s have voted for them and Obama hasn\'t vetoed them. Again, I\'d love to be proven wrong on this, I\'ve looked and haven\'t found any examples to support the idea that the Dem\'s are equally involved in cutting food benefits. \n\n-Again, I like you\'re idea. Marriage should be the realm of the religious and the government should only recognize Civil Unions and those should be available for all. I\'ve talked at length with a great many Conservatives about this idea and most support it. I\'ve never seen a member of Congress or anyone with the ability to institute this idea, speak of it. I could be wrong but it seems neither side wants to get the government out of the business of Marriage. \n\nYour views appear to be intelligent, and well reasoned, however to my knowledge they are not shared by a single Conservative in Congress. I\'d love to be proven wrong in that assertion but I doubt I will be.\n'

aS"No they are instead using scare tactics and using revisionist history by blaming the loss of manufacturing jobs to cheap labor havens like China that occurred without any trade deals on trade deals. The fact is the world has accepted capitalism and globalization. Trade deals break down barriers like tariffs that create unfair competition. America shouldn't be trying to protect uncompetitive low wage industries it should be funding education for everyone so they can work in higher paying jobs. Because as shown, even without trade deals, once well paying jobs are going to leave anyway.\n\nCrying that corporations have too much power means nothing today. They always have had too much power, and nothing will change that, even a well written trade deal with never prevent the rich corporations from getting their way by putting profits first. It sounds like people are just upset at capitalism and globalization, but hiding it by convincing themselves that we only need better written trade deals and that will magically bring back the manufacturing jobs.\n\nPopulists like Warren are selling you a lie, and Obama called them out on it."

Democrats generally speaking are not particularly well-known for having a strong foreign policy platform, although IMHO Obama has bucked that trend.  He's disappointed a lot on the left because his foreign policy is far more reminiscent of Reagan than it is of Carter or Clinton.  \n\nOn domestic matters, I'm a social progressive but a fiscal conservative.

aS'&gt; I am blown away at how little people understand of politics. As President without control of Congress, Obama cannot push his agenda all the time, he needs to adopt the agenda of his opponents so they can work together when it comes time to do something he wants. That is politics. That is why Clinton was thought of as "Republican lite" after his party lost control of Congress.\n\n&gt; These are basic facts that everyone should have learned in civics and history class.\n\nFunny, I heard the same argument again and again over the last several years, for example while killing public option in Obamacare. And yet on the one hand the Republicans did not vote for proposals and on the other Obama made huge decisions using executive action. That suggests that the argument is BS. The simpler explanation is that Obama is pushing this becasue he wants it.'

The refusal of the business community to lower what they charge for products and services in the face of falling wages only serves to result in widespread poverty, the escalating loss of consumer demand and eventually the collapse of the economy.  Economist John Maynard Keynes touched on this when he identified the economic "death spiral" that resulted in the Great Depression.\n\nObama is tragically mistaken to assume that Free Trade has ever been in this nation\'s best interest.  U.S. economic metrics and trends prove as much.\n\nDon\'t even think about comparing Rand Paul to Warren or Sanders, Paul comes much closer to Barack Obama on trade than he does to either Warren or Sanders on this issue.  Obama is embracing the tragically misguided Libertarian/Conservative position on Free Trade, not the sensible Progressive/centrist economic positions advocated by Warren and Sanders.  It should be pointed out that Warren and Sanders are the only politicians who have consistently fought for fair labor standards in the U.S. and in every trade agreement.'

Iraq only promised this legal immunity after they realized ISIS became an existential problem for them three years later, but even back in 2011 Americans didn't want to send more soldiers into a warzone where Iraqis barely had a sense of national identity or 'appreciation' for Bush destabilizing the region.\n\n&gt; He concluded: Look, you can rewrite history all you want.

It is interpreted as anywhere from full-blown communist to a reluctant admission that a social program is the only thing that currently works to solve a problem, but otherwise, everything should be capitalist.\n\nLook at Eisenhower in the 1950s, for example: "Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism.[117] He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years, [which had not been completed under Truman."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower)\n\nToday we only talk about smaller government, privatizing Social Security (Even Obama pushed \'chained CPI\', which would have reduced Social Security payments over the years), and cutting benefits.\n\nA "socialist" during the Eisenhower administration would have been a communist.\n\nToday a "socialist" is someone who is a capitalist.  However, they are willing to accept that if there is a great need which cannot be met by capitalist means, then they are willing to accept a socialist solution to the problem.  Medicare and Social Security are examples.'
p1295
aS'&gt; but what has Obama done dofferently? \n\nHealth care, climate change, banking reform, student loan reform, better economic management in general, immigration reform, gay rights, net neutrality (Ok, Bush actually wasn\'t too bad on that one, but nearly all the other Republicans in govenrment right now are), capital gains tax, income inequality, torture of prisoners, renewable energy, the kinds of Supreme Court judges they appoint (Alito and Roberts, the two Bush appointees, have done a horrific amount of damage already), abortion, Bush\'s demand that funding for AIDS in Africa only go for "abstance only programs", stem cell research, and quite a few other big issues.\n\nThere are some issues where the two are similar, and I am frustrated that Obama has been similar to Bush in areas like the NSA, but on the majority of the issues that I care about, they are actually quite far apart.

Instead of finishing the job, he made a less than half hearted effort to get the status of forces agreement signed and created the power vacuume ISIS filled. Those are facts backed up by Robert Gates (Secretary of Defense under Bush and Obama). So without going into the should we have been there or shouldn't we, it was Obama's war to lose and he did.

What happened during the 8 years following is where the phrase "monumental fuck-up" comes into play.\n\n&gt;" So without going into the should we have been there or shouldn\'t we, it was Obama\'s war to lose and he did.\n\nYou\'re being inconsistent.  If the war was won by Bush, then Obama did not have a war to win or lose.\n\nI want to remind you that I have no beef at all with the invasion.  There is ample evidence of bi-partisan support for an invasion of Iraq well before 9/11.  It\'s the occupation and how it was chronically mismanaged by Bush that led to our exit.  Obama could not get Iraqis to approve of the SOFA we demanded and have in other occupied countries, and so we could not continue to occupy the country.  It\'s really that simple.'

Again, just like Scandanavian countries there are corporations, private property, the wealth isn\'t distributed equally. You still have as mall percentage of the population owning most of the wealth. In an actual Socialist or Communist society this would not happen. Land would not be a commodity to be bought or sold, it would be collectively owned. You couldn\'t have corporations or stock exchanges because that would imply private ownership which would allow a select few to own the majority shares and profit more than those who are involved in the actual production. \n\nNow you\'re saying Conservatives are claiming we are already a Socialist nation? I thought they were drumming up fear or clinging to scare tactics that hold overs from the Red Scare according to you guys, to prevent Socialism (which you guys by and large claim to support)? I\'m honestly shocked by how little everyone on this sub knows about Communism and Socialism. You guys might understand it even less than the Fox News soccer moms who think Obama is a Socialist. There are people in this thread claiming "SEE SOCIALISM WORKS!" because we have tax funded fire departments. '

p1311
aS'Obama only wanted to send 300 special forces troops and it seems like that request way denied because they might have been arrested due to some political rife. That article doesn\'t really back up what you\'re saying.\n\nFrom the article you cited while calling someone an idiot, "If air strikes are going to be effective, however, they would require at least some U.S. forces to provide the intelligence on what individuals, equipment, and buildings should be targeted. At least some of the 300 special operators Obama is sending to Iraq are supposed to prepare those assessments of ISISas well as evaluate the Iraqi military and what kind of gaps in it U.S. assistance may address.'

aS'&gt; On the bright side we did get to hang Saddam and make things better for the Kurds, who are front lining the defense against Daesh expansion.\n\n"We got to hang Saddam" -- oh joy. For the exact same offense that people in the Bush administration are guilty of (at least selling the weapons). Dick Cheney sold Saddam weapons during the embargo for crying out loud.\n\nThe Kurds have eked out some gains -- but it was despite the betrayal of Bush the 1st who let Saddam break his no-fly rule to bomb their refugees all huddled together (yeah, a war crime on our watch -- no big deal). A true slaughter that dwarfed the crime we hung him for.\n\nAnd all along, the US has been backing Turkey -- our ally, who don\'t want the Kurds to become their own state. So basically; we are LOSING to the Kurds despite the best efforts of some Republican war hawks. It seems Obama isn\'t trying to actively stand in their way. But it was a true failure for Bush.\n\nSo; no bright side in the $4 Trillion fiasco for anyone but Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Bush\'s friendly war profiteers. '

aS'Obama was no different.  His administration is renowned for having an incredibly controlled stream of information.  Not that that makes it any better for George W. Bush.\n\nHowever,  I don\'t feel like Jeb was necessarily obligated to acknowledge a question like this. It\'s a cheap shot, and not much more than conjecture intended to attack him for having his last name.  If anything, it\'s  a criticism of his brother, not him.  As much as everyone may want to lambast J. Bush for just being a reiteration of George W, they are not the same person.  Jeb is definitely  more of a pragmatist.  \n\nAnd Clinton, the almost guaranteed Dem nominee is anything but open, and will be another presidency of political status quo, characterized by a lack of transparency.  As much as it\'s ignored around here, the issue with her deleted emails at State should be a HUGE red flag for anyone who cares about accountability among politicians. \n\nI\'m not saying you can\'t criticize J. Bush, but I\'d really like to see this sub apply some of the same effort towards Clinton (and even Bernie Sanders - let\'s not "anoint" another leader like with what happened with President Obama). '
p1318
aS'Obama didn\'t try and there\'s no need for ad hominem.\n\n"Why we lost Iraq" on Netflix (forgive my fucked up citation if it\'s fucked up) explains that Obama\'s lack of interaction with the (albeit inexperienced) president helped bring about a destabilization of the region after all the work that Gen. Patreas and his predecessors had put into Iraq removing the terrorist organizations and stabilizing the civilian populace (stabilizing as in guiding the new security forces in operations training and rebuilding infrastructure).\n\nAccording to the documentary Bush Jr. Had handheld the Iraqi president the entire time he (Iraq\'s PM or pres, idk right now) for the entire time he was president, then obama chose not to take the path of his predecessor, which helped exacerbate the issue once more.\n\nI don\'t know man, I\'m a bit drunk right now and my response is probably garbled half-truths based on what I remember and what didn\'t happen.

aS'You can\'t have it both ways; if Obama gets to take sole credit for killing Osama as if he single handedly walked in and killed him, then he should also have to take full responsibility for not fixing Iraq and Afghanistan, period. \n\nObama is in the driver\'s seat, and will be for the next couple years.  He had his chance, failed, was given another chance in his second term, and has thus far failed again.\n\n To use your car analogy, and just for the sake of argument to assume that Bush was as horrible of a president as you make him out to be, it would be more like someone crashing their car and then selling it to to someone "as is", having the buyer promise to restore it, only to end up not only crash it once but total it by crashing it twice, only to turn around and blame the previous owner for selling him an unsafe vehicle even though he knew it was already damaged when he bought it.

I've heard:\n\n* Only did it because he knew his cronies at Haliburton would get it extended, but thankfully Obama prevented this. (Pretty much the exact opposite of the truth)\n* Pulling out of Iraq created a power vacuum which was filled by ISIS. Therefore Bush created ISIS. Obama tried to fix this by keeping our troops there, but was prevented. (OP's submission is based on this bizarre logic. Can't blame Bush for keeping us in Iraq? Blame him for getting us out!)\n* We got out of Iraq while Obama was in office, therefore he got us out. (Straight up denial of the truth)\n\n\nI get it that people don't like Bush.

aS'Compared to what, though? Even the more "moderate" Republicans at this point are so far to the right they make Bernie look like a centrist. Also, Bernie is running on a very similar platform to what Obama ran on, the difference being that he has a long history of backing up his views with votes. I really haven\'t come across a single person who has said they don\'t like him after I tell them about him, which is fairly impressive seeing as I live in a small, highly conservative town.\n\nHonestly, I think we can do it because Bernie is a very unique candidate in that he is consistent and bold enough to follow his word. Maybe I\'m wrong, but for the sake of this country I really hope I\'m not.'

p1345
aS'How many different things are wrong with Jeb\'s argument?\n\nFor one, the student is slightly exaggerating. Bush obviously didn\'t literally create ISIS, but Bush\'s war did create the sectarianism, reduce the barrier to the entry for Al Qaeda in Iraq which did not exist prior to the war, and decimated Iraq\'s economy and stability. \nIn 2006 hundreds were dying as they are now in the sectarian conflict while US troops were there defending the sectarian regime. \n\nIf the US can be linked to ISIS, it is because of the exact opposite of the reasoning Jeb gives -- not because we "left," which we arguably didn\'t, but because we were there and stayed.\n\nFor one, Obama did not really pull us out of Iraq. He did everything in his power to keep thousands of US troops there, and when the Iraqi government refused to play along after the WikiLeaks scandal, he continued backing the sectarian regime with billions of dollars in weaponry and support. Even after the US pulled the boots off the ground, weapons, personnel, advisors, contractors, and others continued going to maintain the monstrosity that the US -- mostly under Bush -- set up.\n\nBut that\'s not where it ends. In 2011, as the Arab Spring began, thousands of Iraqis took to the streets demanding an end to corruption and sectarianism. Guess what happened? The US, backing Maliki, gunned them down. \n\nNow combine that with the fact that many of the people who had been tortured in US/Iraqi prisons had a much less flowery idea of resistance and the fact that neighboring Syria collapsed, and you get ISIS.\n\nPerhaps if the US had not invaded the country, built up a fake sectarian regime so that they could keep it from kicking them out, loaded it with corruption so that contractors could make a killing, and then continued funding them no matter what they did, THEN there would be no ISIS. As the war itself showed, the presence of lack of US troops on its own was not a meaningful factor in whether or not sectarian violence engulfed that country.\n\nOther than that, there is no issue. ISIS is a threat to Iraq and Syria, not to the United States. '
p1346
aS"This is sort of wrong. I mean yes Obama was wanting to get out of Iraq but the situation was more complicated. Actually the issue was with Iraqis signed the Status of Forces agreement with Bush in 2008 which gave the exact dates we had to leave Iraq. The agreement basically stated that we had to be out of the cities in Iraq in 2009 and leave in 2011. It mainly came down to the fact that the Iraqi Courts wanted to start trying Coalition forces for any alleged offenses. They had this power years before but didn't use it and threatened to do so because of public outcry. Honestly the war for Iraq messed up a lot of things. I hated Saddam but he kind of kept Iran in check and radical Islams in the region in check. Another issue is the fact that most Iraqi security forces were basically lying to us and acting like they were far more prepared. When our advisors got back over there recently they had found that many positions in the military had just be boughten by people with no training. Obama actually considered leaving to keep 10,000 troops in Iraq  but the current Iraqi gov wanted no part in it. If you want I'm willing to discuss this with you privately. I did see the frontline documentary. "

After all, as you say, Bush controlled the course hurricanes, manipulated the economy, waged global war. Obama knows he barely can control Michelle's madness and struggles with waging his golf game. A man's got to know his limitations."

aS"It doesn't make sense to view the success of a Presidency by how much was accomplished if we aren't going to look critically at what WAS accomplished.  Especially with the benefit of hindsight where we have had years to look at the historical record and where it led.\n\nBush was a terrible President because of what he accomplished.  It it's a matter of disagreeing with his policies, it's a question of whether or not a person can read econ numbers off a page and I won't even touch Iraq other than to say Obama has accomplished more than Bush solely by avoiding an equally stupid blunder.\n\nYou qualified your statement so I'm arguing with a strawman...but I don't understand what the point of making the statement even is.  \n\n"
p1351
aS'It\'s a good question. \n\nBush signed the agreement to end troops in Iraq. Obama implemented it. To make a non-political analogy - it\'s like you take over a business that has prior contractual agreements. You don\'t have to abide by them, but there are implications if you don\'t. Who gets the credit - the person who signed the contract or the person who upholds it and implements it? Both do. \n\nAnd to be clear a prior agreement doesn\'t automatically mean it gets upheld later with new management. A contrast would be when Bush took over the US and said [he is no longer bound by the 1969 Vienna Treaty on war crimes, wanted to back out of Kioto because "global warming is a myth," and wanted to cancel ABM treaties](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/usa.warcrimes)\n\nBy the way - don\'t worry about getting flak for asking questions.

Al-Zarqawi was killed, and the group reformed as ISI under an Egyptian militant. This brings us up to 2006, well after the start of the US invasion, and it was around this point they started recruiting local Iraqis and started trying to govern territory. In 2010, most of ISI's leadership was killed, and Al-Baghdadi took over, and started filling positions with former Iraqi generals. So by the time Iraqi militants started taking control, Obama was in charge, and they were taking advantage of the draw down of US forces.\n\nTo say the US created this beast is a total distortion of the facts."

Are their independent entities outside of government that affect the economy? \n\nTake Clinton for example.  Democratic president who the economy did well under.  He did not create the Internet tech boom.  This was a huge factor on the economy during his tenure.  He raised taxes pretty heftily and didn\'t see a substantial increase in revenue.  The republicans took power in congress and passed a capital gains tax cut of 8% and added a child tax credit.  We don\'t see the Clinton balanced budgets until after taxes are cut.  The tech boom is in full effect, people are making money, and the government is getting higher revenues with lower taxes.  This is also with the Republicans shutting the government down twice over spending.\n\nAs someone else pointed out, the recession under Bush began with the NASDAQ crash in March of 2000 while Clinton was President.  Bush inherited a recession and then 9/11 happened.  Republicans didn\'t spend 6 years calling the economic downturn the "Clinton recession."\n\nObama is now getting credit for a recovering economy.

What surprised people was that he made his play so early, not that he could play.\n\nObama was an unknown quantity who had a lot of leverage. I have not seen a party operative seriously suggest Sanders can get anywhere. He's not a joke candidate, he'll make a strong showing, but he is not going to get out of the primaries.

aS"I'd agree with you about a month ago -- but it turns out that the NDAA was fought tooth and nail by Obama and the Republicans tacked it on military appropriations -- he would have literally shut down the armed forces and left us in peril if he didn't sign it.\n\nStill, Obama should have let it get shut down on such an issue. But what a field day Fox News would have -- all those conspiracy theorists would finally know the Manchurian candidates true goal!\n\nObama is a disappointment -- but since I didn't really expect much change, he's done fairly good at least fighting where he can. You have to understand that everyone in Congress and the Senate gets checks from some of the same lobbies -- it's an uphill battle away from fascism and one POTUS can't do it.\n\nThe Domestic jobs have MOSTLY been destroyed by Republicans laying off government workers in Red states -- otherwise we'd have 2 to 3 percent less unemployment -- which would really put upward pressure on wages about now.\n\nConsidering the damage Bush did -- to my sense of shame if nothing else -- Obama could have done MUCH worse."

They will tell you how Obama is anti business..without realizing that this administration has given more corporate welfare and bailout money than the last 10 presidents.  They will demand a young man go to prison for years on a bullshit possession of drugs charge for a small amount of weed, while being ignorant of the fact that not one single banker has seen the inside of a hail cell for causing one of the worst economic collapses this country has ever seen. \n\nEventually some people will wake up to how much the GOP has been screwing this country over but unfortunately for most of us (as in this guys case) it will be to late.'

aS"The specific myths tested:\n\nDo you believe that Barack Obama was born in the United States of America?\n\nDo you think that Senator John Kerry lied about his actions during the Vietnam war in order to receive medals from the U.S. Army?\n\nDo you think that people in the federal government, such as George Bush and Dick Cheney, either assisted in the 9/11 attacks or took no action to stop the attacks because they wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East?.\n\nDo you think the Republicans stole the 2004 presidential election through voter fraud in Ohio?.\n\nDo you believe that the United States government provides illegal immigrants with special benefits, such as houses, cars, or tax breaks.\n\nDo you think that illegal immigrants are the primary carriers of diseases such as AIDS, leprosy and swine flu into the United States?.\n\nThese vary from 'no credible evidence to support the theory' to 'significant evidence that disproves the theory'.  Most of them fail basic reasonability tests, requiring either extraordinary precognition abilities or vast conspiracies impossible to conceal.\n\nThe overall research tends to jibe with other research on the subject.  When someone assumes a belief based on no legitimate evidence, it's difficult to convince them otherwise because it's impossible to disprove the irrational evidence they imagine supports their position."

Thats an old trope, and I think you are using it to say *"If they don\'t agree with me on global trade (I love what Pres Obama is pushing with TPP, btw), industrial policy, and labor rights, they are idiots!"*\n\nAlso, word of advice, feel free to ignore it; no one will take you seriously if you compare a group that you don\'t like to 1939 Nazi Party Officials.

aS'I think they mean martial law, but either way it\'s a fucking awful question.  It sets a precedent in itself by even being asked. The question is designed to insert the idea in the mind of the reader, at least in my opinion.

p1403
aS"&gt;His policies resulted in a chaotic middle east that lead to their rise. Obama hadn't even been in office for 2 years when that happened\n\nYou asserted that Bush was responsible for extremists taking over the Arab Spring rebellions.  There was no Arab Spring while Bush was in office.\n\nThe destabilization created by Bush's policies may have led to the Arab Spring - but then it seems like the Arab Spring would have kicked off somewhere other than Tunisia if that had been the case.  The reality is, population dynamics and poor governments and increasing Islamization in the Arab world have been building up a powder keg for some time.  \n\nAdditionally, like you said, Obama had been in office for 2 years when the Arab Spring kicked off.  He actually was in position to back moderate and non-Islamist factions in the Arab spring.  Instead, particularly in the case of Egypt, he chose to explicitly support the Muslim Brotherhood (who are the ideological progenitors of just about every Sunni extremist movement today in the Muslim world, including places like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Indonesia)."

aS"&gt; I was seeing emails from the NRA saying that UN soldiers were going to be going door-to-door confiscating guns\n\nThat's a bit over the top, but then I never saw that claim.

He even voted to help anti-rights organizations continue their nuisance suits against the industry designed to force them into bankruptcy. Obama's past gave legitimate reason to be scared."

aS'http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/declining-labor-participation-rates/\n\n&gt;Among the reasons cited for the trend:\n\n&gt; * 1) **The aging of baby boomers.** A lower percentage of older Americans choose to work than those who are middle-aged. And so as baby boomers approach retirement age, it lowers the labor force participation rate.\n\n&gt; * 2) **A decline in working women.** The labor force participation rate for men has been declining since the 1950s. But for a couple decades, a rapid rise in working women more than offset that dip. Womens labor force participation exploded from nearly 34 percent in 1950 to its peak of 60 percent in 1999. But since then, womens participation rate has been displaying a pattern of slow decline.\n\n&gt; * 3) **More young people are going to college.** As BLS noted, Because students are less likely to participate in the labor force, increases in school attendance at the secondary and college levels and, especially, increases in school attendance during the summer, significantly reduce the labor force participation rate of youths.\n\n&gt;**So no matter who was president, and independent of the health of the economy, BLS projected in 2006 that labor force participation rates were going to go down.**\n\nWhile older workers stating in the labor force is a trend it does not even begin to offset the far greater numbers of baby boomers fully retiring. Participation of the young has been falling because they have stayed in school longer.  And your response also ignores the falling participation rate of women since 1999.\n\nEDIT: And obviously the financial crash of under Bush and the Great Recession inherited by this President has made the labor participation rate worse than predicted.  But when you have a Congress that has refused to work with the President to do anything to improve the situation, other than the initial stimulus package passed by the Democrats, your angry is focused in the wrong direction.  \n\nAnd despite all the headwinds to job creation created by Congress **this President is on track to eclipse Reagan, Bush 41, and Bush 43 in total job creation.  In fact the only other modern President who is likely to eclipse Obama is Clinton, another Democrat.**\n\nhttp://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2015/05/public-and-private-sector-payroll-jobs.html\n'

Military commanders in the first Gulf war and Bosnia did not suffer from political interference when it came to size of deployments.  What made Iraq "high risk" was that you had civilian advisors and a negligent POTUS that decided they knew more than the military did on military matters, and decided that we would go into Iraq with about 1/3 the necessary contingent for an occupation.  What would you expect other than to see the country tear itself apart?'

I\'ve always been a conservative at least until recently because the party has become so totally corrupt that they\'ve abandoned all their morals and even their ideology in lieu of taking the attack democrats and protect the monopolies route. I may not agree with every single thing  Bernie stands for but he\'s clearly the best candidate I\'ve ever had a chance to vote for. I\'m not wasting my tiny little bit of say I have and I refuse to believe he\'s "unelectable" that\'s the opposition trying to smear his name. We elected Ronald Reagan, a freaking cowboy actor.

Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), a hawkish defender of Israel.\n\nYes, only now that the Church is disagreeing with them do they see this as getting political - when the Church and the American Bishops were talking about how bad abortion is and how good Catholics should vote against politicians who support it and how politicians who support the right to choose shouldn't be allowed Holy Communion, that  all clearly wasn't political at all."

It's one of those stories that doesn't really get reported because the terrible outcome never came to pass.\n\n3. Liberal justices. This one alone is sufficient to make my point.\n\n4. Net neutrality. No republican would have lifted a finger.\n\n5. Immigration. Republican caucus is racist against hispanics and no Republican would have been willing to risk supporting this.\n\n6. Carbon and green energy. All the other issues pale by comparison. Republicans pretend man made climate change is fake because they are bankrolled by polluters. Obama has used discretionary and executive authority to support this to the fullest extent possible. And the effects are just starting to ripple through the economy. The cost of a watt of electricity produced from solar has dropped to point where it is now cheaper than coal. We have a climate deal with China. We're starting to de the things that will start to solve this. No Republican is seriously even talking about this stuff."

aS'Hey!  I attend the University of Nevada and I know this student.  We both competed on the school\'s top-ranked parliamentary debate team (at although at different times; I stopped competing before she came on, and I\'m still involved with the team)\n\nFirst I\'ll say how this particular style of debate forms opinions on a topic.  In this style, you have 20 minutes to hand-write notes for the debate.  Nothing else can be used.  This means, in order to prepare the best arguments in that short time, the team must predict likely topics and pre-research topics and arguments.  The side of the debate is not known until the topic is announced.  This means, she not only had to research every side of this, but she most likely had to defend each side as well.  If she\'s on a top debate team, and she\'s debating multiple sides of an issue against other top debate teams, you can trust that her opinion on that issue after that debate has been weighed against some of the best analysis, research, and arguments that exist on the topic.  **I say this to show that this isn\'t something hand-fed to her from a poli-sci professor in her sophomore year, but a well researched and warranted analysis.**\n\nAnother popular argument in this style of debate is the critique.  It bypasses the argument itself to attack the language used in that argument and it forces the debaters to analyze and discuss the impact of rhetoric on a topic.  Based on that, I believe her singular "Bush did it" wording to be a rhetorical attack on Jeb\'s "Obama did it" wording.  Especially considering the analysis she provides after the headline quote.  Like others have said, it\'s silly to believe ISIS was created by any single person, let alone any single president, and I think she applied her understanding of rhetoric to criticize that approach, since Jeb had been using it that very meeting.\n\nJust wanted to give some context.  It doesn\'t seem like many here disagree with her anyway but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Don\'t disregard her analysis because she\'s young or a know-it-all political science major.  She\'s probably subjected her own political opinions to more scrutiny than most of us.  '

Those terms are relative.\n\nWhen Obama made the case for war against Syria, he didn\'t necessarily want to or have an inclination to do so.

And that is not Monday morning quarterbacking. The problems with the intelligence were well known at the time. \n\nHowever creating a government that disenfranchised so much of the population of Iraq did seem to be a very stupid move. Allowing systematic torture to be conducted in military prisons was wrong on so many levels that I don't see how it could expected to result in anything other than massive blowback. \n\nAnd I know you want to attribute shared blame to Obama. But I don't think that is fair. Obama was given an incredibly bad hand to deal with when he came into office. He could either prolong the military engagement and leave soldiers open to criminal prosecution for their actions, leave them there in violation of international law, or adhere to the withdrawal schedule that was created by his predecessor. What other options did he have?\n\nTo me, assigning any large share of the blame to Obama is like blaming him for damage done to a car because someone handed him the wheel after lighting the car on fire and driving it off a cliff."

Obama decided to roll the dice and not work on a compromise bipartisan bill. Social Security and Medicare are the two exceptions, rammed through without compromise and both soon became popular. ObamaCare is not popular, (except as you say with those getting free money). ObamaCare *must* become popular or die, Obama rolled the dice that it will.\n\nNot one Republican voted for it. Now it is the law of the land. Not one Republican will vote to fix it so it better work as it was written.\n\n&gt; Well, they did, but the concept is one that Republicans have been trying to implement for 25 years\n\nThen you have no worries.

aS"&gt; Of course she'll accept super PAC money....But just because she'll play by the current rules doesn't mean she won't try to change those rules once in office.\n\nBut that dark money is coming from people who are expecting a return on their investment.  And they're the ones who benefit from the current rules.  Politicians who depend on big money contributions will govern in whatever way will ensure they keep getting that money - that's why the government is unresponsive to the will of the people and why we perceive so much corruption in our political system.  \n\nPresident Obama doesn't constantly lose on progressive issues because the Republicans are master politicians (although their intransigence is a factor, it may simply be collaborative two-party political theatre), he loses because the Democrats need to keep getting corporate campaign dollars.  And they'd lose those contributions if he defied their donors and won real changes to our economic system.  I'm afraid that President Hillary Clinton will just be more of the same.  Campaign for the base, govern for the big donors.\n"

aS'Nah. They\'ll be bailed out by the Republicans.\n\nNo matter how bad or insufferable Democrats get, you can count on the Republicans on becoming even *worse*, from a liberal perspective, forcing liberals to crawl back into the Democrat veal pen. And vice versa, forcing conservatives to back the Republicans.\n\nThe two parties are codependent. They need each other to be able to betray their voter base.\n\nE.g. Bush revived the Dem party after the neoliberal disaster that was the Clinton presidency. Bush all but killed off the GOP brand, but Obama resurrected it, etc.\n\nSo sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but from an electoral, party political prospects perspective, there\'s not much deterring Obama from throwing liberals under the bus, or Dem lawmakers "caving, on TPPA.'

aS'&gt;Of her top 10 lifetime contributors, five are major banks: Citigroup (her top donor), Goldman Sachs (second highest donor), JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.\n\nYou realize those are all individual contributions? From Individuals who WORK at those companies?  Go to any donation page and it requires you to enter your employer and type of job.\n\nLet\'s do some math.  Bernie is sitting at ~$42/person, and no one has said shit about that. Obama got around ~$66/person.  So, lets assume somewhere in the middle of $54/person.  Let\'s take Citi group. $260,000 from individuals in 2008.  Using our average of $54/person that is 4817.77 people who donated from Citi at that amount.  Now, remember, Citi has 243,000 people according to wikipedia. \n\nSo that works out to 1.98% of Citigroup\'s employees donated an average of $54 to Hillary.  Citigroup, a company BASED IN NEW YORK, where Hillary WAS A SENATOR, and had her presidential bid.\n\nNow, Remember, \n&gt;"Approximately 4 percent of Americans made contributions in any amount in 2008."\n\nSo "half" of the 4% may be a little high. But, also consider that:\n\n&gt;"The top 5 metro areas for contributions to federal candidates in 2008  **New York**, Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston"\n\nAnd I think overall it\'s just a case of "large companies" have a lot of people. And if on average 4% of people donate, the larger companies will have "higher donations".\n\nAlso, you just hand wave the law firms "Arps et al, two law firms;".  When Skadden Arps *HAS* (estimate wikipedia) 4500 employees.  Which means, if they gave \'the average of $54\' half of their company would have had to give money.  Which is not reasonable. She probably had a bunch of lawyers give the max amount (So did Obama/McCain).\n\nAnd also looking at opensecret you\'d see Her #1 contributor is Lawyers with $23Mil, then retired with $14.7mil, THEN securities &amp; investments with $11.2mil (Wall street is in NY).\n\nMany of the people who work at those big firms *are* lawyers.  And honestly, are you really surprised people at large companies donate money to their senators?'

aS"yeah im confused why it's singling out Ted Cruz.  The article mentions that Rubio has missed 21% of roll call during his campaign and Cruz has missed 18%, Rand Paul has missed only 1%.  McCain and Obama missed 64% and 53% roll calls respectively during their campaign for the president.  The article neglects to mention how many votes Sanders missed since he has declared candidacy but I'm assuming none since he just declared.\n\nIf GQ wanted a clickbait title based around the theme that sitting Senators/Congresspersons shouldn't be derelict in their duties while running for president, then why didn't it single out Rubio in its title since he's missed more votes?  That seems to be the crux of the entire article anyways"

aS'Yes, but much more for trucks than cars. Cars typically go short distances and can go anywhere, such as hilly areas. Rails are not practical in hilly areas and so we cant just flatten the whole country for rail such that we can completely eliminate the car. Trucks are expensive and inappropriate for paved infrastructure because of the destructive amounts of weight each wheel bears against the paved surface. That is why trucks pay highway use tax per mile. I have spent the last few decades devoted to the study of transportation solutions and have learned that the problem requires diverse solutions. Bernies idea may have some merit if he think we should all r8de a bicycle to the train; otherwise,  I dont see how his idea can break dependency on cars. Politicians often have ideas about transportation that are not well informed. Obama thought ethanol was a great global warming solution, but it was, at best, a geopolitical solution. I really wish politicians would consult engineers before saying some of the things they do.'

aS'First, I don\'t understand your presumption that I am buying into meaningless bumper sticker mottos. While they might make me chuckle or irritate me at times, I must say you are mistaken in your belief. Good points about FDR &amp; LBJ. Both did great things domestically along with some really shitty things. Agreed. Politicians are more than a series of positions on policies.\n\nI think I would have left JFK out of the mix, though. Aside from the space program what did he do that was good? He was inaugurated in \'61 and shot at a little over 2.5 years into his term. Charismatic man, to be sure, but I don\'t see that he accomplished much.\n\nI don\'t know if the US would be a better place today had LBJ not occupied the White House. I can say that the US is a better place because FDR did.\n\nOf course Obama was a better choice than Romney or McCain. But that is damned faint praise. I think Kucinich was a better choice than Obama, but that\'s a moot point other than to point out the advantages of vigorous debate in a primary system.\n\nI will even go you one better and point out that it was political suicide to vote against the was in Iraq or the Patriot Act when those votes came up. Few voted against either and many who did would up out of a job eventually.\n\nYou are incorrect when you say that the President does not influence the direction of the country. I agree that much of what Bernie espouses would never pass a GOP held House, never mind a fractious Senate. However, after the last 35 fucking years I want an assurance that the person holding the veto pen has the best interest of the working class/lower economic classes at heart. Bernie does, and I can say that unreservedly.\n\nI cannot say the same about Hillary, given what her donor list looks like, given her support of free trade agreements over the years, and given that she was a part of the team (92 election, the DLC, the massive corporate spending on her husband\'s campaigns and the subsequent wholesale shipment of jobs overseas) that started whoring out the Democrats to Wall St.\n\nAs far as I can tell, she is just another politician with her damp finger held up to tell which way the political wind is blowing.\n\nI know Bernie is not of that sort.\n\nThen again there is her personal wealth. How does a politician who hasn\'t worked in the free market since the 1980s amass 15.8 million? Am I to believe that she feels no obligation to those that made her so wealthy?\n\nThis is not really about a candidate, btw. It is about a movement. It is about driving this country left. It is about hammering conservatism down like a nail sticking out of a floorboard.\n\nI believe Bernie has the potential to be the "Reagan" of the left. If you are an old liberal you will know what I mean by that.\n\nStill sound stupid and naive?'

aS'Bernie ain\'t Obama. I really want Bernie to succeed but that requires a massive mobilization of the liberal left which... isn\'t very politically likely. Maybe Bernie can tap into the union angle, but republicans have done very well destroying their power over the past decades. \n\nPoint is, Obama brought together a lot of demographics across spectrums. Bernie brings together... social democrats, socialists, union members, the youth... there is no moderate democratic appeal outside of simply being "not conservative". There isn\'t great centrist appeal for the many centrists whom are conditioned to despite socialism ideologically (just like many Americans in general are). Just think, conservatives running against Hillary have already blown their load with 24/7 GAZHIGATE and emailGHAZIGATE etc etc, and the public is already conditioning to ignore anti-Hillary messaging. But the "SOCIALIST RED SCARE SANDERS" ads haven\'t even started, and red scaring is so fucking effective in this country and our likely voter base. Hell, Obama has the socialist taint, just little dip of it, and he\'s literally their muslim hitler anti-christ. I can\'t imagine the frothy foaming spittle that will be generated over a real social democrat. \n\nObama had liberal-esque side that attracted the left, but was and is a rather moderate democrat who could attract the entire democrat party as well as a majority of independents. \n\nClinton is the same, liberal leaning moderate democrat with broad demographic appeal outside of the party.\n\nI want Bernie to succeed but for all the reasons why Hillary seems like a shoe in, Bernie does not. He\'ll have my primary vote but the demographics just don\'t line up in an Obama way. '

It is the standard agreement we have in all countries.\n\nPresident Obama wanted to keep 15k troops in Iraqi just like he is going to do in Afghanistan.  How the US press never corrects politicians who make bold face lies drive me crazy.  I voted for President Obama twice and it drives me crazy he tried to keep troops both country.  \n\nBut here is the ultimate bottom line, ISIS would still have happened because they built up strength in Syria first and then when they got to Iraqi the US troops were just going to be advisers.   So the Iraqi Army would have still fled when they faced ISIS.  \n\nAnd the flip side is if Iraqi had let the troops stay, Lindsay Graham would still be blaming President Obama for ISIS.  '

Ditto for some people who\'s insurance premiums went up. In almost all cases, that was not Obamacare that forced the change. That was the private insurers raising their rates. It\'s anecdotal, but my costs have actually gone down since my private insurance was forced to issue me a check because they had not met the required ration of health spending to premiums.\n\n\nAnd thing with Zac Galafinakas, I hadn\'t even heard about that. I had to look it up and found it was a case where he was doing a comedy interview. Apparently he said "most" so people say he lied. If he had said "many" it would have been completely true. That was much more likely a simple misstatement than an attempt to lie as there was really nothing to be gained and no harm done. To be honest, when you raise stuff like that it looks like you\'re searching for stuff to support your beliefs rather than looking for issues of substance.\n\nAnd the claim they have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas is true. Please note the word "will." That statement was in reference to his administration\'s raising future federal fuel efficiency standards to achieve 54.5 mpg by the model year 2025. That\'s pretty big change which is double current standards. And considering the strong opposition and little progress over the decades, that\'s a huge accomplishment. Again, it looks like you\'re trying to parse words to find lies. Also, I\'m pretty sure the actual change already since Obama took office is much closer to 20% than the 11% you claimed. \n\nWhile I do agree the secrecy surrounding TPP negotiation is reason for concern, that is not a lie in any shape or form.\n\nThe closest thing to a lie you listed was the Mitt Romney wouldn\'t let a gay couple adopt a child. That certainly is misleading, but it\'s not technically wrong. Because Romney has clearly stated he would not allow civil unions if they were the same as marriage except in name. He would push those decisions back the states where it is clear some states would not allow adoption by gays. But even still, that was not something Obama said. It was something that came from a campaign commercial. \n\nAgain, it sounds like perhaps you\'re spending too much time listening to misinformed bloggers, bogus Politifact evaluations, talk radio, or Fox News who constantly perpetuate these overblown negative criticisms.\n\nSo unless you have other stuff, I think you calling him a truly distinguished liar is way over the top when compared with things like "I did not mean that to be a factual statement" or when I say I mean something literally it is "not to be taken literally" or "we spend more money on antacids than we do on politics" or "the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised" etc. \n\nIf you want to see a truly distinguished lair, look no further than Bush and his administration. [This site details, with references, 935 lies told that led us into an unnecessary war.](http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/06/24/14969/search-935-iraq-war-false-statements) And those are only lies about the war. There are many other references on the myriad of lies we were told on a wide range of subjects from his military service to torture programs to outing a CIA agent to the tax cuts to the environment etc.'

aS'First off, stop linking me to Bush. Yes, you hate him I get it. I\'m not a Bush fan. I know he lied too. The conversation isn\'t about him. And I don\'t disagree with you. Although I\'m sure I don\'t agree with all of what you\'re saying about him. But that\'s okay, we can respectfully disagree.\n\nIf they are kicking us out of the country, then yes I would take the guns. Nothing immoral about leaving a place that\'s threatening you after you tried to help it. Leaving with the guns would have preferable to giving ISIS their startup loan.\n\nYes, the Zac Galafanakis interview was comedy. Doesn\'t change the fact that what he said was very incorrect, and he never bothered to correct it later. Obama\'s corrections and apologies seem scarcer than gold. And not because they shouldn\'t exist. Just because he spends so much time blaming the wrong people.\n\nYou and I appear to have found different statistics on the MPH standards. The numbers I found point to 11 percent. More importantly, his words were, "we HAVE doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas." That\'s a lie, that hasn\'t happened. If you want to talk about parsing words. Pretending that his statement didn\'t resoundingly say it\'s already been accomplished? That\'s parsing words, very incorrectly as well.\n\nHe does not get to decide whose policies are crap. His statement was that if you like yours, you get to keep it. It\'s just that simple. That was a lie, and you know it. You can\'t justify it. What he said was untrue. That\'s called a lie. The premiums will go up for many people. Specifically younger people, and people who are healthy. The basis behind that fact is the age band, disallowing the elderly from being charged more than 3 times what young adults are. And that unhealthy people can\'t be charged more based on being unhealthy. To compensate, insurance premiums will raise young and/or healthy people. Average insurance premiums will go up 27 percent according to the CBO. I can link the article if you\'d like. Another lie in his belt.\n\nSnowden brought the matter to national light. Most people learned about the NSA\'s unconstitutional behaviour through him. You cannot deny that. It was Obama\'s choice not to pardon such admirable behaviour. So yes, he had to flee. It was his choice, his only choice. Agreed there may technically be no lying to be done there. But the omission of those activities from the general eye is the same in my opinion. The clues may have been there. That doesn\'t make it okay. Anytime Obama said he would protect our rights and defend American principles. If he said that while knowing about the unconstitutional activity going on under his nose. Then he was lying in my opinion.\n\nNo the TPP was not technically a lie. Maybe I should have said he was a distinguished sneak. Trying to get something fast-tracked like he did takes away from the system. It\'s not the way things are meant to be done. It\'s un-American, and it\'s sneaky. Though not technically a lie.\n\nI notice you didn\'t respond to his lies about what he\'s supposed to be allowed to do in regards towards immigration.\n'

aS"Just another thing I've read is that historically in Democratic Primaries, black and Hispanic leaders and then voters have flocked to the establishment candidates and helped them cement their victories. Mondale in 84, Gore in 2000, Kerry in 2004. With the argument being that these constituencies and community leaders would be more screwed than other constituencies if they didn't fall in line with the establishment.\n\nWhat did Hillary in back in 2008 was that with Obama running, these groups coalesced around the challenger instead and that helped Obama take down Hillary.\n\nLook at who is endorsing Hillary vs Bernie. Bernie is doing best with college educated white men. We see that in Reddit upvotes. But the Democratic Party is far more than just the demographics on Reddit. There are poor people, there are old women, there are pro-business/pro-gay marriage Democrats. \n\nAs much as it feels like Bernie is on a roll, he isn't quite there and just doesn't have the intangibles to get there."

There would have a slaughter of monumental proportions.\n\nAnd if you see saying most instead of many on an inconsequential statement during a comedy segment as a lie the merits some sort of apology or correction, or even any attention, I don\'t know what else to say to you. \n\nAnd compare the sentences "we have doubled the distance our cars *WILL GO* on a gallon of gas" and "we have doubled the distance our cars *GO* on a gallon of gas."

Another member of the military council, Abu Muhanad al Sweidawi, was once a lieutenant colonel in Husseins air defense intelligence, but by early 2014 was heading ISIS operations in western Syria, according to the report.\n\n&gt;Similarly, two deputies to the Islamic States self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, are former Baathists: Abu Muslim al Afari al Turkmani is believed to have been a senior special forces officer and a member of military intelligence in Husseins army.

aS'I don\'t see why we would "keep Bill out of this". He is an even bigger part of the flawed US economic system  Hillary rails against then Hillary herself.  As much as Hillary criticizes CEOs for their compensation  package the average CEO of the top 350 US companies makes about half what Hillary and Bill made in the past 15 months.  Your "tens of millions in stock options " a year is by and large a huge exaggeration. Only TWO CEOs in 2013 made over 26 million and yet Hillary and Bill can make 30+ million in a similar time frame working for those very companies, and foreign ones, and that\'s all perfectly acceptable.  I don\'t understand the do as I say not as I do logic that Democrats defend so vehemently when it comes to The Clinton\'s.     Your blanket criticism of corporate CEOs is as stereotypical as someone saying all the protesters in Baltimore were rioting imbeciles  or every cop is a racist psychopath. \n\n\nIt is also so ironic you talk about jobs being sent out of the USA . Bill Clinton signed the most devastating piece of legislation for the american worker of all time when he ratified NAFTA.   The AFL-CIO blames  NAFTA for costing the US 700,000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico alone!!    We also run trade deficits of 100 billion plus every year with our NAFTA trading partners.   Bill Clinton did more damage to the American labor Unions then any 50 CEOs combined!! \n\nLet\'s not forget a CEOS primary job is to protect the companies share holders and long term future.  If they can outsource jobs to India where the average salary is 3600 a year it\'s only logical they would do so. The GOVERNMENT of the USA who in theory is suppose to be looking out for the citizens of our county should be enacting laws to prevent this.  Yet Clinton signed in the worse trade deal ever for American workers and president Obama is trying to one up him with an even worse deal for the working class. The unions are so panicked and realize  hope is lost in the manufacturing sector . This is  why they have started this campaign for the fast food workers to make 15 an hour. They don\'t care about the fast food workers, they need to replenish their ranks.  You don\'t find the timing a little strange? Why all of a sudden after over 50 years of fast food workers making virtually nothing do the unions care about the workers at McDonalds?  \n\n\nThe facts are that all the things you hate about the CEOs are things you should hate about your government . The CEOs don\'t write trade law, environmental law, health care law, or any other law of the land.  The CEOs just very wisely buy influence from politicians on both sides of the aisle so these self serving politicians will do their bidding.  It\'s a tough argument to debate when families like the Clinton\'s who in Hillary\'s own words were " dead broke when they left the White House  "   15 years later have a personal net worth of 100 million and control a charity whose revenue is over 200 million more every year. \n\nIf you are looking to beat the CEOs vote for Bernie Sanders . Otherwise it really doesn\'t matter who you vote for in 2016'

aS'Let me give you the Cliff\'s note version: No he doesn\'t.\n\nA little longer version: In 2007 at about this time Clinton had about a half dozen real or potential challengers and was polling in the mid 30\'s. Obama polled in the 20\'s and everyone else polled in the teens at best. Clinton\'s unfavorables were also much, much higher than they are now. People _wanted_ someone besides Hillary in 2007. And the polls (and eventually the primaries) reflected that.\n\nIn 2015 Hillary has 60% of the primary vote and ~80% favorability ratings among Dems. They are far and wide, perhaps not excited with her so much as satisfied with her as a candidate and as president.\n\nIf Bernie was going to move the needle against Hillary in the last 3 weeks he would have done it by now. But guess what? He hasn\'t moved the needle at all. There are plenty of Democrats chomping at the bit for Hillary to have a legitimate contender and you\'d think they\'d be lined up to vote for anyone but her. And they just don\'t.\n\nThree weeks later and she\'s still at 60%; he\'s still at 15%. And my trump card for "Bernie has no support" is when people are given Elizabeth Warren as an option (I  know she\'s not running) his support plummets to the mid single digits at 5-6% and she pulls 15% and Hillary still gets the same 60%.\n\nWhat do you think is going to happen when some other people with liberal bona fides like Martin O\'Malley or Lincoln Chafee get in the race? Or someone to run at her from the right like Jim Webb? Is that when everyone starts lining up behind Bernie? Or is that when we get to see that the "Anyone but Hillary" crowd maxes out at about 20-25% of the base (which is what we\'re seeing right now in the polling) with a handful of people willing to try out another candidate for a week or so before going back to Hillary.\n\nMaybe the law of gravity catches up with Hillary\'s numbers and she gets brought back down to Earth and starts polling in the mid 40\'s. That\'s still 50 points split 4 ways with 70-75% of Democrats still viewing Hillary as a first or second choice. There, simply put, is not enough oxygen for someone to survive let alone thrive against Hillary this year.\n\nAnd before you play the 18 month card, the Democrats\' election starts a little less than 9 months from now. By the evening of March 1 of next year there will have been 13 primary contests held and while the GOP circus will be going for a good long time, that\'s going to be the end of the Dems\' competition because that\'s when everyone\'s sugar daddies will decide if they\'re getting another allowance. And considering that Bernie Sanders, unlike Barack Obama before him, detests corporate fatcats financing his election bid, he\'ll be out of cash by then --  if he makes it that far in the first place.\n\nHe has no inroads to the Democratic nomination. No one does. But Bernie less so than others. Second place might get you a shiny silver medal, but it doesn\'t make you president. '

This is not fear mongering, there are lunatics everywhere talking about forcing inoculations/vaccines. Just look it up.\n\nCalifornia got caught forcibly sterilizing inmates: http://rt.com/usa/167660-california-illegal-sterilization-women/\n\nRemember the swine flu shot that killed more than the swine flu shot in the 70's?\n\nThese people are crazy and to trust them is beyond idiotic in my opinion. Like pigs to the slaughter these people go...\n\nI just don't see how people can look at the history of the world and not fear authoritarians and all powerful governments.

They have forcibly inoculated millions of people in this world."

Bush, and signed in 2008.  Since the agreement had all US Forces out of Iraq by December 31, 2011, the Republican\'s have blamed Obama.  \n\nWe can all say the US pullout was wrong, but at the time, the Iraq government wouldn\'t grant US troops immunity from prosecution, and trials and punishments would be lead by Islamic judges, would not have been acceptable to any US leader.  Then in December 2010, the Obama administration tried to re-negotiate the SOFA treaty, and again, the Iraq leadership refused again to grant US troops immunity, so Obama continued on the US withdraw of troops on the G.W. Bush negotiated timeline.  '

During Gore/Bush debates they even went through how the tax cut proposal of the GOP would explode debt and that they didn't seem to care about eliminating the debt by 2011 as projections had it. \n\nSo to your point, and the point of the voters who voting GOP in 2000, the debt didn't matter as much as it did when Obama came in.

aS"If our political system permitted every vote to count this would be significant. We don't so it isn't. What matters is how many people vote in the 7-10 swing states. Even if democrats are favored by millennial in those states if larger numbers of older folks actually go to the polls then the GOP wins. \n\n2000, Gore has half a million more actual votes but loses 271-266.\n2004 Bush gets +3m votes, wins 286-251 \n2008 Obama wins by +10m, wins 365-173\n2012 Obama gets +6m votes, wins 332-206\n\nthose 2m additional millennial likely to vote Democrat will be spread over 50 states, but mostly in large population states which already vote democratic, NJ, NY, west coast, so their impact in 2016 will likely be negligible.\n\nAll of that said it is possible that this might influence Florida. Obama won by 240K votes in 2008 and only 75K in 2012. It is generally held that you can't win without Florida. it is the make or break state. It swung Democratic previously but the gap was narrowing. If what the article says holds true, even a loss of 50K republican voters will blunt any efforts to win that state.\n\n;told The articles contention is likely very relevant to Florida, but nowhere else for many election cycles when the #s have time to build up.

This country has just gone so far right that a moderate looks like a socialist. Besides, we all know the real reason why right wingers hate Obama. Hint: it's not because he's a liberal. It's the same reason why 20% of Republican voters said they disliked a fictional woman allegedly running for president in a poll. I can't wait for the Republican party to go the way of the Whigs. Just wait until Texas goes blue because of immigration. \n\nMind you, I greatly respect the libertarian faction of the Republican party.

That chicken shit move showed all the rebel factions that they were on their own. ISIS rose up and starting taking huge swaths of land while declaring a caliphate and marching their way across the globe. \n\nBush did not create ISIS. Obama left Iraq without any peace keeping troops and left the rebels of Syria out to dry. \n\nWe can argue all you want about the wars and how they started but you can't put your head in the sand and say that the troops leaving Iraq had nothing to do with the proliferation of ISIS. Why do you think Obama has changed his tun on keeping some troops in Afghanistan and not try to leave them out to dry as well? "

aS'&gt; He doesn\'t back down from questions.

He answers questions by telling you what he *will do*, not what his opponents *won\'t do*.  He tries to give examples of the problems he feels we face, to better frame and ground his positions.  It\'s very refreshing to see, especially considering our current political climate, where candidates can get away with telling you almost next to nothing about themselves, by diverting your attentions to the inadequacy of their counterparts.\n\nI\'m not stupid enough to believe that he\'ll be able to continue this indefinitely.  Being a good politician means being able to show, not only why you are the right candidate, but why your opponent is the wrong candidate.  Unfortunately, that usually means some form of negative advertising or campaigning.  But, like I said, it\'s refreshing to see a candidate who\'s early focus is on really making sure that the people know who he is, what he\'s about, where he sees problems, and how he wants to fix them.\n\nIn 2008, Obama talked about "Hope and Change."

p1688
aS"Hillary is pretty conservative though, and if she was running as a republican would probably have a great run and maybe a win.\n\nDifferent this time around is having somebody who is actually left of center rather than the moderate only-slightly-right Obama.\n\nDespite the circlejerk here about 'lazy voters' and how right-wing, conservative democrats are entitled to the liberal vote; they aren't entitled to those votes. Lots of 'liberal' voters are just apathetic and don't vote... for candidates who refuse to represent their interests. Despite the political strategy of lesser of two evils, many people simply don't vote at all when it comes to a choice of ass-tearing sodomy or shit-in-the-mouth. You might think the choice is clear and eagerly line up to cast your vote for such, but a ton of apathy and 'laziness' does indeed come from having 2 terrible choices.\n\nSanders is more than just an old white man, he also represents a very rare chance for moderate to left liberals to actually have somebody worth voting for. Hillary was and is courting the left as a 'I'm not going to represent you, but who else are you going to vote for?' voting block. She's clearly taking the liberal vote for granted, which is one the greatest flaws in the democratic party. Having locked down the lesser of two evils votes from the left, she could safely swing right... but Sanders changes all that. Competition for votes from the left could realistically force ex-republican and conservate democrat Hillary Clinton toward the left.\n\nWhen was the last time the Overton Window was being pushed leftwards? If Clinton doesnt play it right, the vagina vote might not be enough."
p1689
aS"I'm pretty sure that now that Hillary is no longer a Senator she has just as little insight into the current negotiations as we do. Once Obama finishes the negotiations then the terms will become public. Why does Hillary or anyone need to pretend they know what the terms will be before they are finalized. If they are terrible our Senate can effectively veto it then."

aS"&gt; That's a good one since the invasion started in 2003...Obama didn't assume the office of the President until 2005...\n\nI think you mean 2009... and there was this little thing called the SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement) that was scuttled by the current administration leaving a power vacuum in the region.  But hey, never let the facts get in the way of badmouthing Bush.  "

aS"Yeah but Afghanistan is Obamas. He put 30,000 more troops in there his first month of being president. Now the longest war in American history, Afghanistan is 80% Obamas doing. And the only reason we dont have ISIS there too is because he hasn't withdrawn yet.\n\nLets not forget that Obama has bombed 7 middle eastern countries while in office, and he particularly fucked up Libya which is now a lawless militant paradise, and northern Pakistan where he has killed more civilians with drones than 9/11.\n\nTo say that Iraq's problems are not even due in part to Obamas foreign policy miscalculations is just ignorant. His dealing with shi'ites cost him the support of the sunnis. He played right into thwir sectarian divisions. OBAMA supplied the chicken shit Iraq army with many of the weapons that are now in the hands of isis. HIS withdrawal left them there unguarded. The continued bombing of the country perpetuates another generation of violent young men who haye america and guarantees profits for the military industrial complex for decades to come."

p1694
aS'&gt; Different this time around is having somebody who is actually left of center rather than the moderate only-slightly-right Obama.\n\nExcept I would say the majority of leftist liberal Democrats thought Obama was one of them in the first election (and to a lesser extent in the second)... the whole "hope and change" thing. I still remember reading how Obama was going to be a major shift to the left. But really, he didn\'t stimulate all that much "hidden" progressive vote, mostly because I don\'t think there is very much hidden leftist vote, despite what you see here on /r/politics, which is far outside the mainstream American electorate. Obama got slightly more youth vote than normal, though.\n\n&gt; Having locked down the lesser of two evils votes from the left, she could safely swing right... but Sanders changes all that.\n\nI think you\'re vastly overestimating how many Democrats are going to be excited about Sanders. Most Democrats are moderate. While I think some *do* want someone more left than Hillary, Sanders is so far out there that I think they will be scared off. He\'s literally the farthest left in all of American politics. They\'ll be scared not only because Sanders doesn\'t represent what they want, but also because Sanders wouldn\'t have a chance in hell against any Republican. So even if someone likes Sanders, some won\'t vote for him out of "anyone but a Republican" sentiment.\n\nI will be shocked if Sanders gets more than 25-30% of a significant state primary vote. It\'s not impossible, but I\'ll just be shocked (and I\'m tempted to say 15-20%).'
p1695
aS'The same thing was said about Obama being black. The question at the time was would America vote for a black man over a white woman. Now the question will be, will America vote for a Jewish man over a white woman. We are still trying to figure out if we are more racist or sexist.\n\nTo be fair Sanders has WAY less backing then Obama did. Clinton is the clear favorite right now. Things can still change this early thought. '

aS'Exactly. He could have even turned it into an attack on Hillary Clinton, because she voted for it.\n\n\nPres. Obama hammered Sen. McCain on it, and it helped him win.'
p1697
aS'Do you forget that Obama has bombed 7 countries? Libya is ruined. Pakistan is angrier than ever. Afghanistan is just waiting for us to leave so the Taliban can come back. Syria doesn\'t give a fuck. Somalia has not improved at all. Our allies in yemen have turned against us. Thia guys sucks at foreign policy and all the "liberal" was mongers want to blame bush for everything so they can absolve themselves of the moral guilt of voting for a violent psychopath who murdered 3000+ civilians with drone strikes in pakistan alone and **increased the "defense" spending every single year.** who deliberately disregarded the constitution in order to increase NSA spying by a factor of 10 since taking office.\n\nAs horrible as bush was, if you do the math, obama was actually worse.'
p1698
aS'I have no studies, just personal observations. That includes a large chunk of people who paid enough attention to Obama that they understand what they were voting for, or wouldn\'t be voting for. I wouldn\'t call it a hidden vote, but more of disillusioned vote. Obama wasn\'t a strong left wing candidate but a pretty meh candidate. The whole "Hope and Change" was more slogan than faith from what I personally saw.\n\nI think a lot chunk of the vote modivated by Obama was the black vote.\n\nI understand you think I overestimate how liberal the country is, though I have to disagree and I think you underestimate it.\n\nI do think Sanders will have trouble gathering votes; it\'s gonna be tough with the media not on his side.'

p1703
aS'I couldn\'t agree more. Hillary is entirely beholden to banks and corporations. The article dismisses Bernie as an also-ran, but gives him a little more coverage than, say, Faux News. \n\n\nA vote for Bernie (which he will get from me) may be a vote wasted, allowing a Republican to take the office, but really, there\'s no distinction except that, when a Democrat is in office, most "activists" stop caring and allow *their* candidate to do whatever he/she pleases. If a conservative was doing the things Obama has been doing (secret trade pacts, autocratically killing with drones, not legalizing weed, etc.), liberals would be shitting themselves.\n\n\nI realize that the potential for scary SCOTUS appointments are a major downside if the GOP wins, but I\'m trying to find a silver lining here. \n\n\nI liked the Norman Thomas quote, "I am not the champion of lost causes, but the champion of causes not yet won.'

Based on that I\'m not really sure why everyone is so "certain" about the contents of the TPP when it\'s not even done. Frankly just seems like a lot of political posturing right now on both sides. I\'m going to wait till I can actually learn what it is before I make up my mind on if I support or do not support.'
p1706
aS'I would argue that Warren and Sanders votes are interchangeable. A Warren endorsement would more than double Bernie\'s percentages, putting him in no worse a position against Hillary than where Obama was at the beginning of his primary run against an "inevitable" Hillary Clinton. If the party was capable of elevating a progressive in name only in \'08, it isn\'t that much of a stretch for them to nominate an actual progressive this time around.'
p1707
aS"Obama was a up and coming star for a while. He had relative youth and positive/fresh image on his side when against Hilary. Sander's in terms of image is the oppisite of Obama, but you know what, it could work for Sander's.

aS'Obama is absolutely correct - in an utterly useless way.\n\nThe failure of trust between police and local communities arises due to two major factors:\n\n1. The incessant "it\'s not your fault" message received by poor people that encourages them to externalize their problems.  That\'s not to say that poor people don\'t face institutional disadvantages.  But it isn\'t remotely in their self-interest to blame such disadvantages.  If poor people want to get ahead in life, the solution isn\'t to blame all the nebulous obstacles - but to figure out ways they can get around them.  Blame does not solve problems - which is why we go through this same cycle again and again.\n\n2. Police just uphold the laws they\'re required to uphold.  Most law enforcement officers are fairly decent sorts.  They - mentally - have a distinction in their mind between "laws we have to uphold" and "laws we\'re forced to uphold".  If you\'re selling loosies on the street, your average police officer will walk by without saying anything.  He understands that, while illegal, it isn\'t the kind of illegal he\'s *forced* to address.  But once a merchant starts complaining, the police officer is forced into a confrontation.  Police officers are not seeking out confrontation - they\'re engaging in the confrontations we forced them into by passing laws.\n\nYou can deal with one or the other of these issues.  But you can\'t just wish they didn\'t exist and pretend that nice words will make it all go away.'

And despite public appearances as a married couple and with a new grandchild, the specter of Bills constant and continuing sexual exploits is one such factor.\n\n&gt;This reflects on Hillary, as it begs the question of why Bill is constantly seeking sex outside of his marriage. Whats wrong with Hillary? And why didnt she divorce him years ago? The conclusion is that her ambitions, that it is her turn to be President, are driving her decisions.

Obama announced he was running on May 2 2007.  This week in May of 2007 he was trailing Hillary by 10 points.  Sanders, as of the latest polls I\'ve seen, show him trailing by 57 points.

He got a grass roots movement going that became unstoppable. All rural people get screwed by the government pretty badly. It wouldn't be hard to get them to vote for Sanders. There just aren't that many of them and if they work for a mine or pipeline, something like that, those companies send out propaganda advocating Republican candidates who will block legislation that would result in them losing their jobs. Most of the time those companies are the only real game in an area that will get you a reasonable standard of living.\n\nIt's a love-hate thing. Find an angle around that though, and they'd vote Democrat. Lotta old hippies out there in the middle of nowhere."

A charitable interpretation is that he wanted it to have more legitimacy (by being presented to and blessed by the country's elected body rather than just the President). \n\nThe less charitable interpretation is that  Obama knew they could never meet that condition and included it as a poison pill to scuttle the deal while providing himself with a face saving way to get the result he wanted from the start (we had to leave my hands were tied).\n\nIMHO people like Graham and McCain seem to have an overly optimistic memory of how great things were after the Surge. They always talk as if everything would be sunshine amd roses (like Germany or Japan or Korea 50 years after those wars ended) if we had only left some more troops behind. More likely we'd still be bogged down right in the middle of a civil war with no end in sight."

Obama has been president for nearly two terms. He decided to abandon Iraq. He supported the A-rab Spring. He destabilized Egypt, destroyed the regime in Lybia, failed to take timely action in Syria. The mounds of scorched human skulls are a monument to his incompetence and failure.\n\nThe result of this failure is in the news of the day. Blaming Bush is childlike and pointless. Obama inherited stability where now there is today carnage, chaos and catastrophe. Obama was elected to the office to do something besides golf and blame Bush.

aS"I can't believe people still try to use this narrative to discredit any politician. It was ultimately Bush's decision to go into Iraq, however, he hasn't been president for almost 8 years now, so it really is quite irrelevant. In the same way Bush still gets blamed for the economy today. It hasn't been his economy for almost 8 years.\nBut I suppose we want facts and truths. Then we need to actually look at those truths and not just what the government's media wants us to hear. I have many friends and relatives who were among the first infantryman to set foot in Iraq. It was a hard battle. And through tears and terror, and laughter and smiles, they would tell me the stories of what they saw over there. Sadam did have caches of chemical weapons throughout the country. Hundreds of them that were destroyed when our troops went over there. Chemical weapons he was still using on his own people. Obama bombed Lybia for doing just that same thing. No one seemed to have a problem with it. Did Sadam have nuclear weapons? No. No he did not. That was false information. Likely a lie. But the majority of the people of Iraq were beyond grateful to have US troops helping to free them from the oppression of Sadam. My cousin told me a story of a village they had searched. The people were so Tha kill for what the troops had done that they made a huge meal for the soldiers and had asked them to join the village elders for that meal. Three of my friends told me similar stories. How they were greeted by hoards of welcoming people every time they entered a village or town. Isn't that what the United States of America does? Free people from oppression? Except in our own country. But you wouldn't hear those stories in Ted Turner's Democratically controlled media because that wouldn't help the Democrats. \nThen there's the rhetoric that Sadam supported terrorism. Did he directly fund or was responsible for the 9/11 attacks? Maybe. Maybe not. There's no proof either way.  What we do know, however, is that he did in fact fund terrorist groups. And offered sanctuary to terrorist groups in Iraq. Throughout the many raids performed in Iraq by special forces groups, my cousin among the soldiers in these raids, they found a huge number of safe - houses that held different tools that were or would be used by terrorists (shoe bombs, book and briefcase bombs, plans, etc.). The reason these groups didn't take over Iraq as they are trying to do now, is because they had free reign. They didnt have to take over. They had a safe place to go to.\nOsama claimed in a video to attack the US because of our support of Iran during the Iran/Iraq war. That's fact. Gives credence to the idea that Sadam may have been a partner in it. \nThen is the argument that the Iraq war was about oil. It was. Fact. Whether right or wrong, the administration truly believed, especially after 9/11, that a terrorist state like Iraq controlling a huge piece of the world's oil would create domino effect and eventually lead to more middle eastern countries that control oil to fall under that ideation. That may not have been entirely accurate, but we've had similar reason for such large scale wars in the past. \nFact is, it's time to stop blaming Bush for all of our problems. The sub-par me mortgage crap was because of legislation put forth by Clinton. The average family makes near the same now as they did under Bush, but are on harder times. I actually make more now than then, and am.on harder times. Our defense budget is less and taxes higher now than under Bush, but we have a yearly deficit that is 3 and 4 times what his was during his administration. He may have been a bumbling idiot. No doubt. He was not a public speaker. But we did have lower gas prices."

aS"Interesting, I find it to be an incredibly frustrating time to be a conservative.  We're forced to consider absurd joke candidates as being 'serious contenders' who play to the extreme base yet are obviously unelectable.  It's openly acknowledged that running for the republican nomination is a great way to springboard into a well paying position on Fox News or the conservative speech circuit.\n\nWhat was supposed to be the driving philosophy behind the republican party, the neocon movement, has been completely discredited by the failures of the Bush administration.  But the only counter movement to form a new ideological direction for the party has been the Tea Party, which is an incoherent combination of knee-jerk anti-government libertarianism that borders on anarchism, and a pro-religious streak that borders on a push for theocracy.  All that's left animation the party is blind opposition to anything Obama says and does.\n\nI had some hope for Jeb as the 'sane' brother, but he's blown that out of the water with his support for W's policies and by surrounding himself with all the same advisers.  As for your three guys Walker's record in Wisconsin is very much mixed with a ton of people really hating him and almost as many fervent supporters.  He also has some issues with scandals, all politicians have scandals, but he's awful at addressing the concerns that the scandals about him raise.  He's extremely easy to paint as a pro-plutocrat guy.\n\nRubio may be more moderate than Cruz, but that isn't saying much.  I doubt his economic positions are as insane as they appear to be because he's obviously a smart guy, that means he's just going with the blind obstructionism of the rest of the party.  That isn't the move of a leader.  Also he's going to get hammered over the abortion issue as he's come out pretty strongly pro-life.\n\nPaul also has major issues as a candidate.  Not as badly as his father, with a Ron Paul supporter you can talk to them for about 5 minutes and everything they say will sound great.  Then when you hit minute 6 everything goes batshit insanity.  With Rand Paul you can generally go 15 minutes before you hit the crazy, but it's still there.  Which is unfortunate because I think he's the most interesting of the candidates and the one I'm most likely to support."

Too many people give him a pass for getting virtually nothing done his first two years, despite having a supermajority in Congress. \n\nI voted for him twice, but this is wishful revisionist history. Obama has been a right)leaning moderate for most of his Presidency, it is only recently, now that he has no more elections to win, that he has begun to voice a semblebce of a liberal agenda. He shouldn't get a pass for that. I voted for him and I am the first to say he has been a monumental disappointment, as all politicians end up being. \n\nSanders is the least politician-like politician I've ever seen, and he has my vote already, but I am not deluded. I have high expectations and when they aren't met I don't give them a pass or ignore it, and neither should anyone else."

aS"This is pretty basic strategy for everyone running to be the Republican nominee. They have to win the nomination and there's no mystery about what positions they need to hold to do it. It's a list of checkboxes because the voters have been polled endlessly. \n\nWho knows what his true personal beliefs are. Would anyone be shocked if he was only saying this because the number of votes he wins (e.g. with older voters) are greater than the number of votes he'll lose?\n\nLet's not forget that candidate Obama was just as against homosexual marriage. It was only when Biden forced his hand that he came out in favor of it. Does anyone doubt that he was cool with it the whole time and his position was one of political expediency?\n\nI don't mean to make this sound like I'm making excuses for him. I'm not. I'm just incapable of being outraged over such an obvious must-have Republican position. "
p1797
aS"Is that an argument? I'm not the president. \n\nI'll tell you what I haven't done: I haven't backed off my criteria for what constitutes respectable behavior for the president. I haven't warmed up to blank checks to kill American citizens, punishing whistleblowers who acted courageously and in good faith, or refusal to prosecute white collar criminals. I didn't have to wait for public opinion to change before supporting gay marriage. I don't need to be convinced that civil asset forfeiture is unjust and unAmerican, or that cops should never be the ones in charge of investigating and prosecuting other cops, and that building trust between cops and citizens can't and won't begin until they're subject to the same rules and the same punishment when those rules are broken. \n\nI could go on.... I can't help notice that you didn't take the opportunity to list all the courageous things Obama has done, and/or all the instances of bold leadership. Or even just one. "
p1798
aS"Do you even realize how much Obama has accomplished while in office? Troops leaving Iraq/Afghanistan. The Affordable Care Act. Healing the economy. \n\nHonestly you act like he's been a lame duck president for 8 years due to bipartisan stubbornness. Reality couldn't be farther from that.\n\nEdit: People keep thinking I'm saying these are good things. I'm not. I'm also not saying they're bad things. My point was simply that he set out to accomplish these things while campaigning, and he was able to achieve these goals. Some of these things he accomplished with the support of Congress, and some of these things he accomplished when Congress failed to prevent them. The point is that he hasn't been a completely inert and unproductive president. "

aS'That\'s right. What is not possible is to be a good guy and do all the lying, cheating, and stealing Obama has done during the last 6 years all to be capped off by trying to give us "free" trade run entirely by corporations. I see your point. But it\'s kinda sad that you even make a comment that in a way defends a guy like this.\n\nI used the word "still" because this type of scumbag stuff just keeps piling up. I was just wondering if anyone hadn\'t figured it out yet. \nBush=Clinton=Bush=Obama'

You don't have to agree with someone on everything. You will be better off dealing with an honest person than a scumbag.\n\nAlso, Obama was against gay marriage until like 1.5 years ago! Double standard much? Give Ron a chance. Watch the video I linked to. Actually listen to Ron talk himself instead of assuming you know what he stands for.\n\nOn your other post, gay rights have come a long way. But not because of Obama because he was against it until like 2013 or somewhere around there. He's a chump. Not a leader. Ron Paul was for equal rights for everyone. Gay or not. Government out of marriage. That's how it should be. Government not involved at all.\n\nRon had a better more liberal opinion than Obama and held that position decades before Obama finally switched over from BEING AGAINST IT. Ron was never against it, except for religiously, and that was the great thing about Ron Paul, he didn't believe on enforcing his beliefs on anyone and he never tried to."

Many don't want to be associated with that. Morally or they actually accept facts. \n\nSome Republicans don't believe everything they read and see, though. Those are the good ones. They may be Republicans, but they see through a lot of the bullshit. They just lean more right on some things, so they identify as a Republican. They believe in legalizing pot, accept the facts on climate change, and Obama is an American Citizen. "

And if you look back 4 more years to 2004, George W Bush used gay marriage as a wedge issue to win the reelection of his presidency. So yes, only one election cycle later it makes sense why politicians would be cagey to publicly support it. FWIW in 2007 Hillary was for full rights via Civil Unions."

Obama readily ruins millions of lives by keeping them in jail and continuing to jail more. His own black brothers mostly!

That\'s why they are better. Smaller, less powerful assholes in power. No one said it was perfect or even close. But you don\'t get 15 years in the middle east and a housing bubble to the tune of 15 trillion except through massive federal power. So the idea is to limit it the power centers.\n\nThat\'s why the founders made the country with about a million safeguards against consolidation of power. Because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely (Lord Acton). So they set out to limit the power one person can hold.\n\nAs we see now. Obama has unlimited power to set up international trade deals and he\'s using it. That\'s what happens, so you try to avoid it. You at least understand the logic right?\n\nALSO, did you read your own wiki article? Ron Paul says specifically in the quote "Ridiculous as sodomy laws may be..."\n\nRon argues from a constitutional perspective all the time. You have to read the entirety of what he says.

Opposition party leaders blocking Presidents' goals is fairly common. While I agree it is pointless and stupid, it is the reality we have to work with. Obama is at least partically to blame for the disaster that was the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nAdditionally, what little legislation he did get through that Congress was bad (IMO at least) and did nothing to help make his case to the American people. Fact is, he squandered the best opportunity the liberal agenda has ever had and he HAS to answer for that at some point, I'm tired of seeing liberals and democrats giving him a pass for this. "
p1813
aS"Are you trying not to get it? States are just little feds. It's the same on a smaller scale. They force people to do stuff with guns. The federal government persecutes entire populations and communities with the drug war. It's far worse than anything gays are dealing with. You can't run to Cali to get away from Obama and his cages.\n\nIt is pathetic to see you trash Ron Paul and ignore the disgusting behavior of Obama. At least be consistent.You are bungling Ron's opinions, but even if you were correct about Ron, those same ideals should by all rights make you totally despise Obama.\n\nRon Paul doesn't think the government has any constitutional authority to regulate marriage. He says everyone has the same rights.\n\nSo Ron Paul wants to free all the political prisoners Obama is holding and protect EVERYONE'S rights. It's not a right to be married by the government or a church or anyone. It's a private matter spiritual matter that assholes in state and federal governments have attempted to usurp for political gain.\n"

aS"These comments on reddit responding to your perfectly fair question are exactly why Obama has felt frustrated with the arguments against TPP.

It's because countries who have finally spent months working out the details aren't going to just deal with the political theater of demands and amendments that a politician may just feel like throwing out there last second. Up and down vote - its the only way to deal with an agreement across so many countries. "

aS'Before I dismiss a Biden candidacy out of hand I will say that Biden, generally speaking, polls well as a good "second choice" (better than Bernie Sanders most days) if only because people know who he is. But Biden has two (and a half) big things working against him.\n\nOne, he\'s old. If elected to the presidency he would be 74 years old on inauguration day, which is 4 years older than the next oldest president sword into a first term (Reagan was 2 weeks shy of his 70th birthday on his inauguration day). If he served two terms, he\'d be 82 when the next President was sworn in. And while his mother may have lived to be 93 and his dad may have lived to be 87, the average life span for a healthy American male is 76. That means he\'d almost certainly be a one term president, and the Democrats can\'t really take that risk. (Hillary on the other hand will be just over 69 on inauguration day with a life expectancy of about 82. Bernie Sanders meanwhile is already 73 and will be 75 on inauguration day.)\n\nOne half is that he\'s Obama\'s VP. Obama is popular among Democrats but wildly unpopular among independents and conservatives. Hillary can distance herself somewhat from Obama\'s domestic agenda and his politics because she was the chief diplomat and she\'s been out of office for a couple of years. Biden meanwhile has been there the whole time in lockstep (publicly, at least) with Obama\'s agenda the whole time. The public wants a new president with new ideas. They don\'t want an Obama third term.\n\nBut Joe Biden\'s biggest problem is Joe Biden. And by that I mean the tenuous connection that his brain has with his mouth. Sometimes he\'s on fire (he basically destroyed Rudy Giuliani\'s campaign in 2008 with his "a noun, a verb and 9/11" schtick) but more often than not he\'s having to put out fires he set himself by making the mistake of telling people what he really thinks. He\'s the kind of guy who\'d put his foot in his mouth and and then try to fix it by shooting himself in it. (Oh and don\'t get the gun folks started on Biden. If he runs the NRA will have a commercial with Joe\'s greatest hits playing 24/7 throughout the campaign.) \n\nSo yeah if you look at the polls it looks like Joe might have a chance but any "pull" he might have now is based solely on name recognition now would likely evaporate once a few serious contenders enter the race.'

aS'&gt;     Iraq/Afghanistan\n&gt; \n&gt; Every time I hear this in a good light its Obama that did it! Whenever anyone brings up how ISIS easily came to power they all just say "Oh well it was Bush\'s timeline"\n\nSo? Bush **started** the war, Obama **ended** it. Huge difference. ISIS is still a concern but obviously not on the same level of STARTING AN WAR THAT KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENTS (for what reason)?\n\n&gt;     Healing the economy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The economy is doing better but only the rich seem to be getting richer(see wealth gap). The middle class has had pretty much 0 growth since he took office. More people on SNAP than ever before.\n\nStrawman. Income inequality has been plaguing the country for 70+ years. This is specifically about correcting Bush\'s overspending and tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n\n&gt;     6 years due to bipartisan stubbornness.\n&gt; \n&gt; FTFY. Dems had house and senate control the first two years he was in office. Why didn\'t more stuff get done then?\n\nNo. This circlejerk has been refuted countless times. They only had a supermajority for narrow window and used that political capital on the ACA. "20/20 hindsight" is a bullshit criticism no one takes seriously. Why didn\'t **YOU** lead a better life? See, I proved you\'re dumb.'
p1827
aS"&gt; It's possible he's listening to those who disagree\n\nIf that's the case, then Obama isn't being honest in his public statements.

Seems like the big jumps under [Clinton](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/inequality.png) though. Yeah Bush it went up but not near as much as while Clinton was in.\n\n&gt; No. This circlejerk has been refuted countless times. They only had a supermajority for narrow window and used that political capital on the ACA.\n\nBy saying they had a super majority to pass the ACA you are already wrong about 8 years of bipartisan stubbornness.

We don't need rulers and we certainly don't need kings over all the land as Bush and Obama have become.\n\nThe abuses of the federal government far outweigh the combined abuses of all state governments by many times.

This is not lying either as people actually thought this. To say that people weren't saying that would have been a lie.\n\nSecondly, it is not a stretch when considering Jebs comments that children should be raised by a dad and a mom under the context of appealing for conservative support for the primaries that he is taking an anti-gay stance. Why specify the gender of the parents if he was not trying to make this point? \n\nOPs article is clearly sensationalizing what he said (no one is arguing that it doesn't), but to say this wasn't an anti-gay marriage statement is a stretch."

aS'It is not absurd and unethical that no one is asking Clinton or Sanders about this. Why? Because Sanders is the only Independent who *voted against the Iraq invasion* back when they were voting on it, and Clinton\'s position was heavily considered in the 2008 primaries. This very question was a centerpiece Obama\'s original campaign. They are both on record on this topic. Jeb is not, because he has no voting record, and no one had ever asked him before. \n\nWe\'re discussing it because the vast majority of Americans feel that it was a colossal mistake that cost countless lives, destabilized the Middle East, and allowed both Al Qaeda to grow and ISIS to form. Jeb is surrounding himself with advisers from his brother\'s administration who are still actively arguing that the war was necessary, that taking out Saddam was a greater good anyway, and that the current issues were caused by Obama. So, it is entirely reasonable that people would be interested to know whether he has a similar position to his advisers. Asking someone of their position "knowing what he now know" is a softball question, because most of us consider the answer to be fairly obvious. The fact that he couldn\'t get it right is evidence that the question needed to be asked.'

I agree, the article is clickbaitish, but we must expect more. \n\nRegarding the marriage statistic, you\'re right, I used that as that go-to "well half of all marriages" thing. Here\'s some statistics on marriage:\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage_divorce_tables.htm\n\nOn first glance, I\'m noticing 2 trends: divorce is on the decline, and so too is marriage.

I suppose we can blame everything on the bad cop and imagine that if only if the good cop had total power none of this would ever happen, but I think the reality is that the good cop and the bad cop are always essentially working together. \n\nThe system works on faith, we have faith that our politicians are doing everything they can to move things in our favor, in the direction we believe in, but because of this "good cop, bad cop" routine, we can never be sure what the real motives were behind all of the compromises and policy choices that went against stated values. I think it is because we have so little to go on but faith that politics has become little more than a popularity and personality contest. We hope Obama is a good person, we hope Clinton is, but we don\'t really know because everything they do is interpreted in the shadow of the "good cop, bad cop" routine. They are just the good cop trying to make the best of a situation largely driven by the bad cop we reason.

In fact, Inquirer reporters had a tough time tracking down any registered Republicans in these areas.\n&gt; To be clear, these districts make up a small subset of all of Philadelphia.

aS"Consider Obamacare. Was the final bill exactly the ideal one that Obama originally submitted? Absolutely not, he had to make a lot of concessions along the way to get the right to agree to pass it. It could be a lot better, and it was a lot better in its original inception.\n\nBut the point is that Obamacare in its current iteration is better than nothing at all. Is it ideal? No. But if Obama hadn't compromised at all on any points then it would never have passed, and we would have gotten no progress instead of some progress.\n\nAnd while Obama had a more favorable congress and senate at the time ACA passed, he didn't have such an overwhelming majority that they could push anything they wanted through. Compromise is necessary to get anything passed, no matter the state of congress or the senate.\n\nAlso, you have to remember that Sanders also had a left-wing government when Obama passed the ACA, and yet Sanders was unable to pass anything then either.\n\nSo while you're right that the current republican-dominated government does explain Sanders' (or any left-wing legislator's) inability to pass anything now, it does not explain his inability to pass anything *even when we had a democrat-dominated government* in the past.\n\nHe has not shown the ability to compromise or propose reasonable bills that garner enough support from both sides of the aisle to pass, no matter who is in control of the government. That's concerning, at least to me, because no matter who is in charge of the government, the fact remains that you *must* compromise to pass anything."

aS"&gt;you should be asking yourself is if it's better to attempt to represent the voters, even if it means proposing bills that have little chance of passing\n\nHow does proposing legislation that won't pass benefit anyone?\n\nConsider Obamacare. The ACA is far from a perfect solution, in large part due to the changes Obama was forced to make in order to get enough support from the right to get the bill passed.\n\nSo my question is, is the ACA better than nothing? I think yes. Because even though the original ACA bill, prior to republican concessions, is certainly better than the current iteration of the ACA, there is 0 chance in hell the original ACA bill passes.\n\nSo I think that the current ACA, albeit cut down due to concessions, is better than the nothing we would have if Obama refused to compromise.\n\nThe same principle applies to all bills. A bill that passes but is not ideal due to concessions made to the opposite side to get enough support is superior, in my mind, to a bill that is ideal but did not pass because the legislators were unwilling to compromise. \n\nA step that is actually made in the right direction is better than a leap in the right direction that never takes place."

For example in one precinct in Little Rock, Arkansas, Barack Obama managed 474 votes and Mitt Romney zero. Two additional votes were cast for other candidates.\n\n&gt; Romney also is shown to have received zero votes in 22 precincts in Dallas, 22 precincts in New Orleans, 9 precincts in Birmingham, Alabama, 7 precincts in Gary, Indiana (adjacent to Chicago), 6 precincts in Louisville, Kentucky and 3 precincts in Baton Rouge.\n\n&gt; Even in the deepest red states, there were precincts (predominately urban and African-American) where Romney's message fell so flat that it appears he was not even able to scrape up a single vote. Even in Oklahoma, one of Obama's worst states, one precinct reportedly went 606-3 for Obama and he carried several other large precincts with over 97 percent of the vote.\n\nTexas investigated the vote and found no evidence of fraud.

You\'ve got quite the gish gallop of pedestrian concerns that you\'ve expended exactly no effort in actually thinking about critically (meaning considering both sides). \n\n&gt;  I can\'t help notice that you didn\'t take the opportunity to list all the courageous things Obama has done,\n\nBecause I\'m already confident that he is a top 15 president of all time. I mean, I could link you to http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/ but I\'m guessing you\'ve seen it. \n\n&gt; and/or all the instances of bold leadership. \n\nIn my estimation, he is more thoughtful and brave than you will ever be. That said, I don\'t need someone gambling with the country\'s future to prove how manly and "bold" they are. It is enough for me that he saved the country. And what have you done, other than bitch about it?'

aS"I guarantee your old plan was not way better. \n\nBecause if it legitimately was. You'd still be on it. Plans that conformed with the ACA existed prior to the ACA. Plans with low oop expenses and no lifetime maximums. They still exist and the people who were on them didn't even notice a change. \n\nLikely your old plan was made illegal because it exceeded the annual out of pocket expense maximum set by the ACA which is now around 6,000. \n\nLikely your old plan had a lifetime maximum coverage amount. Meaning that after a week in the ICU. You would have used all of your insurance benefits and be on your own financially for the rest. At about 200 dollars a minute not including the drugs. \n\nYour plan was made illegal because it was shit. And if you got really hurt, you would have been like most people who get sick with shit insurance. Filing chapter 11 bankruptcy. \n\nBut blame Obama. He is the badguy. Not the company that sold you a product knowing full well it would not work when you really needed it too. They actually designed it to not work when you really needed it too. \n\nPersonally I wish that people like you could opt out of the ACA. On the provision that you forfeit your right to file bankruptcy when you incur 800,000 in medical bills. You should be allowed to be permanently and cripplingly indebted for the rest of your natural life. "

aS"I was talking about the electorate nationally. Add up all the people regardless of location and look at their votes.\n\nIn 2010 the GOP rode the Tea Party wave into the House. I think that movement was the last gasp of the right, and it arose from good reasons (Washington doesn't give a shit what the people say) and some bad reasons (There's a n****r in the White House that is doing more than sweeping). Did you see pictures of them? Mostly old people. That hurts because old people die at a much higher rate than young people.\n\nGerrymandering helps a bunch as well.\n\nNow, look at OWS. Mainly young people. They are going to be around much longer.\n\n2012 Obama was handily reelected.\n\n2014 the Senate changed hands, yes, but those results were predicted in 2012 because the states holding senatorial races skew right. As much as the overall population is changing, some places (Texas) were far more conservative than others to start with, so of course it will take longer for the leftward trend to become apparent.\n\nAnd the punditry predicted it would change hands again in 2016 for the same reasons.\n\nAn aging right wing combined with a growing liberal movement and an increasing Latino vote which we'll remembers who called for mass deportations and who wanted immigration reform guarantees that the GOP is caught in a trap that is hard to get out of.\n\nCan't take the White House until their ideas mesh with the electorate. Can't change position and still get the nomination.\n\nYou can see it in recent attempts by conservative politicians in Texas endorsing the notion of marijuana legalization. They know they have to appeal to voters younger than 65, but the main body of their party violently opposes anything that those younger voters find appealing."

Obama's support for the destruction of Libya proves the opposite and Iran took note.\n\n- 2) I would not allow Turkey to ignore the Kurds into oblivion, nor would I support Turkish leadership to the extent Obama has and I would promote a more secular government in that country.\n\n- 3) I would not have insisted on political reforms in the civilian government of Iraq as a precondition for aid (as Obama did)\n\n- 4) Without weapons, and with US aid, 10,000 US troops would have been enough to keep ISIS under control so Syria could have crushed them. In fact, I might have offered Assad some help in a effort to win him over from Russia's grasp. That would have been a good thing too. "

aS'&gt;The collapse in the Middle East feels like Black April, 1975, the month South Vietnam fell. And it should, because just as the collapse of Saigon did not happen in Black April, but in a political American decision to allow South Vietnam to fall after a decent interval, so also is the ongoing collapse rooted, not in the recent tactical mistakes of the White House, but in the grand strategic decision president Obama made when he assumed office.\n\n&gt;This is the plan.  It would be crazy not to acknowledge it. To effectively combat ISIS  or whatever it morphs into next   president Obama would essentially have to retrace his steps and return to a posture very much like that of George W. Bush. But that would mean starting a 500 kilometer march eating crow every step of the way and hes not going to do it.\n\n&gt;Deep in their hearts the Washington Post and the New York Times must realize they endorsed Obama precisely because they knew that when this moment came he would harden his heart and refuse to re-engage, except for show.  Since this is the plan,  the only effective strategy, the only sane thing to do is to accept the liberal gambit and continue it.\n\n&gt;The obvious continuation is not to dampen the sectarian conflict, but to exacerbate it to the greatest degree possible. America, like Britain in the Napoleonic age, should adopt the policy of supporting first one side then the other, or preferably both at once, so that the combatants inflict the maximum degree of damage on each other.\n\n&gt;To be perfectly fair to president Obama, the  weapon of sectarian warfare was originally the brainchild of Abu Musab Zarqawi. Aided ironically by the Iranians, Zarqawi sponsored attacks on the Shiite population because Tehran cynically calculated a civil war would loosen the grip of the United States on post-Saddam Iraq.  The idea was that when America withdrew  Zarqawis gang  and Iran  would inherit the carpet of bodies.\n\n&gt;By an extraordinary effort of will America beat the civil war back temporarily,  cementing it together with the the trust that people used to have in the good old USA , perhaps for the last time in history, forming a coalition in what was known as the Surge. But it did not last. With Obamas 2008 election, it was plain to the wicked and cunning old men in Turkey and Tehran that he would throw it away and that the conflict would continue as soon as he withdrew and they could inherit what was left.\n\n&gt;The British empire in its heyday would have understood the logic perfectly. Thats how it advanced, setting one potentate against the other, one tribe against the next. But the American liberal elite was psychologically unable to follow the implications of their own handiwork to its logical conclusion, any more than they could acknowledge the boat people or victims of the Khmer Rouge were somehow connected to a support for Ho Chi Minh.  And so they pretended and temporized and spun and lied, until the time for lies was over.\n\n&gt;To a cynic, what follows next is quite simple:  to be the winner stand back and watch while the Arabian peninsula, Levant and North Africa destroys itself. Take every opportunity to make it worse. Clearly a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented scale will result. Hundreds of thousands are already dead and millions of displaced persons are on the road. That will only grow in scale and number to millions of dead and tens of millions of refugees.  Therefore steps like preparing to sink the people smuggling boats, as the EU is doing, are in order.\n\nRead more: http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2015/05/19/the-road-to-damnation/#ixzz3ah7iN3lU\n'

Grew, and only because they're hot button topics they went underground. \n\n&gt;And torture wasn't rubber stamped by both parties, so much as crafted by the Cheney camp and endorsed by the GOP after the fact to support their guy.\n\nYou really need to read what happened during the Obama administration, his direct approval and approvals by his direct reports. \n\nThat kind of thing doesn't just happen by magic. \n\nSure, a lot of it started and grew much bigger than its previous iteration, but if it's such a mistake and ugly and wrong, then why did Obama continue most and continues to maintain these policies? They never stopped. If everything Bush did was bullshit then why are we still doing it? There are fresh signature next to the approvals. Dated. Notarized. Complicit and responsible. \n\nNow you may argue the president shouldn't be personally liable since he was doing the best he can, or based on information at hand, or any other excuse.

In 2008 I wasn't glad Obama won, but for letting Bush get away with murder for 8 years I felt a loss was just what they deserved. In 2016 I feel the Democrats have earned a loss for the same reason.

Besides, Israeli spies stole nuclear secrets from the US during the Manhattan Project and won't declare their arsenal, which is against international law.  \n\nAlso, what does Obama have to do with any of this?  He (and other Western allies) have been looking for a peaceful, diplomatic solution to this manufactured problem for years with a rather arrogant coercive diplomatic strategy that seems condescending to Iran.

Okay, maybe he hasn't engaged in boots on the ground combat operations like Bush, but most policy analysts now agree that boots on the ground combat operations are spectacularly ill-suited to addressing the crises of the present. Obama is extremely hawkish in his expansion of all sorts of different alternative warfare strategies, especially drone strikes and covert operations.

It's known that boots on the ground does not work at all to wage a counterinsurgency, and so the closest thing you'd get with a neocon would be MAYBE some more advisors and a few soldiers in Iraq to help fight IS. \n\nOur western alliances were tarnished under the Bush admin., sure. And I agree that that has gotten much better under the Obama administration. And probably the Iran and Cuba talks would never have happened with a neocon. \n\nIt so happens that many of our democratic allies also have centrist-right leaders with more aggressive ideas about how to deal with the Middle East, so the USA's drone program may have some support. STILL does not discount the observation that Obama has simply transformed the war. The War on Terror still rages on, and Obama has expanded it in many ways. Also, his foreign policy is extremely aggressive, just without the boots on the ground component. Authorizing completely detached airstrikes during foreign crises a la Bosnia and Kosovo is not a diplomatic solution, nor is it a constructive one. It's a show of force and an extension of the greater war that America continues to fight."

Everything we do with drones we use to do, with less precision with military bombing sorties.

Paul and Lee didn't vote for her specifically because of asset forfeiture, and Cruz didn't vote for her because of her use of prosecutorial discretion. \n\n\nIf anything Democrats should have used that opportunity to show some bipartisanship.

Warren basically called Republicans sexist for holding up her nomination, and Sanders rubber stamped her nomination without question, while criticizing Republicans who stood up for their beliefs, while going against his.\n\nThe only reason banks are getting away with BS, is because the Democratic party rubber stamps everything Obama does, instead of actually questioning things he does that goes against their beliefs."

Two things:\n\n-------------\n\nOne, the article makes clear this is only in regards to the early primary season. So the comments here about how she\'ll "eventually need them" are doing a good job at missing the point. The article is arguing that she doesn\'t need the validity and name recognition that the media can provide and she\'s not going to "feed the beast" at this point because of how she feels about the media. \n\n&gt; She felt burned by the coverage of Clinton White House scandals and was convinced the media\'s affection for Barack Obama played a significant role in her defeat in the 2008 presidential primary\n\n----------\n\nTwo, the other interesting thing on the topic (that the article doesn\'t mention) is the clear perception that Clinton will win the primary easily. Contrary to what you\'d be led to believe in /r/politics, the polls look SIGNIFICANTLY better for Clinton than they did in \'08 and it looks nearly impossible for Clinton to lose this. I could go into this further, but I already wrote a good (but rather dumbed down) post on this a while back ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/35iqik/bernie_sanders_i_can_beat_hillary_clinton/cr4v24t)).\n\nAnyway, I think the media will be hesitant to levy serious attacks at her because of this at this early time.

Instead, kids  can "afford" it if their loan is guaranteed.  This lets universities get away with charging 50k a year for college, where in a normal market, lack of demand at the price-point of 50k would force the price much lower.  \n\nSame reason the housing bubble started.  Federally guaranteed mortgages to people who weren\'t qualified, leads to false demand and then inflation... and then eventually bursts when they start defaulting.  In the case of the housing market the trading of derivatives exacerbated the problem. Despite what Obama tells you, trading derivatives was not the root cause of the housing bubble, guaranteed mortgages to people who weren\'t qualified is.\n\n\n&gt;Why does most of the developed world pull it off then?\n\nMost of the developed world goes to public university heavily subsidized by tax payers.

"That\'s not what he says, of course, but that\'s the result of his policies."\n\n&gt;Rather than focusing on carbon emissions, Bush said, the federal government should provide more incentives for lower carbon-producing forms of energy, like hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling.\n\n&gt;"I don\'t think it\'s the highest priority.

If you are on the left, guess what?  Your view of what's far left and the view of someone in the actual center are going to be different.\n\n&gt;Again, by actual voting record, McCain was in the center of all Republicans in the Senate.

The guy wanted to keep us in Iraq for 100 years, give even more tax breaks to the rich and issue a standard national sales tax to make up for it, all while slashing entitlements to pay for an increase in military spending.  This was his platform, it was neocon through and through, total far right cornucopia of conservative policies.\n\nActually, voting records should be what we go on when deciding our candidates, so I thank you for that link.

aS'On one hand W Bush started the whole Iraq thing and the stuff related to it.\n\nOn the other hand Obama campaigned on removing troops from Iraq and made sure to do just that.  It was not until this happened that ISIS formed and started its campaign of conquering cities and so on.  \n\nYou cannot in blame W without also blaming Obama, if you are to blame either of them.  The reps did dumb shit like start a war in the middle east.  The dems did dumb shit like remove troops letting terror factions take over, or not having adequate security at embassies.  Right now its a campaign from both sides to show the other as militarily and strategically ignorant and bad, when the reality is both have fucked up and done dumb shit.  \n\nPersonally if we can\'t say "both are at fault" I\'d have to blame Obama over W Bush.  This mostly comes down to the fact that the rift that changes AQI to ISIL and broke them off from AQ was directly related to Obama and the assassination of Bin Laden.  Then combine this with the removal of troops in Iraq, and it shows a real lack of foresight for what could occur on the part of Obama and/or his advisory staff.  '

aS'The publicly stated "reason" that Obama chose to not leave troops in Iraq was that Iraqis refused to give the proposed troops immunity from Iraqi prosecution.  However note that an Iraqi effort to prosecute our troops in Iraq would (or *should*) be farcical in that we would (or *should*) refuse to cooperate, refuse to hand over the defendants to them, and likely ship the defendants home.  \n\nSo you decide if Obama wanted or didn\'t want to leave troops in Iraq, because he chose not to, as per Bush\'s withdrawl plan.  Had Obama left troops in there, more Americans would be dead and ISIS would hold less territory.  As the occupying power and victor in the most recent war, Obama could do as he pleased.  He wasn\'t physically bound by Bush\'s agreement or by negotiations with Iraqis - he could have just left troops there and chose not to.  Live with it; he does.\n\n'

The peoples of the Middle East are very tribal. They were since Ancient Rome *occupied* them - **hundreds** of years before Islam. The differing Islamic sects are just an extension of that tribalism. The wars they fought were tribal and had more to do with land and water than with religion. The wars they are fighting are also tribal.  Framing the conflicts there as Islamic based shows a very shallow understanding of the region and her peoples. But, that is what sells here in America - ignorance.\n\n2. Saddam Hussein kept order. Brutally. He was overthrown and killed by George W. Bush. This allowed ISIS,IS, or whatever their name Du Jour is to rise up. \n\n3. We are yet another Western power that has invaded and occupied *their* land. The reason is irrelevant. The US troops are occupiers. \n\n4. It's *all* about oil when it comes down to it.

It is not a strawman to say that we need to choose our language carefully so that we are not using the same exaggerations that people who are rejecting science are using.  Nor did I suggest that the Earth would crumble into dust, but rather I am suggesting that we will not even destroy all life on Earth with our actions, instead, we will destroy our ability to live here.\n\nYour example of "Obama is destroying America" is a great example of the hyperbole that I am suggesting that we should avoid so that we can actually communicate the actual concerns without being dismissed as alarmist.\n\nFurther, the anthropocentric use of language, while certainly understandable, given we are humans, does affect our thinking.  Essentially, how we choose to talk affects how we think.  By choosing language that avoids the anthropocentric, we stop thinking in terms of "we\'re the center of the universe, and we are all that matters.'

aS'&gt;For example, Guantanamo Bay.\n\nPick a better example.

That\'s when the bill preventing funds from being used to house or try non-combatants on US soil were pushed through the Congress.\n\nObama tried to close Guantanamo, Congress kept it open. \n\nDo you realize that even now, there are multiple GOP bills in Congress to prevent Obama from closing Guantanamo?\n\nH.R. 401: Detaining Terrorists to Protect America Act of 2015\n\n"To extend and enhance prohibitions and limitations with respect to the transfer or release of individuals detained at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba..."\n\nH.R. 654: Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Protection Act\n\nPrevents closure of Guantanamo.\n\nH.R. 1689: To prohibit the provision of certain foreign assistance to countries receiving certain detainees transferred from United ...\n\nPrevents Obama from using the federal funds that paid for the release of previous detainees to prevent more detainees from being released. \n\nAnd there is of course the NDAA.\n\n"Sec. 1036.

aS'Alright...you will not read the article, so I will bring it to you.\n\n************************************************\n\n.\n\n\nWhat happens when the public does not wish to live out the utopian dreams of its elite leaders? Usually, the answer for those leaders is to seek more coercion and less liberty to force people to think progressively.\n\nHere at home, President Obama came into power in 2009 with a Democratic Congress, a sympathetic press and allies in Hollywood, academia, unions and philanthropic and activist foundations.\n\nYet all that support was not sufficient to ensure "correct" public attitudes about Obama\'s agenda on health care, entitlements, taxes, guns, abortion and cultural issues.\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats forfeited their majority in the House. In the 2014 midterms, they lost their Senate majority and also lost ground in state legislatures and with governorships across the country. Since early 2013, Obama\'s approval rating has been consistently below 50%.\n\nHow, then, do politically correct planners force the people to think and act properly when they push back?\n\nExtra-legal executive orders can help a president bypass supposed troglodytes in Congress and among the public.\n\nObama granted blanket amnesties, proposed rules that would lead to the closure of many coal plants and arbitrarily chose which health or labor statutes should be enforced and at what times.\n\nA filmmaker was even jailed on a trumped-up probation charge after making a video about Islam that was deemed unhelpful to the official administration Benghazi narrative. The IRS hounded nonprofit groups considered insufficiently progressive.\n\nIn a recent rant about conservative Fox News  which has a fraction of the combined audience of the liberal networks ABC, CBS and NBC  Obama warned that the media are going to have change the very way they report news.\n\nPresumably, Obama believes that Fox tricks the unknowing masses into thinking wrong thoughts, especially about the relationship between the poor and government assistance.\n\nAs Obama put it: "We\'re going to have to change how our body politic thinks, which means we\'re going to have to change how the media reports on these issues, and how people\'s impressions of what it\'s like to struggle in this [economy looks like."\n\nGiven the First Amendment, how can the president "change" the media? Should the Federal Communications Commission pick and choose acceptable news outlets in the same manner that Lois Lerner ran her exempt-organizations division at the IRS? Who would judge whether the media had changed to meet Obama\'s notion of correctness?\n\nHillary Clinton is worried that too many people have incorrect thoughts about feminist issues. For those who oppose abortion, Clinton believes that these supposedly wrong thoughts must be policed. "Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases," she warned, "have to be changed."\n\nHow, in a free society, does Clinton plan to alter the way religion and culture work? What power would she need to rid us of these "deep-seated" but unhelpful "codes and beliefs"?\n\nClinton recently declared that if elected president, she would pick Supreme Court nominees by the litmus test of demanding that they oppose the Citizens United ruling. She is apparently still furious at the high court\'s 2010 decision that dismantled federal election rules restricting independent political expenditures by nonprofit organizations.\n\nCitizens United, remember, was a conservative nonprofit group that produced an unflattering movie about Clinton. The Federal Election Commission went to court to prevent the film from airing on TV before the 2008 Democratic primaries. In other words, Clinton wishes to judge the qualifications of future Supreme Court nominees on whether they agree a nonprofit organization had no right to be critical of her in a documentary at election time.\n\nIf Clinton is really worried about the role of big money in politics, she would have done better to have insisted that the Clinton Foundation did not solicit donations from foreign governments while she was the secretary of state.\n\nShe might have ensured that her family\'s foundation distributed 90% of its expenditures -- instead of a reported 10%  directly to the charities it claimed to help, especially given that it has raised close to $2 billion.\n\nClinton might also have blasted former presidents seeking hefty lecture fees and family foundation donations from wealthy entrepreneurs who hope to buy access and influence from either a sitting secretary of state, a former president  or a future president.\n\nOr, Clinton herself might have cut back on lucrative speaking fees, often paid by wealthy corporations seeking influence. Bill and Hillary Clinton have pulled in $30 million in lecture cash in just the last 16 months. Mysteriously, the closer Clinton got to announcing her bid for the presidency, the more frequent and the more lucrative the Clinton duo\'s lecturing became.\n\nWhen news organizations, judges or Americans in general do not think or speak in the correct fashion, then elite progressives believe they must do whatever is necessary to silence them  while making themselves exempt from their own agendas.\n\n\n\n\n'

aS'In what ways did W Bush personally make money from the invasion of Iraq?  You brought this up before, I asked before, you still haven\'t answered yet still make this claim.  \n\nWhen W Bush left office Iraq was stabilizing, it was looking better, and things were generally going well.  Then Obama was in office, he did something notably capturing/killing Bin Laden.  ISIS then went on to gain power and do its own thing, meanwhile Obama did nothing but continue his troop scale backs.\n\nISIS has a long history, not always known as ISIS.  They were founded in 1999 as "Jamat al-Tawd wa-al-Jihd" (yeah I had to look up the spelling on that).  1999 is during Clintons time, before W Bush was ever in the presidential office.  Then ISIS truly came about as we know them today in 2013 when they started claiming territory in Levant.  Since then ISIS has had about two years of only mildly opposed (by the US military) reign of multiple nations trying to form there own nation and establish a Caliphate.\n\nIf you notice the timeline here, the formation of the original core group happened before W Bush.  The formation ISIS as we know it today happened after W Bush.  \nIf we can singularly blame W Bush for that, we can blame him for literally anything.  All the stuff in Syria, Libya, etc can all be blamed on W Bush because he destabalized the region and brought more support to the terrorist groups around there.  \n\nI am not saying, nor have I ever in any of these statements said W Bush is without some blame in the matter.  He clearly was responsible for going into Iraq.  My very first post on the matter if you go back says as much.  Though I still maintain Obama had more of a direct influence on the formation of ISIS as we know it today than Bush ever did.  It happened under his presidency in 2013 to today, it occurred in large part because of his campaign promises/strategy of mass troop withdrawls from Iraq/the middle east creating a power vacuum especially in the wake of the death of Bin Laden which he also oversaw personally.  \nObama had the power and was in the position to do something about ISIS before it exploded into what it is today, he did not.  With that in mind if we have to blame a singular person/political figure I would say Obama hands down.  \n\nI am not sure how much more of a well reasoned argument I can present.  So I guess this is basically it.  My forehead has hit this wall enough for my tastes, good day.  '

Bush in 2008. It established that U.S. combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and all U.S. combat forces will be completely out of Iraq by December 31, 2011.[1] The pact required criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and required a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that were not related to combat.[1] U.S. contractors working for U.S. forces would have been subject to Iraqi criminal law, while contractors working for the State Department and other U.S. agencies would retain their immunity. If U.S. forces committed still undecided "major premeditated felonies" while off-duty and off-base, they would have been subjected to an undecided procedures laid out by a joint U.S.-Iraq committee if the U.S. certified the forces were off-duty.[2][3][1][4]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%E2%80%93Iraq_Status_of_Forces_Agreement\n\nObama didn\'t withdraw...Bush did.

If we stayed another 5 years and left, this would happen in five years.  Ten years, same.\n\nUnless we were truly committed to staying in Iraq forever, and having American soldiers die in Iraq forever and spend trillions more there forever, I don\'t really see staying as an option.\n\nThe simple reality is that there isn\'t any win in Iraq.

Obama was building enormous momentum by rallying and registering minority voters that typically vote in very small numbers. \n\nMcCain couldn't have played the same card, so he attempted to appeal to the female voters instead. \n\nOn top of that, he had a reputation of being old and crotchety and Obama was young and hip.  Palin score well in that regard because she was younger, attractive, and fiesty.\n\nIt was a last ditch effort.  And the risk wasn't huge because people didn't know much about her.  It forced the Democrats to scramble to dig up dirt on her... Which there wasn't really any yet because she was very inexperienced.  ... And Democrats couldn't attack her inexperience because Obama himself was extremely inexperienced. \n\nSo all in all, it wasn't a bad play.  Palin's image didn't take a huge hit mostly until after the election.  She muffled some interviews, but nothing major.  It wasn't until after the election when they took the muzzle off of her that she started to show her true colors. "

Warren didn't cause that."
p2112
aS"What I've been gathering from this, and it's maybe Obama's crux in pushing this deal (though I disagree with him if it is), is that this will allow AMERICAN corporations to bully other countries. As long as there's a president that will fight for the American people (Obama is maybe thinking Hilary) citizens here will be just fine.\n\nBut weakening other governments and populaces hurt us, too. If most of the world is experiencing our media through pirating, and this is a crack down on them, that crack down will come on us, as well. Not to mention that other countries finding more affordable ways to distribute medicine is a good thing no matter what pharmaceutical companies think. \n\nI honestly do believe Obama thinks this is a good deal for the American people much like Clinton must have thought that of NAFTA. But giving these corporations this leverage and making the American government the facilitator of their practices has proven to have a lot of unintended consequences on all populations as corporations just look at their bottom line.

This includes everything from the abusive use of plea bargaining, and the topic we\'re currently discussing about food. We can\'t keep kicking the can down the road and propping up the status quo because we don\'t want to touch difficult, nuanced and systemically disruptive legislation. We\'ve gotta take a hard look and a hard nosed approach to everything because we\'re past the point of repair and now we need to get down to the foundation and fundamental because many of our issues are there. \n\nPS: I want to thank you directly for talking with me here, though.

Obama has given a list of things he is going to ban from police....\nbut the list is of items that police never got. \nThey never get or have gotten tanks.\nThey never get or have gotten armed aircraft.\nThey never get or have gotten heavy machine guns.\nThey never get or have gotten "grenade launchers".\n\nWhat they have been given (and still will get due to the wording)..by definition... are\n1. APCs and MRAPs and Hummers (which are not tanks and thus not covered under this ban)\n2. Full auto personal weapons in .223 and .308 (which again are not heavy machine guns and also not .50 caliber and above, thus again, not covered under this ban)\n3. Body armor (which is not camo uniforms. those are supplied by depts. thus not covered under this ban)\n4. flare/tear gas launchers (by definition under ATF, 37mm are not classified as "grenade" launchers, thus not covered under this ban).\nSo this ban was worded very specifically to make it sound like Obama was against arming law enforcement with military gear but all it really says is that he isn\'t going to give them equipment that they already cannot receive and never have received.

aS'&gt; Alternatively, you can become better informed.\n\nThat\'s the point, I cannot.  This agreement is secret.  I only can go on what elected officials say.\n\n&gt; 12 million Americans are enjoying health insurance they didn\'t have before, thanks to the PPACA. \n\nThat\'s not mutually exclusive to what I said.  Yes more people are insured and that\'s good.  But Big pharma and insurance companies are getting a hell of a payout and already are trying to jack up the costs on the plans by 50% because there is nothing to stop them from doing so.  all of the protections that would have stopped this were forced out by the right to get it passed.  Obama was so obsessed with a win he let a bunch of real nasty shit through.\n\n&gt; Republican "it\'s a trick to enrich the insurance companies" rhetoric was effective on you, and on a large enough majority of Americans to cost Democrats the House and, eventually, the Senate. However, the legislation stands because the GOP didn\'t convince quite enough voters to abandon Congressmen who fought repeal. This may have something to do with the fact that the PPACA enabled 12 million Americans to gain health insurance and the plurality of these Americans now support both Congressmen that oppose repeal and the program.\n\nDude you are drinking the kool aid.  It wasn\'t just the right going with that argument, it was the left originally and the right took it to try and block it.  \n\nYes the bill is doing some good.  But it is so filled with crap and nonsense that 10 years from now this "crisis " comes back.\n\nThe answer, the only real answer, is a single payer system.\n\n&gt; So you voted for someone else. You weren\'t in the majority. Your voice wasn\'t strong enough to set national policy. That\'s politics in the modern world for you\n\nI did not actually.  I didn\'t vote.  No candidate running represented me or my interests.  \n\n&gt; If you wanted politics to be easy... I can\'t help you. If you want to know the path you need to take in order to have all of your views represented in Congress, this is it. Build coalitions of like-minded voters. Campaign for change as loudly and convincingly as possible. Win the trust of your neighbors.\n\nNo, that was how it used to work.  Now we have cults of personality and family money running things.  There\'s a reason we\'re talking Bush v Clinton again.\n\nRegardless that is completely off the point of what we were talking about.'

As Krugman has pointed out, President Obama has pursued the most intellectually dishonest positions on this issue and been exposed in the process.\n\nBill Clinton and Barack Obama are both intelligent enough that I wouldn't buy any suggestion that they didn't and don't see the counter-productive nature of both of their trade initiatives.

aS'&gt;They were running on an "Al Qaeda is on the run" line. The Benghazi attack proved that they weren\'t "on the run".\n\nObama said repeatedly that Al Qaeda *central*, in Afghanistan, had been badly injured, but that there were other huge threats, like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which was the group who made this attack.   \n\nI think that a lot of this, from the Republican side, was an attempt to push a "obama is weak on national defense" narrative in 2012.  It didn\'t at all stick; especially a year after the death of bin Laden, there was no way the public was going to buy that.  But that was why they tried to spin this into a huge issue.\n\n&gt;They did not think it was a spontaneous uprising. \n\nYou keep repeating that, but on the day it happened, intelligence services did think at the time there was a spontaneous aspect to it, encouraged by terrorist forces.  Again, we have quite a bit of written evidence that that is what the CIA thought at the time. Note that there was also a mass protest in Egypt the same day that ended up posing a threat to the US embassy in Egypt, and that one was entirely created by the video, so this wasn\'t a totally absurd think for the CIA to think, either (especially sine they apparently didn\'t have any assets on the ground in that area of Libya at the time).\n\n&gt;Of course it helps that most of the press is on their side\n\nI don\'t think that\'s even close to true; if anything, the mainstream press gave the various Benghazi conspiracy theories more attention then they really deserved, and they spent way more time on the Hilary e-mail story then that actually deserved, ect.   I mean, less then Fox News, if that\'s your frame of reference, but more then I think the actual evidence warrants.  \n\n&gt;As is par for the course for folks who post anti-Democrat opinions (no matter how reasonable) here, I\'ve got a waiting period.\n\nThat\'s a shame; I haven\'t downvoted you, and I don\'t think it\'s appropriate to downvote people you disagree with.

Their whole philosophy is stuck in the stone ages and based on \'just pray - god will save us. Oh, and give us money for more weapons, cause we really don\'t believe god will save us\'.\n\nThey used 9/11 to make wars, patriot act, tsa, and to consolidate more power - power which, suddenly, they think is wrong since Obama is president. Now, again - rather suddenly, they want lots of investigations into an attack. Something they didn\'t want much of when it came to 9/11 ("Don\'t criticize the president, we were attacked, real patriots would stand by him and wave flags!").'

aS"First of all, there's no way a GOPer will win in 2016. Not unless the Demo candidate is discovered with crack cocaine and hookers (male and/or female) 10 days before the election. Today's GOP is so fractured and dysfunctional that to win the primary, a Republican candidate has to tack so far to the right to not be labeled a RINO by the batshit-crazy fringe that it makes him/her completely unelectable in the general. This is a simple fact. Romney was the ideal candidate to take down a weak Obama in 2012, and couldn't live down the shit he had to say to win the nomination. It's a catch-22."

aS'That wasn\'t the question.  Which law school did you attend?  Don\'t be so shy.\n\nI\'m aware of the fact that trade agreements revolve around executive-congressional agreements, but it\'s not the black-and-white legal issue that you appear to assume here.  There are several constitutional issues surrounding Free Trade and Fast Track authority.  I shouldn\'t have to tell you that such a breach represents a major legal no-no.  In addition to what this article points out, Fast tracking any form of legislation purely for the unilateral benefit of a special interest group, like multinational corporations and the plutocrats who control the lion\'s share of them, could be construed as a violation of the 5th Amendment\'s Due Process Clause since it represents a legislative vetting and amendment process double standard...a major Constitutional no-no.  \n\nHere\'s some [background into the legal arguments surrounding executive-congressional agreements (see page 5)](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-896.pdf).  The initial legal challenge never made it to SCOTUS.  The third legal reason in this citation caught my eye as it validated these agreements on the basis that Free Trade was good for the country.  That legal reasoning is baseless since Free Trade has created nothing but economic problems for the U.S. from the onset, economically speaking.  This consequence effectively nullifies the court\'s concerns that invalidating trade agreements is "bad for the U.S.". \n\nAs someone who has worked with the people who are aggressively pushing Free Trade in the U.S. for decades, I\'m more than a little familiar with the overly aggressive legal stances they are not shy about employing when it comes to their pursuit of money.  In many cases, we\'re talking about blatant law-breaking, compromising the integrity of the legal code and Constitutional violations.  Obviously, many people have decided that it was worth violating the spirit of the Constitution in order to satisfy their greed.   The fact that Barack Obama was a Harvard law student who immersed himself in Constitutional law is not a confidence booster in his integrity on this issue.'

As he supports "targeted" drone strikes in countries we are not even close to being at war with. How would you feel if you were some kid in Yemen. You\'ve barely been outside your village. You\'ve heard of this place called America, but it is completely abstract to you. Then one day your village is hit by a predator drone, because there was some intelligence that there was a ranking member of al Qaida passing through. That\'s a moot point to you though, because the drone took out most of your family who happened to be in the area. Then when your surviving friends and family go to collect the corpses of your loved ones, a second strike comes along and kills them to. Now America is more than an abstract to him. Now it is the entity that killed his loved ones for no visible reason to you. What do you think that kid is going to do? Say oh!

aS"I stated this in another thread, and am reposting this here. Kind of my whole opinion on the whole deal: So /r/politics seems to hate this deal. My question would be, what would you do differently? The countries involved in this agreement are a part of the fastest growing area in the world and they are going to be the next hot markets. So what, just sit around and let other countries dictate the trade rules? Pretend that we can really stop globalization? Argue for a better deal, ok what do you think you can get out of them that Obama hasn't tried? In all honesty, this is starting to look like the Obamacare scare nonsense but for the left. You can't be against a deal, because there isn't a deal yet to be made. The reason for fast track authority is that you can't have 535 different people offering up amendments to an agreement that involves 11 different sovereign nations. For every amendment they would have to go back to the countries and say hey do you agree with this? On the secrecy, every single international agreement is done in secret from the Iran nuclear talks to trade agreements. You really can't have serious negotiations without them because people have to be frank, and they're not going to do that if they feel like they have to posture to the general public. Wait until the actual deal comes out, read it and if you think its generally bad then lobby your congressman to oppose it, and if you think its good, lobby to approve it. One thing Obama is right about though and that is the status quo is whats killing our labor market, and we can't compete for low wage manufacturing, unless you want making 56 cents an hour to be the new norm.\n"

aS"Actually, Obama was blocked by congress on that. They wouldn't fund shutting down the facility, but even if it was his fault that doesn't dispute my point.

aS'The only person who could have coming close to beating Hillary Clinton in the primary was Elizabeth Warren, and she\'s not running. Now Warren\'s fan club, who are finally starting to learn that "no means no" are splitting their vote between Hillary and Bernie, and that sounds about right. Now Hillary is starting to poll in the high 60\'s and low 70\'s. Barring a major fuck up of epic proportions, Hillary is untouchable.\n\nThere are those who will bring up how in 2008 Hillary was the presumed candidate and that she was beaten back then by Obama. Now, there\'s a ton of reasons why that comparison isn\'t appropriate not the least of which being that Hillary now has a 5 year stretch as Secretary of State under her belt. But the real reason is because at about this time Hillary was polling in the mid-30\'s and Obama was polling in the mid 20\'s with at least 2-3 other challengers of quality. Any unpartial observer would have concluded that Hilary was in a very strong position to win but was very much not untouchable.\n\nSomeone might think that all Hillary needs is strong competition. And while that might be true, it\'s important to remember that Hillary \'08 wasn\'t beaten by a man -- she was beaten by a movement. Bernie Sanders doesn\'t have a movement; he has a fan club. That makes him a lot more like Dennis Kucinich \'08 than Barack Obama \'08. And her other possible future competitors (who will likely be announcing in the next week or so) have all the charisma and draw of a cold bowl of soggy oatmeal. The wonky law and order technocrat types might like O\'Malley and the blue dogs might like Jim Webb and like the 4 people in Rhode Island who have heard of him will like Lincoln Chafee. But that\'s not a whole lot of Dems. More likely than not these guys are auditioning for Hillary\'s cabinet and won\'t be launching a serious offense.\n\nIs Hillary beatable by a Democrat in 2016? Maybe... but the stars would have to align exactly and they just aren\'t. There\'s no movement, no competition and no large public outcry for one. 70% is a big number. Chipping away at that takes time and money and while there\'s plenty of one there\'s no one with enough of the other.'

And Hillary right now is polling at about +10-11 against her potential Republican rivals, which is pretty good this early in the race. And they also polled Sanders versus the republican field, where he was tied or down a couple of points versus the Republicans and the Sandersites tried to spin this as Sanders being competitive. And that's frankly just a little delusional because if you're a Democrat tied in Washington, it's the equivalent of a Republican being tied with Hillary in South Carolina or Mississippi. If that's where the contest is being fought, you've already lost in a landslide."

At the same time, Al-Nusra and Daesh pulled back not wanting to be caught in the crossfire and fearing that they might also be targeted alongside the Syrian Army. That support never came, offensives ground to a halt, and things turned from bad to worse for the FSA when Daesh, instead of focusing on attacking regime forces, turned its attention on attacking the FSA, capturing their territory, and eventually selling oil to Assad to finance this war effort.*'

aS'The Democrats obviously did not win the popular vote in that many states or in House Districts. They only carried the big cities by huge margins. They lost in 80% of America.\n\nThere will be no rule on Gerrymandering from the Judicial Branch. Why? The whole point of the Electoral College is to ensure that the popular vote for the president does not elect our president. This is a founding principle in our Constitution. Our Constitution guarantees the states the right to Gerrymander themselves (as long as there is no racist intent). Gerrymandering has always been part of our system of government, as our president once said, "elections have consequences".\n\nIt is not practical for the GOP to Gerrymander, it really only worked for Democrats. Republicans can and do get minor advantages when they can, but it is the Democrats who benefit on a large scale from it. Gerrymandering is when you divide small parts of a big city into large rural districts so that the rural voters are disenfranchised. It doesn\'t really work in reverse. You cannot Gerrymander with rural districts to turn Philadelphia red because this only turns the rural districts blue. You can however take 25% of Philadelphia\'s Democrats into rural Districts and *still win* in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Democrats are only popular in a few highly populated area (cities). Romney won in 80% of our counties. Obama took 20%. You cannot *fairly* redistrict America to get a Democrat House, you have to get the majority of the vote in fairly drawn districts, and Democrats cannot do this. Obama and the Democrats have strong urban support but have no support elsewhere. For this reason they will never be able to control the government again until they broaden their geographic appeal.\n\nWhat is wrong with the concept that the cities *alone* should not rule America? \n\nWhat is wrong about our system that requires broader support?'

So the states were left to manage the issue themselves, and look how far we\'ve come! 38 out of 50 is great.

This could have transitioned into the issue of marriage equality if he wanted to. But he did not. \n\n2. That link does not provide much support to your statement.

[This webpage](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/same-sex-marriage-laws.aspx)  summarizes how each state went about legalizing gay marriage, and it appears that most state legislatures proposed it themselves, and were supported and signed in by their own state governors. \n \n\n3.

aS'First, the ability be honest in their conviction and not change stands on a given issue based on shifting public opinion. (Hillary has a great track record of changing her position based on public opinion. Voted for the Iraq war but than changed to being against it. Both she and Obama were against gay marriage but changed positions when it became popular to do so.)  This is not to say a President has to be completely unable to change but they need to be able to compromise for the greater good and not simply do it because it will gain them approval points. Second, be willing to take an unpopular position if it is the best one for the greater good. Third, be truthful with the American people and not sugar coat or spin things to make things seem better than they are. Trust in the people to follow you through tough times by being honest about the difficulties ahead. Be willing to acknowledge mistakes and not shift blame. In international policy  be forceful when necessary and demonstrate resolve. Seek out allies with common social and economic values. Don\'t draw "Red-lines" unless you are truly willing to take action. Understand that America is a super power and while we are not the wold police, we cannot be passive, we must support our friends to ensure our interests. Finally, have policies not just slogans. What exactly is Hillary\'s plan on any issue? (I\'m not picking on her but she is a great example of symbolism without substance.) What will they try to do if elected and are those goals both practical and for the good of the greatest number of Americans? '

On immigration Obama was to the right of Bush, not only ramping up arrests and deportations, he fought against the implementation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act in immigration detention centers, cynically thinking that if he allowed detainees to be raped they'd be less likely to contest their deportation.\n\nThis was all to lead up to him being accepted by the Republicans as tough on immigration... How did that go?\n\nOh I know, maybe Obama's lackluster stimulus package where he abdicated all responsibility? \n\nOh oh I know the shining pinnacle of his administration has been civil liberties, where he expanded warrantless wiretapping, and has fought against judicial or legislative review, allowing his appointees to intentionally perjure themselves in front of congress and refuse to investigate allegations by FISC. Or where he decided that torture is an executive branch prerogative which he claims he wont do directly (but continued to do by proxy) but that future presidents are free to do.\n\nPerhaps his stance on Plan B where he opposed young rape victims being able to access emergency contraception because he wanted to overrule the FDA since he didn't think it should be available to all. Instead in his opinion a thirteen year old who has been raped by her father should just be forced to have the child.\n\nHillary and her ilk have been weighed and found wanting.

But they won\'t expend their own treasure and lives if we do it for them. The vast majority of Americans believe as I do. Obama is trying to respect that as well as our commitments to our allies, so limited assistance is the right thing to do. Certainly ISIS is scary, just like the other terrorist organizations, and our home media (all types) let themselves be played by them because our media sees the revenue stream by portraying them as super scary, and ISIS (et al) know this.

aS'&gt;  Repubs approach of distorting, twisting, making shit up and then never, ever, ever backing down on the distorted factoids\n\nUse my example of the Obama statement: if preventable deaths were falling before the passage of the PPACA, isn\'t attributing the drop to the PPACA "distorting, twisting, [or] making shit up"? Did Obama back down? \n\n&gt;(as evidence, please reference 6 years of vitriol and hysteria on ACA)\n\nThe funny part is that Obama\'s statement above is almost identical to many Republican statements post-PPACA: that the PPACA caused premiums to rise when really they\'d been going up since before the PPACA was passed. Why should those Republicans\' statements be considered (mostly) false while Obama\'s is considered mostly true?\n\nIn any case:\n\n&gt;Its my impression that politifact comes off as giving Dems leeway because Dems tend approach the edge of what a fact could be interpreted for rather than the Repubs approach\n\nYou basically said that Rs/Ds both mislead people, but Politifact gives one group leeway because that group tends to bend the truth in a certain way (vice the other). Is that not effectively the same thing as a double standard? Is that not a good reason to take the ratings with a grain of salt?'

Basically, poor people are stupid, single minded folks who get their opinions feed to them by others.

Much like non-poor rural and urban folks.\n\nRural people tend to be independent. As such, they don\'t trust the government. When President Obama went to Montana, to a small rural ranching community, to sell the Affordable Care Act, he completely misjudged the people. The federal government coming in and saying, "Don\'t worry, we\'ll take care of you" doesn\'t go over well. These are people who, from their view, get screwed over by the EPA, the BLM, the USFS, and other federal agencies there to take care. Many people in rural America work jobs for barely more than what they could collect in welfare and food stamps. That\'s who they are. They don\'t trust Obama to care for them any more than they trusted Bush. They would rather scrape by than to be dependent on the government. In many cases, it is in their genes.\n\nOf course, the issue is more complex than I am describing, but anybody who tells you poor rural folks are Republican because they don\'t know any better shows that they truly don\'t understand their political foes.'

aS'&gt; Rural people tend to be independent. \n\nCitation needed. \n\n&gt;As such, they don\'t trust the government. \n\nSo you\'re spinning the narrative that because they\'re rugged individual types they don\'t like the government? Maybe it\'s because of a 40 year long conservative trend to paint the government an entity that steals from people who look like them and gives it to those brown people who are invading our country. \n\nI think this is the far more likely scenario than your "they\'re more rugged and independent" explanation .\n\n&gt; When President Obama went to Montana, to a small rural ranching community, to sell the Affordable Care Act, he completely misjudged the people. \n\nWhat evidence do you have of him misjudging the people? Or really making any judgment. Again, the far more likely scenario is that being a political veteran he\'s not completely unaware that rural people are more conservative and more "states right" federal government = bad types. It really seems like you\'re just spewing biased rhetoric disguised as commentary. \n\n&gt;  The federal government coming in and saying, "Don\'t worry, we\'ll take care of you" doesn\'t go over well. \n\nThey Fox News framing you just gave the Affordable Care Act really shows your bias. I don\'t think that\'s an objective non partisan way to frame the creation of an insurance exchange. But that definitely is the Fox News way to frame it. I assume your out is "that\'s not the wya I view it, I\'m just saying that\'s probably the way they view it since they\'re so rugged and individual." But if that\'s the case, then the question is why are their perceptions so out of wack with reality. I bet conservative propaganda plays a part but that doesn\'t seem to fall in line with your "their independent individualist" narrative.\n\n&gt; These are people who, from their view, get screwed over by the EPA, the BLM, the USFS, and other federal agencies there to take care. \n\nGetting screwed over by the EPA? BLM? Please tell me how the EPA BLM screws rural people. I am really honestly curious. Or how they can view the EPA and their day to day life connected enough to think about it as a source for their daily life. Because otherwise this just sounds like Fox News simple narrative of "farmers hurt by EPA" as opposed to reality. \n\n&gt; Many people in rural America work jobs for barely more than what they could collect in welfare and food stamps. That\'s who they are. \n\nCitation needed. Your bias is becoming obvious now. Your spewing this "rural rugged individualism" "hard worker" "don\'t collect food stamp" narrative that is right out of Fox News. \n\n&gt; They don\'t trust Obama to care for them any more than they trusted Bush. \n\nYes. They liked Bush, mostly because he was a republican, and hate Obama. Why are you pretending that their hate for liberal policies is rational (they\'re more rugged and takes less food stamps) and non-partisan (they\'re independent, they hate bush and Obama the same)?  \n\n&gt;They would rather scrape by than to be dependent on the government. In many cases, it is in their genes.\n\nAnd the last topping of "they\'re not government moochers." So to recap on your narrative of why rural people hate liberal policies it\'s because: They\'re independent strong white men that don\'t need no government, they work too much to earn food stamps, they hate Bush and Obama equally (did I mention they\'re independent).   \n\ntl:dr - How does such a glaringly poor comment make it so high in /r/politics.

aS'Fuck paywalls.\n\nThough imperialism is now held in disrepute, empire has been the default means of governance for most of recorded history, and the collapse of empires has always been messy business, whether in China and India from antiquity through the early 20th century or in Europe following World War I.\n\nThe meltdown we see in the Arab world today, with chaos in parts of North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Levant, is really about the final end of imperialism. The Islamic States capture of Palmyra, an ancient caravan city and one of the most visually stunning archaeological sites in the Near East, only punctuates this point. Palmyra represents how the region historically has been determined by trade routes rather than fixed borders. Its seizure by the barbarians only manifests how the world is returning to that fluid reality.\n\nIt is actually three imperial systems whose collapse we are now witnessing in the Middle East.\n\nFirst, Middle Eastern chaos demonstrates that the region has still not found a solution to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. For hundreds of years, Sunnis and Shiites, Arabs and Jews, Muslims and Christians, in Greater Syria and Mesopotamia had few territorial disputes. All fell under the rule of an imperial sovereign in Istanbul, who protected them from each other. That system collapsed in 1918, unleashing the demon of national, ethnic, and sectarian disputes over who controls which territory at what border precisely.\n\nSecond, the implosion of Iraq in the wake of the toppling of Saddam Hussein, the implosion of Syria in the wake of the Arab Spring, and the rise of the Islamic State has brought to an end the borders erected by European imperialism, British and French, in the Levant.\n\nThird, the demonstrably hands-off approach to these developments by President Barack Obama manifests the end of Americas great power role in organizing and stabilizing the region. And the United States, remember, since the end of World War II, has been a world empire in all but name. (Nobody, perhaps, makes this uncomfortable point more comprehensively than Oxford historian John Darwin in his 2007 book After Tamerlane: The Rise and Fall of Global Empires, 1400-2000.)\n\nAnd it is not just imperial forces that have declined and left chaos in their wake. The fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, Muammar al-Qaddafi in Libya, and the reduction of Bashar al-Assads regime in Syria to that of an embattled statelet has ended the era of post-colonial strongmen, whose rule was organically connected to the legacy of imperialism. After all, those dictators ruled according to the borders erected by the Europeans. And because those imperial borders did not often configure with ethnic or sectarian ones, those dictatorial regimes required secular identities in order to span communal divides. All this has been brutally swept away.\n\nAlas, the so-called Arab Spring has not been about the birth of freedom but about the collapse of central authority, which says nothing about the readiness of these states, artificial and otherwise, for the rigors of democracy.\n\nAmong the states affected by the current upset, two kinds have been discernible. First, there are the age-old clusters of civilization. These are places that have been states in one form or another going back as far as antiquity, and thus have evolved sturdy forms of secular identity that have risen above ethnicity and religious sect. Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt are the most striking in this category. If one looks at a map of Roman sites along the North African coast, one will see that the map is crowded with settlements where these countries are located, and relatively absent of settlements in the vast stretches in-between of Algeria and Libya. In other words, Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt are historically definable. Whatever tumult and regime changes they have experienced in the course of the Arab Spring, their identities as states have never been in question. And so the issues in these countries have been about who rules and what kind of government there should be, not about whether or not a state or central government is even possible.\n\nThe second group of Middle Eastern states is even more unstable. These take the form of vague geographical expressions and they are places with much weaker identities  and, in fact, many have identities that were invented by European imperialists. Libya, Syria, and Iraq fall most prominently into this category. Because identity in these cases was fragile, the most suffocating forms of authoritarianism were required to merely hold these states together. This is the root cause for the extreme nature of the Qaddafi, Assad, and Hussein regimes, which practiced levels of repressions far more severe than those of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia. Algeria, also an artificial state, essentially invented by the French, has experienced remote and sterile authoritarian rule, and now faces an uncertain transition given the declining health of its ruler, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has been in power since 1999. Jordan, too, is a vague geographical expression, but has enjoyed moderate governance through the genius of its ruling Hashemites and the overwhelming economic and security support this small country has received from the United States and Israel. Yemen may also be an age-old cluster of civilization, but one always divided among many different kingdoms due to its rugged topography, thus ruling the territory as one unit has always been nearly impossible.\n\nOnly suffocating totalitarian regimes could control these artificial countries formed from vague geographical expressions. When these regimes collapsed they left behind an utter void. For between the regime at the top and the tribe and extended family at the bottom, all intermediary forms of social and political organization were eviscerated long before by such regimes. Totalitarianism was the only answer to the end of Western imperialism in these artificial states, and totalitarianisms collapse is now the root cause of Middle East chaos.\n\nOverlaying this meltdown of vague geographical expressions and the less severe weakening of age-old clusters of civilization has been the rise of indigenous regional powers such as Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. Iran is a great, old-world civilization on one hand and a ruthless and radicalized sub-state on the other. This is what accounts for its dynamic effectiveness around the region. A Persian empire has been based in one form or another on the Iranian Plateau since antiquity. Thus, rather than face political identity problems like the Arabs, Iranians are blessed with a cultural self-certainty comparable to that of the Indians and Chinese.\n\nAt the same time, however, the narrow assemblage of radical mullahs running the government of Tehran represent a sub-state akin to jihadi groups like the Islamic State, Hezbollah, al Qaeda, and the former Mahdi Army. Thus Iran is able to operate with unconventional flair. Iran has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, trained radical and militarized proxy forces in the Levant, and brilliantly conducted negotiations with its principal adversary, the United States. Thus does Iran partially inherit the void left by the disappearance of Ottoman, European, and American empires.\n\nWhereas Iran is the Shiite node of power in the newly sectarian Middle East, Saudi Arabia is the Sunni node. Saudi Arabia, compared to Iran, is the artificial creation of a single extended family. The country the Saudi family governs does not territorially configure with the Arabian Peninsula to the extent that Iran configures with the Iranian Plateau. Nevertheless, the House of Saud has impressively navigated its way over the decades through immense social transformation at home and a tumultuous security situation abroad. And the recent high-level personnel changes engineered by the new king, Salman, including the replacement of the crown prince and foreign minister, indicates the absolute determination of this dynasty to readjust its policies in order not to let Iran dominate the region.\n\nSaudi Arabias recent bombing campaign against Iran-backed Houthi tribesmen in Yemen and Riyadhs renewed intensification of support for anti-Iranian Syrian rebels (helped also by Turkey and Qatar) is a reaction to what Riyadh sees as an impending American-Iranian nuclear accord. Indeed, the Saudis are already factoring into their calculations the strong possibility of such a deal, and thus the bombing in Yemen and recent pressure on the pro-Iranian Assad regime in Syria represent  ahead of the actual fact  the post-nuclear accord Middle East. That accord, if it indeed happens, though limited to nuclear issues, will be viewed with some justification as the beginning of a more general American-Iranian rapprochement-of-sorts: in regional terms, that is, one declining imperial power coming to terms with a rising indigenous power.\n\nTo contain a post-accord Iran, the United States will need not only to bolster Saudi Arabia, but Egypt and Turkey as well. Egypts security services under de facto military strongman Abdel Fattah el-Sisi are already quietly allied with the Israeli security services in Gaza, Sinai, and elsewhere. America requires a strong Egypt  democratic or not  as a regional anti-Iran ally to bolster Saudi Arabia. While Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not normally viewed as a pro-American country, a strong Turkey in and of itself also helps balance against Iranian power. The jostling among these geographically and historically fortunate powers for regional dominance will define the new post-imperial order.'

aS'Bernie is a good guy. Obama likes to look like a good one. While he "reels in" the NSA, he has his executive agencies put pressure on state and local authorities to drop cases rather than compromise (in their minds) Stingray. He says one thing and does another, with just enough of the right words to give his supporters a bone to beat those critical of him. You may not be this sort of person, but just criticizing Obama gets more grief than not. Hillary will also be "do what I say" after the election. Bernie? There\'s the guy I\'m picking because he doesn\'t owe his soul to any party. '

aS"&gt; Assuming you are in favor of more liberal policies, what is it about Clinton, and her past actions, that you base your support for her on?\n\nI see centrists like Obama and Clinton as a path to getting more of what I want. Clinton in particular has a major adviser that will be in her ear every day -- President Bill Clinton. In fact, I predict it may become an issue during her presidency -- as the right wing takes issue with his level of involvement with her presidency. \n\nWhat we've seen with Bill and Obama is, there are things for liberals to criticize, certainly, but you're getting a lot of support for policy that is right on target with the base. Hillary, in the 90s, championed Healthcare reform that excluded the insurance companies. The HMOs spent a lot of money killing it. Between this, and Joe Lieberman, the HMOs were included this time around. Even so, the ACA has a lot of things going for it that liberals can be happy about. And it may even have a back door that leads us back to eventually excluding the insurance companies again -- the healthcare exchanges. \n\nOn Foreign Policy, I think that while many people believe Hillary is a hawk, I expect her presidency to be similar to Bill's and have a body count (one metric for FP) lower than Obama's and much, much lower than Bush's (100,000+ Iraqis dead is hard to match, not that we should want to).  \n\nThe Supreme Court is another front where Bill and Obama have both done a good job of seating liberal, even anti-corporate (to an extent) justices. I see Hillary continuing this trend (obviously the first priority is someone who will be pro-choice, but I would be surprised if we don't get more nominees like Sotomayor). \n\n&gt; Do you not worry about her campaign donations and speaking fees from large Wall Street institutions?\n\nI want to see Democrats run in the same elections as everyone else. That said, they've been good on campaign finance issues. Their justices in the SCOTUS dissented in *Citizens* (a case which was actually about Hillary so you know she has no love for it) and *McCutcheon*. Every Democrat Senator caucused for the **DISCLOSE Act** in 2010, but since every Republican Senator caucused against it, it never passed. \n\nI'd rather vote for someone who takes money and then governs well -- maybe even reforming the system to stop soft money, than someone who doesn't take money and never gets elected. \n\n&gt; I, too, would vote for Hillary over any republican, for the record.\n\nAnd similarly, I would campaign for Bernie and vote for him if he is the nominee. I welcome moving to the left. But the truth might be that the left needs to stand together and be very, very patient for that to happen. "

aS"If I'm playing devil's advocate for a second here, I think Marco Rubio is probably the best choice for the Republicans to put up against Hillary Clinton. He's a true believer who says the right things the right way. He's a youthful Cuban from Florida who weaves personal experiences in his rhetoric. It's a helluva contest with Hillary's elder statesman matter-of-fact wonkiness that can come off a bit brusque and condescending. And, again, Florida. All roads to the White House go through Florida for the Republicans and Obama won it by less than 1% in 2012. Even just a 2-point native son/Latino brethren bump could put Florida out of reach for the Democrats.\n\nBut the Democrats don't really need Florida. It's the frontline in a 4-state firewall. After Florida you need Virginia and then Ohio and either New Hampshire or Colorado, and I just don't see Rubio picking that up. Really, short of an unforced error on the part of Team Hillary I don't see the Republicans making more than token gains outside of the sunshine state."

No thanks. \n\n&gt; Hilary who had had the privilege of knowing the goings on in the Whitehouse under her husband knows what she stands for based on the money that she had already lined her pockets with.\n\nI have no idea what you\'re implying, but the first Clinton presidency was pretty good for the lower and middle class. \n\n&gt; She will be checked on her bs meter after this primary.\n\nSomeone should check yours. \n'

p2285
aS"My own radical theory is that the rural/urban conservative/liberal split is entirely a function of migration from rural areas to big cities. \n\nThe great plains have the most outmigration and are the most conservative, appalachia and the deep south have less and mix some more democratic votes than are typical.\n\nThis is because anyone who does not have a stable job or family in a rural area that is bleeding has zero reason to remain there. The only people who move there do so for typically well paying jobs. \n\nPeople who have very stable jobs and family and also have a closed social network are likely to be more conservative. Again, this describes the kind of people who actually have reason to be in the empty part of North Dakota.\n\n&gt;When President Obama went to Montana, to a small rural ranching community, to sell the Affordable Care Act, he completely misjudged the people. \n\nI don't think Montana ranching country really typifies conservative rural and small town locales with a largely low income white population.\n\nMeaningful numbers of non-urban Republican voters probably live in places like Georgia or Ohio where the rural population density is higher. These people are not independent ranchers navigating a bureaucracy that is mostly present western states where a significant percentage of land is federally owned.\n\n"

aS'The GOP has no chance at the Presidency, they are too polarized.

Within that time, dozens of impact studies must be conducted, completed, and sent to Congress along with the bill...\n\nOnce Congress gets it, they have 90 days to get to a vote. There are also certain procedures it must pass in Congress (all in the fast track bill) so there's basically no way there will be a vote until they get near the end of the 90 days\n\n\n\n*it could be 60 days, I'm on my phone and my memory is fuzzy.

Ben Carson and Marco Rubio come the closest, each trailing by 10 at 49/39. Jeb Bush and Scott Walker are each down by 11 at 48/37 and 49/38 respectively. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul face 12 point deficits at 50/38.  Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry lag by 13 points at 50/37.

aS"&gt; If you lived under good economic times under Clinton and Obama, and the worst economy in modern history under Bush, your 'economic' argument is not only invalid, but disingenuous.\n\nThe reality is that for most people the Bush years and the Obama years were about the same. I kept my job through them both, I haven't experienced not having enough money for food or shelter. But I just heard a conservative radio host (because I listen to conservative radio for self-punishment) tell me how bad Obama has been for the economy, for jobs, for foreign policy etc... without actually citing any real hard facts YESTERDAY. Just as an off-hand comment. Like this is a known thing that they don't even need to explain.

aS'The psychological reasons so many people doubled down on stupid after the failures of deregulation and the Bush wars are simple: *they\'re vote made it possible and they want to avoid responsibility.*\n\nImagine this:  your attitude is everything is Liberalism\'s fault and now with George Bush you\'re getting a chance to put into play right-wing policies.  It\'s 2004, the economy is booming and the war seems to have been the cakewalk as claimed.  You vote for Bush again... 5 years later the wars are a fiasco, and both housing prices &amp; and the *global* economy are in free fall.  \n\n\nIn such a scenario you have three choices: shut the f*** up and get out of the way, apologize and help fix your mess, or double down on stupid. \n\nThink about it: when Barack Obama was elected everything the Republicans claimed as a victory was shown to have been a failure.  This is why the leadership met the night of Obama\'s inauguration and treasonously plotted to stop anything from being achieved.  They ramped up the rhetoric and used the Tea Party to keep supporters mesmerized.    Since those supporters had gone from the high of "mission accomplished" to their hero needing Big Government to bail out Wall Street, followed by a black Democrat whose middle name is Hussein...well, it broke already unhinged minds right off.'

Everyone on Limbaugh\'s show was talking about how Michelle was trying to divide the country into "us vs. them" with that speech.\n\nSome woman called into the show to agree. She stated that even though she\'s white, she wasn\'t born into privilege and that there\'s no use in pointing fingers or making it us vs. them, and as the first lady she should be trying to *unify* the country. \n\n*Immediately* after saying that, she said the only reason the Obama\'s are going with this "narrative" is so they can distract us from the real issue--that Islam is running rampant through our country and we need to solve that problem.\n\nNow I know what people mean when they say they literally can\'t even...I still cannot even....'

All things that Paul is with liberals on and Obama is with conservatives on.\n\nMy only concern would be his decisions regarding EPA enforcement, but I think the above items are much more important in the near term, so I would like to see someone in office to reign these things in.\n\nAs far as I've seen only Paul and Sanders would do anything to change the status quo on those.\n\nIf you can tell me any way that his opinions on social issues would affect his presidential policy making I'll reconsider my position."

The Clintons were far more seasoned to that kind of thing, and Hillary already went through the ins and outs of her healthcare reform push in the 90s. She might have been able to get something more progressive than Obamacare through in 2008-2010.\n\nObama wasted a lot of effort in 2008-2010 naively trying to win over bipartisanship when it was utterly hopeless all along.

Further eroding the 4th Amendment.\n\nWe've seen Obama continue our combat focus in Afghanistan, and very strong, barely resisted, attempts to get us more involved in Syria.  As well as very badly handled arming of rebels and exiting of Iraq which has led us to ISIS controling much of Syria and Iraq.\n\nWe've seen an administration filled with lobbyists and former industry insiders from places like Monsanto and Comcast forming policy for their very own industries, despite his promises to do the opposite.\n\nWe've seen more whistleblowers attacked by a President than any president in history, from an administration that promised to be the most transparent in history.\n\nSpeaking of transparency this President has also pressured congress to once again forgo their constitutional rights and allow him to push through the biggest trade deal in history, in complete secrecy.  A treaty which has been shown through leaks to hurt American and Asian workers, will attack net neutrality, free speech and give corporations more power over the people and governments of the involved nations.\n\nHillary Clinton will bring us more of the same, except she will probably be more aggressive militarily and be much more lax on the financial sector.  This is the woman who just earned $600,000 over a week speaking to Goldman Sachs.\n\nShe is not on your side.  You would be dumb to think she is and is liberal and shares your values."

She thinks she is pre-ordained but this country is ready for someone who will fight for Americans and not just the 1% who have already ripped this nation off and part....she has a shrill voice, and the words that come out are uninspired and contrived. She lacks a real authenticity that only Bernie has.\n\nThe problem is, Bernie cannot make any changes unless we give him a congress he can work with....and 40% the country, gerrymandered, con-trolls the house.\n'

aS"That is my point. The Democrats have failed to get people to vote with their beliefs, both political and social, which, if every eligible voters cast a ballot, would put a democrat in a vast majority of the elected offices in this country at every level. The Republicans, meanwhile, get everyone to vote against their beliefs and in many cases their best interests. This is as much a failure for the Democrats as it is a victory for the Republicans.\n\nPeople basically treated Obama as the Messiah because they so strongly needed an anti-Bush to undo the horrors of the first 8 years of the 21st century. Clearly, Obama has not lived up to the billing. He's just some guy, and not a great man. Still, the democrats are going to have the inside track on the White House again, because the American people have a long memory, but only for the office of the President. With everything else, it's apparently amnesia."

aS'&gt;Being protected does not mean being supported to them. (to me it does...)\n\nBut that\'s EXACTLY what they are demanding of women (including rape victims).  \n\nThey are forcing a woman to physically support another human being and then turning around and saying, "sure we made a decision, but we don\'t have the responsibility to support you or the baby".\n\n&gt;Sure, ok, no one has an obligation to risk their own life for someone else. There are those who are anti-abortion who consider this legit, and are only for anti-abortion for abortions where the mothers life is not at risk. So when it comes to other abortions, where the issues are not life threatening, how does one decide what life gets trumped? What metric should one use?\n\nAll unattended labor is a risk that shouldn\'t be forced on women.  \n\nYou can\'t wait until she\'s in the middle of dying and then ask if she has enough money to get an emergency abortion.\n\nIf the state won\'t pay, they get no say.\n\n&gt;Factual information? Sorry, the root cause of the increase in infant mortality in the US has not been discovered.\n\nGive me any other theory.  Anything.  It always comes back to right-wing policy either in terms if shutting down women\'s health clinics (Rick Perry blocked federal funding to clinics that didn\'t even provide abortions to make himself look tough) or because of cuts to healthcare.\n\nNot only that but in 2011, the republican controlled house PASSED a bill (hr358) whose only purpose was to remove the protection of medical law and triage from pregnant women alone.\n\nThis means that women suffering from ectopic pregnancies or complicated miscarriages (in both situations the embryo is dead or dying) could be legally abandoned to die by doctors or hospitals.  \n\nHR358 stalled because Obama promised to veto it. \n\n\n\n'

aS'Jryan27 made a snarky comment about Obama not being a liberal (in his mind at least). My comment was that many people consider him to be left of their own personal stance.\n\nFacts? I suppose it depends on who rates the term, but here is a reasonable article by Nate Silver that puts Obama halfway between moderate and left wing fringe.\n\nhttp://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/how-liberal-is-president-obama/?_r=0\n\nAnd surveys have always shown that more people self describe themselves as conservative than liberal.\n\nhttp://m.mic.com/articles/78691/do-more-americans-identify-as-liberal-or-conservative-check-this-chart\n\nI know it has been trending left and if you break down social vs fiscal you can get different numbers,  and it doesn\'t ask those same people to define Obama, but still, it indicates that conservatives are not a rare breed.\n\nBut I still stand behind my original comment that many people feel Obama sits to the left of them on the political spectrum. A statement so radical that the hive mind here voted me down hard.\n\nI don\'t believe you can accurately define and rate subjectively  who is a "true liberal". It is pointless to compare American liberals to EU liberals. Within the context of the American voters, if you use Obama\'s positions as a knife edge and force everybody to answer whether they are either left or right of him, you are going to get a pretty even split. So like I said, many of us consider him too liberal.'

aS'This time in that election cycle Obama was 11 points behind and a clear contender.  Alternatively, Sanders current [RCP](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html) is 7.4 and Clinton leads her nearest contender by 51%...and that is Elizabeth Warren.  One could not at all have compared Obama in 08 before the primaries to either Sander this cycle or Paul in 2012.  Paul, by the by, was running right around 8% at this point and was within a tenth of a point of second place in the polls and looked far more like a contender than Sanders does at the moment and was still considered a dark horse since he was a whole 9 points behind Romney.'
p2330
aS"The congress is more important in those regards, because everything Sean is concerned about would require new legislation or repeal of old legislation.  If the congress is Democratic a veto isn't going to matter.  The point is that the President doesn't lead on these matters, and without congress is powerless to push through much of an agenda, as we've seen with Obama.\n\nTo me we should be concerned chiefly about the president's executive powers more than his veto pen.  Especially with all of the above concerns I have about what Obama has carried on from Bush's presidency.  Which are conveniently ignored by people like Sean.\n\nThese are things that I and other liberals voted for Obama to rescind, not to embrace.  For some reason people like Sean only cared when Bush was doing them, and that's why I don't want another Democrat in power.  The anti-war/anti-military/anti-NSA left is asleep while the Whitehouse is blue."

aS"Way off base, Obama was polling higher by now with large name recognition and parties ties. People don't seem to get Obama basically started a set up to run in 2004 with his keynote and the dnc supported it as a strong future. He had major players on his side early and won endorsements from hugely popular and important democrats which shocked Hillary's camp and turned many voters, sanders hasn't been a democrat before he just had caucused with them in the senate he has very little set up networking to win those defining endorsements, he will probably get some big labor ones but for politicians, party bundlers or party leaders he's way off from what Obama was. Not only that Obama's community organizing background (particularly in Iowa and the other caucus states), and freaking Oprah one of the most popular women in America at the time campaigning for him in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina are all defining moments on why he won. Sanders is so far behind and so different in terms of ground to make up and clear path, the comparison doesn't fit. "
p2332
aS"Obama has continued most of the horrible policies of W. Bush from illegal NSA spying and drone warfare to whistleblower crackdowns and secret trade deals.  \n\nEverything he's done are things that liberals used to hate until a Democrat started doing them.

He has limited powers for those paying attention.'

aS"I just wish congress would start taxing these immigrants. I understand why people wouldn't want non-tax paying people to live in this country with their families, but the only reason Obama used his executive order was to force Congress's hand into finding a solution.

aS"They have apparently enacted [18 bills so far this year](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?status=28,29,32,33&amp;sort=-current_status_date), none of them of any major import IMO. Most just renew funding appropriations for various departments (because why would they shut down the government when they more or less run it?), making some small changes with minimal impact, and most recently, the bipartisan bill that Congress would have to approve any peace treaty the President made with Iran (this after Republicans infamously derailed the process by undermining the president and removing his leverage by declaring that no treaty he signed would carry weight).\n\nRepublicans in Congress also approved the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and a resolution and disapproving of National Labor Relations Board procedures that would make it easier for employees to vote to form a union, but Obama vetoed both of these.\n\nThat's all they've accomplished so far this year.\n\nBy comparison, in the two years previous, Congress enacted 296 bills."
p2344
aS"Coming shit storm? Here's what will happen: the SCOTUS will wreck the law.  The GOP will come swooping in with a bill that will fix the language, but also have a provision that says the mandates must go.  Obama is now fucked.  GOP wins. Democrats hide in their holes while conservatives take victory laps.\n\nWhat this woman says is irrelevant."
p2345
aS"Obama's not going to sign anything that repeals or sets the stage to repeal his signature law. Other things he might cave on given enough pressure, but not this.\n\nPlus, a bad court ruling WON'T effect a number of states that did set up their own state exchanges. Why would Obama sabotage those states by agreeing to repeal the mandate? If the court ruling crippled Obamacare in all 50 states it might be different, but it's not.\n\nThe most likely outcome in the chaos is either the GOP is forced to cave and pass a clean fix. Or if congress does nothing, the states are forced to immediately set up their own state health insurance exchanges, at their own expense (it's written into Obamacare how long the states have to setup the exchanges on Federal government expense)."
p2346
aS"Well, Clinton's poll numbers were most likely higher than that before Obama threw his hat in the race for primaries in 07 (for the election of 08)\n\nEven still when Obama announced that he was running for president she still had a relatively good lead over Obama.\n\n&gt;Overall, 45 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents support Clinton to be the party's nominee, with Obama second at 30 percent. Edwards, whose hopes for winning depend heavily on a victory in the Iowa caucuses in January, is at 12 percent. Clinton's margin over Obama has been generally steady since February, just after the two candidates launched their presidential bids.\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/22/AR2007072201135.html"

aS"&gt; Barack Obama has the balls to issue that well-deserved honor for Edward Snowden\n\nNever in a million years. Obama is no unwilling participant in the creation of the surveillance state, he's right up front hammering this thing into form.  With his war on whistleblowers, his US citizen drone assassinations, his fight for indefinite detention of US citizens by the military under the [National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedges_v._Obama) (NDAA), and his use of the Espionage Act against activists more than any other US president, it shows he's pretty happy with the monster he's created, and he's not about to let Snowden ruin his party.  "
p2348
aS"If Obamacare is struck down, no politician will touch healthcare policy with a 10 foot pole for another fifty years.\n\nIt absolutely destroyed Obama's presidency.  He came in with a huge mandate and large majorities in both chambers of Congress, and spent every ounce of political capital he had to get us to where we are now.  Nearly a third of Democratic Congressmen lost their jobs for this, and Obama became a lame duck after just half a term in office.\n\nYou really think the Democrats are going to want to go for Round 2 if Obamacare fails?  You think that they'd try an *even more liberal* bill?  Hell fucking no.\n\nIf Obamacare goes down, the Republicans will pass their dream bill: eliminating malpractice suits, privatizing Medicare, and allowing insurance to be sold across state lines (sparking a race to the bottom where all the insurance companies move to the state with the most lax regulation).  Life will get worse for everyone, and Republicans will just say that any suffering is the aftershocks of that horrible Obamacare disaster.  Eventually that excuse will wear out, but even then we'll need a new liberal supermajority before we can even consider trying again.  You'll be an old man by the time we get another shot."

p2350
aS'True, but it also says in the article that "4 out of 10 Democrats who said that in assessing presidential candidates, strength and experience are more important than new ideas or a new direction."  which was the basis for Obama\'s candidacy.\n\nEDIT:  Don\'t get me wrong, Bernie Sanders doesn\'t most likely have a chance against Hillary, but they also said that about Obama vs Hillary.  Long before Obama was in the race the pundits were already calling the primary for Clinton.  "I don\'t see anyone that will compete with Hillary."  Chris Matthews said it religiously.'

aS'I\'m sorry, but then your friend is a douche himself. Appearance and charisma are things that are important to people, I get that, but isn\'t it more important to actually vote for someone who at least feigns to represent your values and what is important to you?  \n  \nFor example, we have Angela Merkel...that woman is a social mess. She is awkward, very manly, keeps her private life pretty much to herself, her voice is infuriating (as much as her dialect) and she has this monotone that can really make you think she doesn\'t care at all. Yet, somehow, people have voted for her 3 terms in a row now and I\'m sad to say, she is probably not doing such a shitty job at politics, although her actions are often being seen as "wrong" or "too harsh", but these are difficult times. I\'m not necessarily a supporter of hers, nor do I think she has any charisma and she looks like horse manure, BUT she\'s apparently good at politics, despite all of that (and I don\'t think there is anyone out there who finds Merkel pretty or charismatic).  \n  \nAnyway, what you guys need is at least 1 more strong party...that 2 party system is fucked up beyond belief, so is the voting system in general in my opinion, but that\'s a topic for another day. I would really like to see Sanders as the next President of the USA, because he is apparently something so radically different that it might just be that what the world needs. Just like when Obama ran for Pres...too bad he couldn\'t keep all of his promises, but overall he is probably doing not such a bad job. Not minding the whole spy scandals and stuff...I\'m really not sure how much say the President really has in these matters anyway.'

Should this bill pass then it's the status quo, except the government has to ask Verizon for the data before they can look at it right away. Companies tend to not put up much of a fuss when the government comes looking."

You don\'t want both sides represented in media, you want a cudgel to beat those that dare have different ideas and opinions than you. You just want to limit the speech of those you think might harm whatever agenda you\'re currently pushing. This is a common tactic of authoritarian regimes. It happens because they know their ideas are so weak that making them open to criticism may show everyone how weak they are. \n\n&gt;Here\'s the standard Merriam-Webster definition of "propaganda".\n\nOk. So when President Obama lied to everyone by saying "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor" he should be charged with sedition, right? How about when candidate Obama promised to close Gitmo? Sedition? Those were lies told to help a political agenda or government. So to you he should be thrown in jail, right? How about when Harry Reid lied and said Romney hadn\'t paid taxes in 10 years, sedition? Harry Reid in jail, yes?'

People can see how it can effect them, it's new and interesting idea, it sparks debate, and motivates people to contact their representatives to tell them how they feel about it.\n\nRepealing Obamacare 40 times isn't really generating any interest in politics or generating any debate. After the first 20+ times people stop paying attention, so no new interest. Repubs weren't introducing any new ideas of their own, just rejecting Obama's ideas, so no new ideas to talk about. And the debate was old, the healthcare debate already took place for a long time and Obama won, so no new debate for people to be excited about or get involved in.\n\n**tl;dr:** This generates interest, debate, and political involvement. Repealing Obamacare multiple times doesn't. "

If the US would have guided the Iraq government elections and military operations, which was part of the long term plan, today it would likely be a stable country.  But, Obama had promises to keep to his dove buddies.  The US has little if no role in the rest of the world, effectively allowing the government to disintegrate through Sunni/Shiite squabbles and corruption.  That's Obama's world view.  The US is not exceptional and doesn't deserve to exert its influence elsewhere, based on the fact that we were founded illegitimately by genocide and slavery.  In his view, the US need to be brought down a couple of pegs."

Then instead of signing a status of forces agreement like we did with Germany, Japan Italy, Spain, South Korea and others, to keep the region safe for Iraqis for years into the future, Obama withdraws all support and creates a much bigger problem by leaving a huge power vacuum, which anyone could see would be filled by the worst possible players on the world stage, radical Islam.  Of course, if you had been paying attention, a certain media personality told the nation that a caliphate is what they wanted back as far as 09, so you would know that those idiotic decisions would bring catastrophic loss of life and misery to millions.\n\nWhen we "invaded" Iraq, the people greeted us as liberators.

ISIS created ISIS.  Or, if you prefer, Al Queda (mostly) created ISIS.  And Bush didn\'t create Al Queda, either, he just sat around reading children\'s stories while Al Queda did 9/11.  \n\nAnd Bush didn\'t allow 9/11 to happen because he "ignored intelligence about planes used as weapons"; 99.9% of such threats never materialize.  If anything aided and abetted 9/11 other than Saudis, it was loose security and immigration policies in the USA which allowed the terrorists to be here, get commercial aircraft flight training, buy tickets, do dry runs of their scheme, take over airplanes with box cutters, etc.  We\'ve only addressed some of that.

aS'&gt;  Their incomes are growing\n\nAnd since taxes are based on income, so is the total amount of taxes that they pay. \n\n&gt;No, not hardly. They get back far more than they pay in.\n\nGetting back more than they pay in isn\'t an objective measure. By that measure, the people at the bottom, who pay no income tax but who receive government services don\'t pay their fair share either. \n\nThe fact remains that as a percentage of the totals, the income earned by the top few percent is actually a smaller portion of the total than the percentage of the total tax burden that they pay.\n\n\n&gt;If the tax was for only the people who made 10 mil a year or more,\n\nThe thing is I didn\'t see where the income level was stated. I remember that when Obama was running on the idea of taxing "the rich" more, it started at one number that everyone could agree was high but as soon as we started looking at how much revenue was required, it became clear that the income level would have to be a lot lower. He was talking about pretty massive tax increases on families making $250k per year. Yeah that\'s a lot better off than most, but for a family of 4, living in an expensive area, it\'s not exactly a lavish lifestyle. \n'

aS'It was a shit or get off the pot moment when Obama said it was time to leave. We\'d shown for close to a decade that our citizenry and our government did not have the will, and possibly even the ability, to prop up Iraq anymore. So we cut our losses. And it sounds bad, but sometimes that\'s the best choice. \n\n\nObama may have been unable to "fix" Iraq, which could probably have been said about anyone else as well, but it is not dumbed down one bit to say this is Bush\'s fault. And don\'t go putting on Rumsfeld, who served at the pleasure of the POTUS. '

aS'I apologize for any egregious stress my inquiry has caused.

Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the US and Iraq, we have met our responsibility. Now, it is time to turn the page."\n\n&gt; Mr Obama said the drawdown in Iraq allowed the US military to divert resources to the fight in Afghanistan, where he said the US remained committed to defeating al-Qaeda and the Taliban.\nBut he reiterated the mission in that country would last "a limited time" before Afghan security forces would have to take over.\n\n&gt; "As was the case in Iraq," he said, "we cannot do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves."\n\n\nIt seems to me Mr. Obama, at least when he was specifically addressing the issue of troops leaving Iraq in the early part of his Presidency, made some points perfectly clear.  We are done fighting in Iraq, because the rest needs to be done by Iraqis, but we are not done fighting al Qaeda.\n\nI can only assume either my search has been insufficiently thorough, or your recollection was based more on what you want to believe about the people you hate than, you know, actual memories.'

Al Asad Airbase had been a hotspot for quite some time, and enemy forces were repelled. But even if it did, let\'s go over some basic logic shall we?

aS'Tax cuts and regulation cuts obviously works. If you deny that, you are an idiot. Here is why: comparative advantage. Companies don\'t build here because its too expensive, and its annoying when Obama says you cant build in right to work states (lol). So making it cheaper encourages people to come to this country and discourages outsourcing. And the tax cut does not have to be huge. A 10% tax cut for a millionaire is equivalent to a 20% tax cut for someone making 100,000 dollars. Lets give historical examples. 1920\'s. taxes went from 73% to 25%, economy expanded 59%. No surprise, I would rather hire people if I had more money in my pocket too. A flat tax raises taxes on the poor and lowers them for the rich--Harvard economists predict that would create 5 trillion dollars (that means our economy would grow by 1/3!). Also, it makes sense, would I rather work harder when half of it is washed down the toilet, or when 10% of it is taken? Would I work harder if my secretary gets a tax cut but me--the only reason she is in the workforce--gets a tax hike? Higher taxes discourages innovation, expansion, and economic growth. Its Econ-101. Lower taxes would increase our comparative advantage and not "reward" outsources, it merely gives them a reason to return. And that\'s a fact (raising taxes on them makes them want to come back why?)'

aS'Oh Gawd, so much indoctrination.\n\nObama campaigned on bringing ALL of the troops in Iraq home.  He did not want to keep troops there.\n\nThen when challenged in public about it, he claims he wanted to keep 10,000 troops there.  It can\'t be both, either you support gay marriage (Obama circa 2009) or you don\'t (Obama circa 2014).  Of course, with the mountain of lies and waffeling, it makes it pretty challenging to separate the propaganda from the facts, but that\'s "You can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, you\'ll save $2500@yr" Obama for you.\n\nWhat you fail to address is that the SOFA negotiated by Bush was always meant to be renegotiated, and the Bush SOFA did not have immunity for U.S. personnel in it, so why did Obama insist on this being included in his SOFA?  Because it is a convenient excuse for a man who always publicly opposed the war, \'plausible deniability\'.\n\nHere is a little clip from the NYT to help jog your indoctrination:\n&gt;**And for the negotiators who labored all year to avoid that outcome, it represented the triumph of politics over the reality of Iraqs fragile securitys requiring some troops to stay, a fact everyone had assumed would prevail.** But officials also held out hope that after the withdrawal, the two countries could restart negotiations more productively, as two sovereign nations.\n**This year, American military officials had said they wanted a residual force of as many as tens of thousands of American troops to remain in Iraq past 2011 as an insurance policy against any violence.** Those numbers were scaled back, but the expectation was that at least about 3,000 to 5,000 American troops would remain.  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\n\nObama sabotaged the SOFA talks by adding a requirement he knew would be a deal breaker.\n\nEdit:  A little more on the sabotage. \nhttp://time.com/3453840/leon-panetta-iraqi-troop/'

Rather it almost seems like one of the two parties vying for control so they can implement their vision across the board, inevitably pissing off the other side.

aS"My points are several.  What you call 'stable' may not be what those in other countries call 'stable'.\n\nThe country was stable in the sense that Al Queda was not operating openly and killing Iraqi's and Americans, and Iraqi's were beginning to return to normal life, running businesses, living a normal daily routine.\n\nThat is not to say that the region was not subject to a sudden shift if left unattended, a stabilizing force was necessary.  Even as we were pulling the last troops we knew this.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\n\nBush negotiated a SOFA that did not have troop immunity as a part of it.  Obama insisted on this requirement at the last minute, causing the SOFA negotiations to fail.\n\nhttp://time.com/3453840/leon-panetta-iraqi-troop/\n\nIraq was not ready to take over it's own security, and it was well known, but Obama and his inner circle did not care, they just wanted to pull all the troops.  They would deal with the fallout as they have with many other fiasco's, they would just make up lies about it, and the media water carriers would just repeat the lie to the low information public.\n\nDo you think if we pulled all the troops out of 'stable' post WWII Germany in three years, that the Nazi's might have reconstituted?

aS'&gt; Let\'s not pretend the Obama administration isn\'t culpible and that their pulling out of Iraq despite the advice of many experts isn\'t without consequences. \n\nThe thing is though, he is still (in theory) elected by and represents the interests of the people.  The people were war-weary and clearly wanted to pull out of Iraq, and Obama campaigned on this.  I mean, it\'s not like he hasn\'t said "piss off" to campaign promises before, but let\'s also not pretend that Obama didn\'t have the voices of millions of Americans behind him telling him they were tired of the Iraq War.\n\nI\'m not really sure continuing a war unwanted by the people is the better option, especially since simply postponing the withdrawal a little longer would have dubious positive effect.  At best, it kicks the can down the road and hopes things are better at the time we *are* ready to pull troops.\n\nThere weren\'t many good solutions to a problem that, yes, was primarily in the lap of the Bush Administration.  We know now how they cherry-picked reports (despite clear warnings from other nations about validity of these reports) to craft a story to get done what the administration wanted done: War in Iraq.  That doesn\'t mean nobody else has made poor decisions (especially if you\'re talking about general destabilization in the region) that contributed to the problem, but it\'s pretty unquestionable at this point that we were misled into war by his administration.  There\'s a reason Iraq will always be Bush\'s albatross.\n\nAnd seeing as this thread is about his brother running for POTUS with very similar advisers, pointing this out is absolutely valid.'

aS"My argument isn't just that he can't win but that he has no hope of pulling off his agenda IF he ever got into office. Barack Obama was thwarted at every turn after he got elected in 2008 and that was with a Democratic House and Senate. And that wasnt an accident: Republican leadership were plotting as Obama was being sworn in. Hell, even members of his own party turned against Obama when it was politically convenient in an attempt to save their own seats. Not to mention two low turnout midterms which didn't do him any favors either.\n\nSo Bernie Sanders, Wildcard Socialist Democrat, will somehow grab the nomination, win the election by beating the billions in dark money being spent against him and his party, break the norm of Republican obstructionism, and usher in a new Golden Age of responsible governance where politicians of both parties get along and work together to help the people? Even the ones who didn't give them money? And do all of it without compromising the ideas that got him in office? I doubt it."

aS'Obama is not denying that they consider themselves Islamic. I mean, they\'re called the Islamic State, after all. \n\nHe\'s trying to distance the religion itself from a group that has specific political and ideological agendas; a group that justifies its ambitions using religious texts, but that\'s equally motivated by power and chasing historic glory. \n\nHypothetically, a Christian group could start endorsing slavery too:\n\n"Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive."\n- Titus 2:9-10\n\n"Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh."\n- 1 Peter 2:18\n\nAnd, especially if you included the Old Testament, you could start preaching some lousy things about infidels, women, gays, etcetera. But, most Christians would argue that this isn\'t in the true spirit of Christianity - and all that really means is that it doesn\'t reflect how modern Christianity has come to be practiced. And they\'d use the same language as Obama: "They\'re not Christian". \n\nSo that\'s what Obama is trying to do. And his motivation is strategic. Since there are billions of Muslims in the world, it makes more sense to rally them to our side against the extremists, then to attack a massive religion *itself*. I don\'t get why that\'s so hard for some folk to understand. \n\nHe\'s trying to undermine recruitment, and the right-wing attitude (no matter how much you think you\'re just calling a spade a spade) that Islam itself is the problem is feeding right into the narratives of these extremists. The more the right rails against Islam, the more the US seems anti-Islam, the more credibility the extremist narrative has.  \n\n'

Also, federally guaranteed student loans should be tied to performance and aptitude. There are way too many crap universities giving out crap degrees that have no economic value. Universities should be on the hook for defaults as much as the students are. Also student loans should be dischargable in bankruptcy. \n\nObama budgeted about a trillion dollars for "infrastructure." It got doled out to states and thrown into green projects and was largely squandered. \n\nThe same amount of welfare going to half as many people in the form of a single check every month would be the best possible shakeup of the welfare system.

What you actually want is for the will of the people to speak itself clearly, and elect leaders who can make informed and intellectually honest decision about the best things for their country, _even when that may go against popular opinion_.\n\nThe US has had those leaders throughout history, but recently seems to have had a whole run of them that don't understand this. The people, too, seem to have forgotten what they actually want.\n\nPersonally, I get the feeling that Sanders will not _just_ be the populist president, he would go his own way as much as Clinton, Bush or Obama have. The difference being that he would choose more ways that led to something better for the people in the end, rather than many other outcomes. He is smart, he has good ideas, and he seems genuinely intent on subverting the concept of how things are done in politics today.

aS'To clarify your misunderstanding of my position, I oppose all of the bad free trade deals that have been negotiated in the past, all of the bad trade deals that are sitting in the pipeline, the unconstitutional means by which they have been railroaded past Congress and the American people using fast track authority, incompetent/corrupt/self-serving politicians and U.S. trade negotiators, every single self-serving weasel responsible for this disgrace and every single trading adversary who cheats in order to tilt the balance of trade in their favor.  China is merely one of scores of global trade cheaters.\n\nI give China credit for one thing...they actually strive to serve their national economic interests and people as all governments should be doing.  Unfortunately, the U.S. is saddled with the most incompetent, self-serving and corrupt politicians and trade negotiators imaginable.  That\'s why the U.S. has had its ass handed to it on global trade ever since elitist morons thought Free Trade would be a "good idea".  Does that clear up your misconception?\n\n&gt;People are mad about a trade deal they haven\'t read, that congress hasn\'t voted on, and are extra angry that politicians represent special interests?\n\nSpare us the disingenuous Obama Administration bullshit.  Their underhanded PR tactics aren\'t lost on us.  We don\'t have to read their disgrace to smell the stench of it from a distance.  Everyone who ***HAS*** read TPP has confirmed everyone\'s concerns over it and revealed even more insidious elements than we\'re willing to support.  The leaked TPP provisions have been equally as damning.\n\n&gt;I get that capitalism and globalization are a problem but the TPP has nothing to do with that.\n\nYou\'re tragically mistaken.  TPP worsens the worst of Free Trade exponentially.  It\'s no different than trying to put out a fire with gasoline...it magnifies the problems rather than minimizing them.\n\nFor the record, I don\'t oppose capitalism.  Instead, I oppose reckless, self-destructive and irresponsible forms of capitalism.  Unfettered capitalism is a major problem since it suffers from more than a few counter-productive elements that pose a mortal threat to healthy economic activity.  Even arch-Conservative economist Milton Friedman recognized that fatal economic flaw.\n\n&gt;Jobs are going away to cheap labor havens and robots regardless...\n\nIf this point is true, you might as well tell the national economy and the American people to bend over and kiss their asses goodbye because the economy is destined to fail.  Without jobs and a middle class, healthy economic activity in the U.S. is ***impossible***.  Make no mistake, this isn\'t just a U.S. threat, it\'s a global threat.  If the U.S. economy fails, it will trigger a domino effect of failing markets around the world.\n\n&gt;the TPP and others allow America to open up new markets to trade goods and services.\n\nThat\'s a tragic lie and it has been since Free Trade was first dreamed up.  Here\'s [the irrefutable proof](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/balance-of-trade)...nothing but U.S. trade deficits resulted from Free Trade.  NAFTA was implemented in 1993, but feel free to pick any time period since the advent of Free Trade that suits you.  I already know you\'ll find the very same tragic trade policy failure outcome.  TPP won\'t register a dent in that ongoing economic damage.'

Congressional democrats are currently more liberal than they've been in 100 years. That's not speculation. That's data. \n\nThe problem isn't that democrats have been pulled right, it's political polarization. And more liberal democrats doesn't really solve that problem, but actually only makes it worse. While Clinton and Sanders are not all that different in terms of the actual policy they advocate, Clinton is far better at presenting her ideas in a way that hit a cord with the average American voter (thus the historically high approval rating and polling high for democrat voters).

That\'s how these grassroots campaigns of democratic candidates work these days. Obama had an unprecedented amount of small donations coming from individual donors. He did not want to give that up because that was individual people saying "I support your campaign, here is $100". Campaign finance reform is not about changing this.

People aren\'t attaching unrealistic expectations to him in the same way they did with Obama. He has almost zero media attention, by his own design he can\'t run a campaign on the scale Obama did because he won\'t play to game. This time during leading up to the 08 election Obama was edging closer to Hillary. Bernie is only a blip on her radar because no one else is even trying to run against her.'

For example, Mr. Obama asked for $32 million to repair part of the Amtrak rail system not covered by insurance, but the Senate multiplied that request more than tenfold, to $336 million, with the extra money going to cover Amtraks operating losses and to increase train capacity into New York City.\n\nThe Sandy recovery bill also includes more than $500 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which amounts to a full tenth of what the agency spends per year, nationwide.\n\nPart of that is $150 million for fishery disasters, which means money could flow to Mississippis blue crab and oyster industries, and to Alaska, where one senator said Chinook salmon have suffered."\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/16/porked-up-sandy-relief-bill-storms-into-senate/#ixzz3bSL9jYHX \n\n-------\n\nTed Cruz voted against the Sandy relief bill not because of aid to Sandy victims, but because it was rushed through even though only 36% of the funds were planned to be spent in the first two years, and because it was laden with additional pork projects to throw taxpayer money at projects that had nothing to do with Hurricane Sandy.\n\nEdit: sorry to interrupt the anti-Huckabee and anti-Cruz circlejerk.

I *was* the minority there.\n\nI am successful now and people I meet simply assume I grew up a privileged white dude with privileged white parents. I succeeded because of who I am, not due to the color of my skin or because of who my ancestors were. I didn't look up to white people because they were like me, I looked up to people who made something of themselves regardless of their background. I took pride in seeing people succeed who had drive, and ambition, and hope, because those are the people like me.\n\nThat said, I don't feel a connection or any amount of pride when a white male succeeds. Nor do I experience any more or less pride when someone who isn't white succeeds. I just can't imagine what benefit that gives someone. We can't, as a people, rally around ideals or feel a connection when anyone 'makes it'?\n\nRegardless of my political affiliation, I felt pride when Obama was elected because it represented us, as a people, making a statement. I feel pride when we as a people stand up for LGBT rights because it makes me proud to see the effect that 'good people' are having and I relate to 'good people'. I feel pride when I see anyone achieve anything in an admirable way because I'm people.\n\nTying your personal pride or personal worth to your ethnic heritage is something I simply do not and will not ever understand. We are people, and that's the only connection I need to share in someones success and happiness.\n\nFor the record: Manny Pacquaio is a bigoted asshole, and nobody should look up to him regardless of ethnicity."

If it was an open primary they aren\'t tied as closely to the party, but they still chose to vote in a non-official primary.

That the date violated DNC party rules makes no difference unless and until the DNC can dictate orders to a State government. Again, if the DNC wants to run their very own primary in Michigan with their own money, more power to them. They can then make up any rules they want as far as I\'m concerned.\n\nIt\'s also worth noting that the Michigan delegates were seated and were given their full original tally in votes, eventually. Didn\'t matter, because the "Super Delegates" picked the winner of the DNC primaries in a smokey back room, using a process that can only be described as "Not Democratic".\n\nAs much as I hear Democrats whine and bitch and moan about the "popular vote", the winner is decided by delegate counts and the popular vote total only needs to be "cooked" for propaganda purposes.

There\'s a huge number of roads and railways in need of upgrade and repair, something like $1 trillion in delayed work that hasn\'t been spent due to budget cutting.\n\n&gt;Despite increasing costs, there are still many state universities that I think are very affordable, and many community colleges that are an even better deal.\n\nObama is pushing for CC to be free at least, which is a start. A generation ago, a "budget" state school could cost maybe $100 per semester. Now tuition can be $5,000. A top flight public school is $30k. That\'s a good value?\n\n&gt;89% of Americans have health insurance.\n\n57% of bankruptcies are due to medical bills.

I like Bernie's policies and truly believe he'd be a good president; I just see Hillary as being better\n\nBernie also is from a pretty safe, liberal state and that was a distant cousin of mine that she beat (true story).

A real "shellacking" is Reagan\'s win over Mondale in 1984...that was an 18 point margin. \n\nObama has a great economic team, but he himself is rather weak on economics.  That came out in spades during the first presidential debate.  He has weaknesses that are evident to anyone that does not vote along party lines or has ingrained biases as to what "red" and "blue" look like.\n\nIMHO Obama is a great POTUS, but he\'s not nearly as popular as people (especially the media) make him out to be.'

The Romney camp knew that there were dozens of delegates that came from Romney held states that weren't actually legally required to vote for him and in fact fully intended to vote for Ron Paul. The unbelievably corrupt GOP remedied the situation by raising the number of states required to be on the ballot from 7 to 9 ON THE DAY OF THE CONVENTION effectively kicking Ron Paul off of the ballot. This was the perfect opportunity for the Liberal media to point out the corruption of the Republican party, but neither Fox nor CNN, MSNBC or the rest ever mentioned a word about Romney stealing the nomination.

The closest anyone but Warren has gotten is 42 points!  For her nearest competitor to be doing as well as Obama was even when factoring where they were in their campaign Sanders would need a 15 point swing of Clinton voters directly to Sanders voters, THEN it would be comparable to 2008 as long as Sanders can match her in campaign donations AND accelerate what was already an historical campaign from Obama.

aS'I agree with what you say, but I disagree that those are the main reasons the Democrats will take 2016. I\'ll post my analysis below for shits and giggles (note that its relatively out of context but it explains the advantage the Democrats have).\n\n&gt;I\'d like to get you to see just how electable Hillary actually is (despite what Reddit and Fox would like to have people believe). Even despite all the "scandals", her polling numbers haven\'t been affected. She is immensely popular among vast swathes of the country, and she is backed by not only name recognition, but a name that ties her to one of the most successful presidents in modern history (as opposed to Jeb Bush). \n\n&gt;This is without considering how well Obama has performed in the eyes of your average American (he brought the country out of a major recession and two wars as opposed to bringing it into them). Even the unpopular ACA has been successful at what it sought out to do so far (and it ended up costing less than anticipated).\n\n&gt;Couple that with a crippling Democrat defeat in 2014 (which will bolster Democrat support and keep some Republicans at home), a (so far) unpopular Republican congress, fighting within the GOP, and increased support for populist policies (more and more people are starting to see that the cards are stacked against your average person) which the GOP has little hope to compete against the Democrats at, I see this upcoming election as Hillary\'s to lose (as long as the country doesn\'t take a turn for the worst before then). If Morris Fiorina\'s Retrospective Voting model has any merit, the GOP has their work cut out for them.\n\n&gt;Like you I would prefer a Bernie Sanders style candidate, but (also like you), I am a pragmatist and see that he has no chance and the best way to avoid another GWB is to put your cards behind Hillary.'

aS'I will gladly elaborate. First of all, the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is that while the Republicans have NO ONE interested in helping out the middle class and the poor, the Democrats have Barry Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and a few others. Maybe half a dozen in Congress, total. But that still puts them well ahead of the Republicans.\n\nSecond, Obama\'s bailout was a success. Its intended goal was to halt the tailspin the economy was in and to help the economy recover fast. It did that. It also got the banks out of the mess they had created, but that was a side effect. Also, most of the money given in the bailout has been paid back.\n\nWhere Obama failed was in not also helping out all the middle class and poor homeowners who were hurt by the crash. Obama and his Democratic colleagues little or nothing to help out average Americans in that respect. There was a fund set up to help middle class homeowners, but it wasn\'t a big fund in relation to the banks, it was very slow to pay out and didn\'t actually get much done. A halfhearted effort, at best, of which Obama and the Democrats should be deeply ashamed. What\'s more, if the Democrats and/or Obama HAD made a real effort to help middle class homeowners, you can be SURE that the Republicans would have been howling like dogs about the expense of it.\n\nObama\'s deepest failure may have been in the area of justice: his justice department, presumably under his orders, refused to criminally prosecute any individuals for what they had done. They just prosecuted bank buildings and fined them what was for them small change. This was a huge moral failure on Obama\'s part, basically saying "It\'s OK to be a criminal if you\'re a big enough criminal." I was disgusted by it. And I know why it happened: Democrats like Wall Street campaign contributions just as much as Republicans do. In that respect, both parties are identical, with the exception of a handful of Democrats (Sanders, Warren and friends.)'

aS"Politics has always been about saving face and pandering. The problem with candidates these days is that they don't seem to understand that their support (the elderly, is dying off and rarely do they know how to raise support with the millennials (without pandering). Obama won because he got it. He promised a lot, but gave direct answers, didn't really BS us. I'm not saying he's the greatest president ever, but his (and Michelle's) legacy will ultimately be looked back on in a positive light. Bush on the other hand....?"

aS'Just give it for everyone trying to get out.\n\nImagine if half of the [41%](#s "vote Obama got in Texas in 2012") of Texas\'s 27 million people moved out of the state (a little less than 6 million).  Sure, the state would be 100% Republican, but it wouldn\'t be worth 38 electoral votes anymore (maybe 7-ish votes less).\n\nObviously that is bad math because Texas only had about 8 million votes cast out of an eligible pool of 18,279,737 (3.3 million for Obama in 2012).\n\nBut 1.6 million **actual voters** could sway a lot of states (and also increase those state\'s electoral value).  Other than Texas, the largest margin Romney won over Obama was Tennessee.\n\nRomney won...\n\n* Georgia\'s 16 EV by 304,861 votes.\n\n* North Carolina\'s 15 EV by 92,004 votes.\n\n* Tennessee\'s 11 EV by 501,621 votes.  (So probably skip it)\n\nI think Democrats start every Presidential election like 28 safe EV points shy of the win.  The first two states there are 31 points (and there are like 4 more states worth 9-11 points that need around 250,000 votes or less to have taken in 2012)'

aS"I find this hard to believe. Most analysts agree that major components to TPP will involve decreasing barriers on trading of environmentally friendly goods and services. The document is obviously still classified, but it's hard to imagine the Obama administration going forward with an agreement that didn't have strong environmentally friendly stipulations. The U.S. is the strongest force at the negotiating table for the TPP, and Obama is leading those negotiations. These outrageous claims that this deal will lead to China taking advantage of the U.S. seem absurd. The U.S. is leading the negotiations. Obama is leading the negotiations. We have the advantage here, no one else. Obviously we won't know what is in the trade agreement until it passes, but I'm just saying people aren't giving Obama enough credit for the fairly progressive agenda he has pushed while in office. Obviously part of these conclusions is influenced by my bias towards Obama. All I'm saying is that I am glad that Obama is leading these negotiations, and no one else."

aS'Is the EITC exclusively  superior to a minimum wage hike?  The Republican Party has been playing a long game designed to wreck the New Deal.  My point is not about the effectiveness of the EITC,  it\'s about the Republican desire to avoid raising the minimum wage with something that basically fits into the narrative of \'big government bad.\'  Same with increasing the debt:  the largest debt increases are by Republicans,  by design in order to wreck the New Deal (&amp; offset that trickle down doesn\'t work). Turns out voting for the IETC  didn\'t have that effect and many of the people who voted for it on the right may have done so in good faith...*i argue many did not.* \n\n\nAs for min wage vs. EITC: hey both work, with the EITC a success.   *At this point I see the lack of a minimum wage increase acting as a disincentive for the American workforce.* The investor class has decided they are keeping the efficiency increases capitalism has acquired over the last few decades, and while we all have iPhones and jeans are still cheap, there have been huge increases in unavoidable costs like housing, education, healthcare, commuting.  The American workforce surmise they\'ve been getting screwed when the wealthy have gone from rich to obscenely rich, whose intelligence, hard work *and increased control of govt*  paid off, but not in proportion to their contribution.   They took advantage of the increases of efficiency within the system *for which they are not solely responsible*.  Some of those increased efficiencies have been by reducing regulations and protections and the polluted wastelands of Asia and lack of adequate savings for many Americans are testament to that.\n\nThere\'s three or four people who gave away the keys to the tech economy when they had the right to own it.  Who deserves the result?  Did i climb to the top myself or am I standing in the shoulders of Giants, the ladder built by someone else?\n\n\nIts been 25 years since school...by the time I was done, I was pretty cynical.  Prompted by my Professor,  our research correctly surmised we would have cyclical and increasingly more devastating bubbles and crashes.  One of my frat brothers who works in investments confided: \'we expect a bubble about every 10-12 years now, it will be pushed up, the big boys have the edge to pull out and buy back in when it is low.  That\'s a gross oversimplification, but the fact that many high level stockbrokers view it this way is beyond disturbing.   No one wants to talk about the fact that in 2009 the market should have leveled off about 900...but was pushed down into the 600\'s in order to get back the losses the big boys incurred ...and scare Obama. \n\n\nThere\'s a new ethos:  we do not have to share the wealth.  An arguable point, but unfortunately perception is reality, and the perception is workers are getting screwed.  It\'s interesting, we will bend over backwards to support a brutal dictatorship with resources, but our own workers deserving a proportional increase of the larger pie they baked are "takers".\n\n Mid 20th century reformist  capitalists correctly surmised vast, concentrated wealth is inherently dangerous to democracy.  Today\'s economists think it\'s a good thing.  Bill Gates walks into a bar, woopie, we\'re all statistically richer!\n\n As I like to point out,  Adam Smith did not invent happiness.  He just showed it can be damn more accessible.  Unfortunately greed means people are told to take more more more or they won\'t be happy... and it worked.  Look at the behavior on Black Fridays.  You can\'t blame liberals or communism for it.\n\n\nSorry that\'s a long, windy bit veering off the minimum wage and the methods with which we legislate against poverty.   Hopefully those expanded ideas are clear.\n\nYou live in a world of global banks one of the steps to get too there in our nation was an orchestrated destruction of the savings and loan industry.  My cynicism that the EITC was voted on by Republicans for their own ulterior motives stands.  Like so many progressive programs are very effective and so they keep them this is just one they decided not to attack... it means we\'re not raising wages, which they love.'

aS'I dont think I\'ve had as much coffee as you... :)\n\nAt a high level...\n\n\nYes, health care costs were going up before and after ACA. But look at the jumps in the before and after. Many people have seen deductibles double or triple. "Like your insurance keep your insurance" was a bullshit line that got the suckers to support it. ACA plans are decidedly worse than pre ACA plans middle class people had. Whats worse is soon we\'ll also get to be taxed on them. So yeah, fuck ACA, fuck Obama and fuck all his knuckle dragging supporters. \n\n\nMinimum wage without question hurts everyone making more than minimum wage. Firstly, if you made 15 an hour when minimum wage was 5 and the minimum goes up to 10, you are now that much closer to the bottom. Even worse, business passes the costs on to consumers. So when the business has to pay more in labor then just raise prices a bit. Which means that now your cost of living goes up. Certainly not by a large amount, but the fact remains minimum wage hurts everyone but the least successful in society.\n\n\nThe big confusion is in the presentation of how the rich hurt the system. You see, the liberals have brainwashed people into thinking if a government hasnt *taken* money from you, its the *same thing* as if the government *gives* you money. Thats decidedly a lie. If the government gives a tax break to a rich person that indivudual simply gets to keep more of what he has. The government hasnt *given* him money. Conversely if the government sends a check to a poor person the government has *given* that person money he was not in any way entitled to.

The question also implies Obama did something to improve the economy and, since the survey purposely over sampled Republicans, inserting his name is fishing for a negative answer.

aS'I mean, yeah I agree in principal with that stance. But what I guess I am getting at is that I see Obama as more of an opportunist that a true authority fetishist. He knows constitutional law, so I\'m betting he knows that the authority for things like the Patriot act are unconstitutional. I think he is taking advantage of laws implemented by the previous administration. I don\'t see a world where Obama came into office and tried to promote new legislation like the patriot act had it not already been implemented with zero political ramifications for him. It\'s similar to the "looking forward, not back" policies he used to let him keep a lot of the bush drone killing programs. He wouldn\'t dare put his name under new laws for that shit, because he acts like he is too worried about his historical legacy.'

aS"The easiest path to the White House for the GOP starts with Florida. They MUST win Florida to have any chance at the White House. That's 29 EV, but they still need another 35 to win uncontested.\n\nThe next two states to peel off are Ohio and Virginia which Obama just barely won by 3% and 4% respectively. That gets them 31 EV which is close but not close enough to win. Now in terms of margins of victory, you'd be tempted to look somewhere like Colorado or Pennsylvania - states Obama won by about 5%. But Colorado is increasingly blue and Pennsylvania is not only an uphill battle it's incredibly expensive to campaign there. Plus at 20 EV it's overkill.\n\nInstead you peel off New Hampshire. It's 4EV, which is exactly what you need to win, and Obama's margin of victory was only 5.5%. In terms of actual votes, that's about 45,000 people you need to flip, which is a stupidly small number of votes. \n\nThe only reason I see to go after Pennsylvania instead of New Hampshire would be if it looks like the Republicans will lose North Carolina, in which case they will need Pennsylvania. (But if they're losing NC they've probably lost the election anyway, so I wouldn't worry.)\n\nSo no they don't need Pennsylvania. It's a crown jewel, surely. But not necessary and probably unwinnable.  Instead expect a fight in FL, OH, VA and NH as well as a concentrated effort to hold NC with a token effort in PA that will intensify if NC becomes problematic to hold (which is itself a bad sign for republicans)."

aS"Well supreme court nominations is pretty important,  you got me there. But what Obama has actually done for climate change (other than lip service)? The only thing I can think of is continuing support of the renewable energy tax credit, which I think repubs only counter since dems support it. I mean bush started it and it actually is more in line with republican ideas then democrates with its business and industry support though tax relief. So it's quite possible Romney would have done the same. \n\nOn the supreme court front, it's why I hope they (who ever wins) only nominate narrow constitutionalist. The position lasts too long to try push a political agenda through there. Better to do change in Congress and the states then in the courts.

I'm not saying you don't need to be concerned about it, but to cite random lawsuits that won't stand up in court as your defense against these trade deals is a pretty weak argument.\n\nYes we don't know what the TPP says, but we do know that Obama is the lead negotiator in this trade deal and that on many occasions he has emphasized the role that health and environmental protections will have in this trade deal. I'm not saying that you can necessarily trust what he says or that this is proof that this deal will protect average people, I'm just saying that with the evidence we have there is no reason to believe all the ridiculous claims being made about this trade deal. \n\nObviously I wish things like this could be more transparent, but that's not the world we live in. These deals center around hard fought negotiations where each negotiating party wants every possible advantage. Leaking what is being negotiated only hurts their standing. \n\nThe fact is, this deal will happen and the average American won't have much say in what is in the deal other than their voice in electing Obama. We can debate what Obama will concede or what advantages he will give to corporations, but right now we don't know. And we won't know until the deal is done. Again all I am saying is I would much prefer Obama getting this deal done over pretty much any other politician in America. For many that's not enough. And I get that. I'm just voicing my opinion on this topic."

Simply being President while the economy recovered is not proof that he is the cause.\n\nYou\'re correct that not everyone in the public has all the information to make a decision regarding international trade. But that is beside the point. We don\'t elect leaders to keep secrets from us or treat us like children.\n\nThe Obama administration\'s position with regard to illegal wiretaps has been that if you don\'t have anything to hide, you shouldn\'t mind your privacy being invaded. Well now the shoe is on the other foot.

That *is* a large number, but since many of those numbers are quantifiable (they know how much they accidentally paid to the wrong recipients, which companies had "rounding errors", etc) what\'s left over is all that such abuse could possibly total, *ever*. It\'s a couple of percent at worst. It\'s below the thresh-hold of giving a shit really, because of two things: It proves that current fraud and abuse prevention methods are working, and working well; and because numbers that low in a system that big usually mean the solution would end up costing more money than the problem, so only an idiot would waste that money chasing it.\n\nI\'m a fiscal conservative. The welfare abuse "problem" is about as valid as the quest to prove Barack Obama is a muslim-born kenyan communist. \n\nThe numbers are there. Please, in all seriousness, google them.

aS'Because many of us that supported him did so with realistic expectations. I never carried the "Obama is the savior of the US" mindset, many didn\'t. in 2008 McCain lost me when he started playing by the Karl Rove playbook and pretty much ditched those of us in the center in favor of the right wing. Romney did the same thing.\n\nThe Obama years haven\'t been the awful trainwreck many try to make it out to be. There have been issues, and he certainly wasn\'t the candidate that he appeared to be initially, but again I supported him with realistic expectations. Though I won\'t credit him directly for it, we have seen massive social strides towards the acceptance of the LGBT community with no political pushback from the administration. Unemployment is down and the stock market is up, the ACA could have been smoother but it isn\'t a massive failure either. \n\nI have yet to regret voting for Obama over the other candidates on the field.

aS"I'm going to step in here and explain why everyone is freaking out saying Social Security is going bankrupt.\n\nFirst.  Yes.  The entire Social Security Trust Fund was used to expand the budget for decades.  All that remains in the coffers is Special Issue Treasury Bonds.  We owe ourselves about 3 Trillion Dollars, not including other intragovernmental debt.  Regardless of what people tell you.  You cannot owe yourself money, be broke, and simultaneously have that money.  It isn't possible.  As Social Security goes into negative numbers, the money from the Trust Fund will have to be borrowed on a yearly basis, increasing the deficit, as we do not have the money and the forecast is for budget deficits as far as the eye can see.\n\nBut honestly, the real problem isn't social security.  We can deal with Social Security as a single problem.  The big problem is Medicare and Medicaid. These programs weren't designed to deal with the current medical world we live in, where people live longer, and get to use all the wondrous medical technology we have invented.  Not to mention the sweetheart deals we give Big Pharma, and the COMPLETE failure of healthcare reform.  I'm sure most people don't understand. What we got from the Affordable Care Act was the POLAR OPPOSITE of why Obama tried to press through Healthcare Reform.  It was supposed to drive down costs significantly, but the Health Insurance Lobby under their lead negotiator Karen Ignagni completely reneged on the deals she made with Obama.  So Obama had to pass something as far too much political capital had been expended to back off...\n\nAccording to  the Congressional Budget office.  By 2030, all we will be able to afford with our income is Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt.  Everything else will have to be borrowed.  Military. Highways. Coast Guard.  Whatever pet project you like that the Federal Government does...  NASA, NOAA&lt; whatever... Everything else will be borrowed. Everything.\n\nBy 2050.  All we will be able to afford is the interest on the debt.\n\nCan you comprehend what they are saying?\n\nSome debt is good.  We are long past that point.  The time for action was honestly about 2 decades ago.  It isn't about finding a way out of our problem anymore.  It is about making the catastrophe as small as possible.  We are well past the point of no return.  We have some very tough choices to make.\n\nBut nothing is being done.  And nothing will be done.  Until the last minute.  Because to do something now would be political suicide.  And the politicians are far more worried about their careers and special interests than they are about what is good for this country.\n\nSo instead of making some tough choices now.  We are going to wait until the world drops the US Dollar as the Worlds Reserve Currency.  When they realize that the US Dollar is going to tank, someone is going to start selling a lot of T-Bonds.  It will be like a run on a bank.  Once it starts it will spread like wildfire.\n\nAnd we will enter the Second Great Depression.\n\nUnless we start doing something.\n\nI'm not holding my breath."

I agree with the others that the democratic party has more tolerance when it comes to multiple voices in the party.  In my experience, when it comes to the republican party, differing perspectives cause more animosity between supporters and the candidates.  However, I don't think this is just a thing about democratic vs. republican parties.  The animosity that emerged in the republican party over the past two election cycles was in reaction to the George W Bush administration.  A share of the republican party rejected Bush and instead turned to Ron Paul.  This rift hurt Romney in 2012, especially because Paul's platform was rejected by the republicans on many major issues.  Unless there emerges a segment of the democratic party that proves deeply dissatisfied, I don't see liberals turning on each other just because new candidates enter the race.  Obama has not caused that same intra-party dissatisfaction that Bush caused.  My only concern about adding more liberals to the mix is the effect it might have on Clinton's campaign.  Assuming she is the nominee, I think she benefits most from having as centrist a platform as possible.  The more Clinton moves left, the more traction the republicans will gain against her since she will lose independent votes."

Well I don\'t think American elections should be bankrolled by America\'s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."

Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president."[67] Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat, stated that it was "the worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case, and that the court had opened the door to political bribery and corruption in elections to come.[68] Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards, along with constitutional law professor and Maryland Democratic State Senator Jamie Raskin, have advocated petitions to reverse the decision by means of constitutional amendment.[69] Rep. Leonard Boswell introduced legislation to amend the constitution.[70] Senator John Kerry also called for an Amendment to overrule the decision.[71] On December 8, 2011, Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the Saving American Democracy Amendment, which would reverse the court\'s ruling.\n\nThe Supremes got it wrong.  Some of them (Alito) obviously never understood what it was about: power and disenfranchisement.\n\nNaturally someone who supports the pink satin pants would try to claim that opponents "support a rewrite of the first amendment."\n\n\n&gt; The Supreme Court reversed this decision, striking down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from making independent expenditures and "electioneering communications".\n\n&gt; The United States Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by a nonprofit corporation. The principles articulated by the Supreme Court in the case have also been extended to for-profit corporations, labor unions and other associations.\n\n\nAll that\'s from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC\n\nWhat I get alarmed at is the flagrant attempt to make this only "about the first amendment" and raise up the kind of entity we fought against, a corporation, just to be free, just to be a country.\n\nThat seems really shabby to me.'

While that is nice and all, both parties are basically car salesman who SELL you on your beliefs. \n\nAlmost every major Republican/Democrat pretty much share the same foreign policy/ major domestic programs. And that never changes. What we need more than ever, is a president that puts an end to this madness. That finally puts a stop to the foreign policy we\'ve had for 40 + years. \n\nAnd Rand is that person. I\'m a liberal progressive, and there are a lot of things I don\'t agree with him on. BUT...there is a system in place with checks and balances, and no libertarian president is going to be able to go in and completely change everything. But we need a strong person that is 100% legit in wanting to change our foreign policy (which is all about intervention)...as well as stopping major domestic programs like the NSA spying. I\'m female, and of course I care about things like abortion. But I\'m not going to vote for candidates that will continue NSA spying/foreign policy, just because they support abortions.\n\nRand is that person. Him and Ron Paul had a very consistent record of voting against these things (unlike Sanders and Warren). I\'m tired of people voting for people in their party because they "aren\'t crazy"..and then those same stooges end up letting you down, and pulling the same shit their past admins do.\n\nI truly believe a lot of our problems stem from our foreign policy. And a lot of major domestic programs like the NSA spying, will have HUGE ramifications later down the line. I really truly believe, it\'s time to vote someone in like Rand who will finally make major substantial changes. Changes that Obama promised and didn\'t deliver on. And while I get congress has impeded most of what he wanted, there is no excuse for how Obama has continued Bush Era foreign policy/ domestic programs like spying. Obama fell in like like a little bitch, and just continued. \n\nWhat I\'ve learned is, admins almost NEVER give up power that the previous admin had. Once power is there, once it\'s been established...no current admin wants to give up that power. And that is a very dangerous thing, when we have insanely unconstitutional programs like the NSA spying stuff.  \n\nEDIT: If you are going to downvote me, at least have the courage to reply and explain why you don\'t agree with me.

It was simply an example of industry impact under the authority of the EPA.\n\nSpecifically to the Obama EPA actions, it was that the EPA changed the rules for itself and it granted itself sweeping powers against industry in general without a Congressional act.

If I want to vote for the politician that has the best hair or the best body or which one I think can eat a hot dog the fastest that\'s my right. There\'s no requirement that my decision be informed on the candidates records or platforms. \n\n&gt; Did you leave out that part of the quote because you disagree that people who are voting should make informed choices based on facts?\n\nI agree that they should: I hope they do, but if they don\'t or don\'t want to, I support their right to do that as well\n\n&gt;Nothing is stopping individuals from researching their candidates platforms.\n&gt;\n&gt; So because the truth is out there for your average citizen, like a low-rent Fox Mulder, to find, it\'s ok to simply lie about candidates in the national media, over public airwaves?\n\nI have no idea what a low rent fox milder is. Yes: lying is still speech.\n\nIf I want broadcast on my YouTube channel and say: Obama is socialist, 24/7 that\'s my right. If me and my buddies wana host a radio talk show where all we do is fantasize about how great Bernie sanders will be and how he will guide us to mars that is our right to express our speech in that context\n \nUnless you believe the government should have the power to control our context of speech and control what is allowed to be said and not. Essentially giving government the power to dictate speech \n\n&gt;Speech\n&gt;\n&gt; Money is not speech.\n\nCorrect, but money spent in the promotion or due exercise of an action such as speech is protected and punished as that action \n\nBuckley v Valeo is a great court case on this issue \n\n&gt;So you want the government to limit how many candidates can run for government\n&gt;\n&gt; No, I want Public Financing of Elections.  Actually what I really want is to separate politicians from money interests.  I want the people elected to examine policy scientifically and to try to best represent the views of the entire area they represent, instead of the narrow interests represented by their highest donors.\n\nNo you said you wanted candidates from 4 to 5 parties. If there is public financing of elections: what if 100,000 people decide to run for office?\n\nLet\'s focus on something you said\n\n* I want the people elected to examine policy scientifically and to try to best represent the views of the entire area they represent, \n\nWhat if the constituents of the area a congress person represents do not want him to examine it scientifically. Let\'s say they don\'t believe in evolution of global warning?\n\nThen what?\n\n&gt;Money spent in the promotion of speech is protected as that speech.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bullshit.  Money has nothing to do with speech.  \n\nSaying bullshit: isn\'t an argument. As noted above, there\'s a good court case on this issu\n\nBuckley v Valeo\n\n&gt; It\'s completely separate.  It is not related at all.  \n\nActually it\'s greatly related. Me spending $10 to buy a shirt and ink to write a message on my shirt is me spending money to promote my speech\n\nMe buying markers and protest signs is me spending money to promote and exercise my speech\n\nMe buying ad time is me spending money to promote and exercise my speech\n\n&gt; There\'s all sorts of things the government doesn\'t allow you to spend money on.

Money spent on things illegal (cocaine) is also illegal.\n\nThanks for supporting my point that:\n\n* There\'s all sorts of things the government doesn\'t allow you to spend money on. \n\n\n\n&gt; Your ability to buy space on media platforms is not a protected right.  The TV news can decline to publish your "speech", as has been done in the past.  \n\n\nCorrect and I support that right as well\n\n&gt; The Green Party and other 3rd parties in the United States have trouble getting ads on television in big markets during political seasons, because the networks tend to reject 3rd party ads.  It\'s done all the time.  \n\n\nMainly because they can\'t afford them \n\n&gt; I support the freedom of people to express their speech.  That\'s what free speech is all about.  It must be protected\n&gt;\n&gt; You choose to reject any limitation on the expenditure of money in the furtherance of speech.\n\nNo: I choose to support the judicial principle of \n\n* Money spent in the promotion or due exercise of an action is protected and punished as that action.\n\nTo limit the spending of money on speech, government must first limit the speech. To do this, government must pass the strict scrutiny test \n\nFor example: broadcasting treasonous speech that for example tells of location of our soldiers in combat is illegal and thus the government has passed the strict scrutiny test\n\n&gt; understand your position already.  But that didn\'t answer my question, which was how you justify that view.  \n\nBecause to me: the opposite is worse\n\nGiving or allowing government the power to control what Individuals can say or spend money on to say when it\'s simply political is opening the door for tyranny \n\nIf 20 years from now you feel as if president John Doe is about to become a dictator. I want to support your right to spend money or get donations and broadcast your message.\n\nI don\'t want to give government the power to say:\n\n"This is political speech: you can\'t say that"\n\n&gt; This Tsunami of money has had an effect, and that effect has been to silence anyone who isn\'t able to raise that kind of money.  Not through censorship, but simply by burying them, like proverbial needles in haystacks.\n\nIts impossible to bury someone. You are speaking right now: you are not buried any candidate can do an AMA or go on cnn or launch a blog\n\nRemember: the right to be heard doesn\'t exist \n\n&gt; find it strange that you object so strenuously to any limitation on money being spent to further speech, but give no care to the obvious silencing of people who cannot muster such resources.\n\nBecause they aren\'t being silenced. They can talk all they want. No one is stopping them\n\n&gt; And since that money can now be provided by much smaller groups of individuals, this kind of silencing is only increasing, the money not only silences people who are opposed, it silences people who support the candidate, because the candidate doesn\'t have to worry as much about them, he can address his concerns to the needs of his highest donors.\n\nThen don\'t vote for him '

And don't pretend like the consevative politicians are all racists who don't help anyone. Just as bad as saying Obama is literally hitler."
