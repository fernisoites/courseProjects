aS"China invaded them back in '79, pulled out after a while. If they really wanted to, they could, but it would be messy.\n\nThe Chinese aren't interested in the Vietnamese mainland though; so an invasion wouldn't be necessary.

aS'It was China specifically which the news of the day regarded.  China is the nation pulling the largest harvest from these waters, according to the article linked.  So the news story here is *news* regarding the largest state actor with respect to this issue.  \n  \nComplaining about your straw-man, who isn\'t sufficiently acknowledging the acts of other nations in this area, is nonsensical.  As you yourself say, the article acknowledges the role of other nations *in its very first sentence*.  \n  \nEven *were* anyone ignoring these parties (which is unlikely, since your post is currently right at the top of the page and they are named in the first sentence of the article), I would *still* fail to see your point.  When it comes to conservation issues, we *do* need to worry about the policy actions of individual state actors.  We do need to report on them.  There\'s news today, on the subject of Chinese policy in this area.  And what\'s more, they\'re the largest state actor by volume of catch!  If reporting that *still* offends you, I suspect you\'ve got a bias at work which prefers information pertaining to the nation in question not be reported, on issues of this kind.  But more likely, this was just the usual "Redditor strikes a blow against Reddit\'s secret bias" nonsense.  '

I understand sovereignty, I am just saying Tibet may not be recognized at it's current size but it does in fact still have undisputed claim of parts of it's region."

aS'Eh, on other hands, the western culture changed to make homosexuality a "sin" (via Christianity). Japan never changed.

aS'They have to go by the rules. Fishing around Antarctica is governed by the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, (CCAMLR). China Signed the Treaty. They should comply with international fishing regulations. \n\nProblem is that the catch limit at 4 million metric tons is likely too high, and China is planing to take advantage of that opportunity. They still have to report the catch numbers. If they reach that limit it will be controversial to say the least.\n\nWith Australia enforcing the rules, the boats will have to keep some tight numbers. This would not be the first time Australia would be busting the books open and laying charges. '
p82
aS"Take new measures, then? Instead of writing some poorly researched drivel about China expanding their already low catch rate of krill when they're within the governing body's limits (current catch rate is 1/50th of the estimated allowable limit).\n\nI have a hard time believing there's any harm unless proven, as krill are [the most plentiful species on earth by biomass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_krill). China is also nowhere near the top catchers of Krill, which are in order: [Norway, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Poland (2009, most recent year available)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill_fishery).\n\n"
p83
aS"According to OP's article, the catch limit is 4.2 million metric tons. Current self-reported world capture is at 239,950 metric tons. China has self-reported 32,000 metric tons. I doubt that China has failed to report over 3 million metric tons of krill capture. That amount of krill wouldn't go unnoticed. Maybe China has failed to report tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of metric tons. But almost a few million metric tons of Antarctic krill would absolutely be noticeable.\n\nSources:\n\nUN's Fisheries and Aquaculture Department dataset - http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-capture-production/query/en (it's a pain in the ass to sort through the data, but you can find self-reported capture of Antarctic krill per country from 1950 - 2013) \n\n"

China settled 17 of its 23 territorial disputes since the communists took over, and conceded more than 50% of their claims (all land disputes except with India and Bhutan). China also attempted twice to settle disputes with India pre- and post-war on lines of actual control, but India rejected both attempts. It\'s a poor attempt at bullying, if that was their intention.\n\nThe Sino-Indian war according to declassified CIA papers place the blame mostly on India, and the Sino-Vietnamese war started by Vietnam invading China\'s ally Cambodia. There is no UNCLOS regarding China\'s sea disputes as China has explicitly exempted those disputed areas when they signed (also the US did not sign). Artifical islands also do NOT act as extension of territories, and the concern is over China using the artificial island as an airstrip not a territorial extension.\n\nAs for "ecological catastrophe", perhaps you should concern yourself with the Philippines\' habit of blast fishing that have done far worse to the marine environment in the region.'

aS'&gt;What is ur standard of well? Economy, look at china. They persevere and become a giant. It may or may not work well in other areas but again, ur standard of "well" may be different from others. Don\'t throw in more arguments like human rights. Legalizing any substance is and still currently viewed as not acceptable for most countries (you said so as well).\n\nOkay, lets get into pointing out how your mix and match refuting my argument is bullshit shall we.  China is a military dictatorship in the guise of socialist capitalism, not a communist state regardless of what the claim.  Considering we are arguing the validity and morality of the death penalty, China\'s lack of respect for human rights is most certainly valid.  \n\nSpeaking of China, they have been regularly reducing the number of crimes punishable by death and they have also been consistently dropping the number of executions they conduct.  \n\nMy use of communism was to point out that *although* a system may look good in theory, the practical application is shit.  It was not to discuss whether communism has been successful anywhere or not.  SPOILER:  Communism has never worked in practice.  Not once.  Even Soviet Russia was never at any point in its existence a communism.  It was again a dictatorship that utilised socialist principles to govern the masses.\n\n&gt;But whatever, u are again throwing new subjects in the discussion. \n\nYour difficulty at keeping up with the arguments presented and how they are all related is not really my problem.  I have offered to assist in you comprehending what I am saying and you chose to laugh that off.  If you cannot be polite and see that I was being genuine, itu salah kamu bukan salah aku.\n\n&gt;You are confusing at most times\n\nAgain, not my problem.  I am speaking very concise and well structured English.  You wanted to get into this debate.  I agreed that Australia\'s policy towards drugs is not progressive and provided much evidence that prohibition does not work.\n\nThis was highlighted to show you that the Indonesian system instituting the death penalty for possession and trafficking of drugs is ridiculous, because there is a lot of evidence to show that prohibition of substances *in itself* is a stupid policy.\n\nNow if you are talking my argument regarded *more progressive nations*, then yes, most of Europe and Australia are far more progressive than Indonesia both politically and legally.  The reasons for this are many and varied, as Indonesia is a complex nation.\n\n&gt;That is in one fucking response dude. Be consistent, even when u lie, be consistent. Hehehhee\n\nI provided you with extensive links and evidence resulting from thorough research that this is the case.  I am tired of being polite, so if you are too fucking stupid or too fucking blind to understand the facts placed in front of you, then you are one of the problems with this world.  Your ridiculous one eyed bullshit exacerbates conflict and social issues, and worst of all *you aren\'t even willing to learn!*. Grow up man.\n\n&gt;What u are agreeing to is "an eye for an eye" principle.\n\nSee now you\'re being disingenuous again.  It is hypocritical of a government that is willing to execute foreign nationals to request clemency for it\'s own citizens.  I am not agreeing with an eye for an eye principle at all. \n\nI am *talking* about the hypocrisy of this act and the rightful calls of the nations that do not participate in this unjust practice for clemency of their own nationals.  No country has requested a pardon, they agree with the arrest and detention of their nationals, but they in principle do not agree with the death penalty. \n\nIf 140+ nations do not practice the death penalty, it is the majority of the planet that disagrees with the death penalty.  So yes, nations that still implement capital punishment should be judged harshly and condemned for their actions. \n\n&gt;Is it unjust during the trial or the former issues?\n\nThis makes no sense.\n\n&gt;U think i don\'t understand English? Lol...wow...as a so-called person who deals with legal matters regularly, I am truly disappointed at ur level of arguments and assumptions. What actually do u do if i may ask?\n\nYou may definitely not ask.  I assume as such because if you can understand English well enough to comprehend what I am telling you, you would not say half of the rubbish that you have been spouting.  Taking one out of context and willfully misrepresenting what they are trying to say is an indication of one clutching at straws.\n\nIf your language comprehension is *good* then you wouldn\'t be so ridiculous and hyperbolic with the rubbish that you\'re saying and trying to obfuscate the argument.\n\nAnd ffs learn some basic Reddit formatting, such as quoting, so your the mess that you spew forth onto your keyboard is somewhat readable.\n\n'

aS'I just checked your facts on this because this seemed to be drastically against the grain of everything else I know about sustainable fishing.  I\'m presenting the stats of the articles I found and nothing more, which both agree and disagree with you.  I think the issue here is that the impact of fishing krill is not at all fleshed out, and not whether we are very far or not from the amount that will cause reproductive failure of the population.\n\n__\n\nScientists believe krill have declined by 80 per cent since the 1970s, and the most likely cause is global warming. There is uncertainty, though, about the remaining population: the BAS estimates 100 million tonnes; krill harvesting companies claim about 400-500 million tonnes. Under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the annual allowed krill catch in the Southern Ocean is 4 million tonnes. But until now there has been \'huge under-fishing\', usually less than 20 per cent of that quota, said Tarling. [SOURCE](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/23/fishing.food)    \n\n__\n\nAs the PEW Environment Group commented in 2010: how can you certify a single operator or a few ships if you want to guarantee the sustainability of an entire fishery? If a few ships are acting responsibly, but the vast majority are not, the target population could still be at risk of being overfished. Aker BioMarine boasts of a no-by-catch policy, but some scientists are deeply worried about the by-catch of larval fish. The existing data on Krill abundance, reproductive strategies, life history and population variables are meager. No management regime or eco certification scheme can capture these uncertainties and indeterminacies adequately in their models so the claim of sustainability and the management tools are built on a shaky foundation. The impact of long-term environmental change is also difficult to incorporate in these models. The growing Krill fishing industry is adding to the pressure of environmental changes that are already threatening Krill. Human-forced climate change being the most prominent. Krill larvae feed on micro-algae living on the bottom of sea ice where a small layer of melt water forms a nursery. Adult Krill will overwinter there as well. The winter sea ice cover is rapidly dwindling around the Antarctic Peninsula, which has the fastest rising temperatures of the planet, 2.5 degrees C in the last 50 years.\n\nReproductive failure in Krill as a result of dwindling sea ice is a real risk and will result in breeding failure in birds and seals. Some of these effects are already visible. According to one 2004 estimate, based on data covering 40 Antarctic summers, the amount of Krill in the Southern Ocean may have dropped by 80% since the 1970s. This makes the MSC health of stock assessment questionable to say the least.[SOURCE](http://www.seashepherd.org/commentary-and-editorials/2013/04/16/krill-fisheries-the-next-collapse-605)\n\n__\n\n\nOne issue for debate will be the CCAMLR\'s annual catch limit of 3.47 million tonnes in the Atlantic-bordering section of the Southern Ocean, the main fishing ground for Antarctic krill. "Current krill management fails to take account of the subtleties of the ecosystem," says Volker Siegel, a marine biologist at the Institute for Sea Fisheries in Hamburg, Germany, and member of the European Union\'s CCAMLR delegation. Siegel says that rather than setting an ocean-wide limit, krill fisheries should be regulated on a smaller scale, because much of the fishing is limited to a few sites.\n\nAnother worry is the number of fishing vessels being deployed in the Southern Ocean. Norway is now operating three ships, for example, and China is expected to rapidly increase its krill fishing after sending its first vessel this year. "If China starts fishing in a big way, catch will expand rapidly, outstripping our ability to orderly manage it," says Steve Nicol, a marine ecologist with the Australian Antarctic Division in Kingston, Tasmania, who advises the Australian government on krill fisheries.[SOURCE](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100901/full/467015a.html)'

This is what is being implied even if not explicitly stated verbatim.   \n\nIf Iceland exports its capture, the statistical method being used to tally up this data for per-capita metrics is flawed because it shouldn't be getting tallied up for Iceland but distributed accordingly on baisis of its trading data. \n\nThe same way China's per capita pollution emissions need to reflect the fact that more Western people buy their shit.

aS'&gt;And yet the west approved of gay marriage before Japan, China, or Russia, despite their lack of evangelicalism.\n\nI don\'t know why you are lumping Russia with Japan and China. Russia last time I check is more western than either Japan or China. Furthermore, while China don\'t have gay marriage by law, they de-criminalized homosexuality itself in **1997**. Mean while, look how long it took for America to get the government out your bedroom (Especially under George W. Bush Administration)\n\n&gt;And all porn is illegal in China. Sexuality being taboo is more of a universal thing than a western puritan construct.\n\nPorn is regulated to a certain degree in all countries across the world. China made it illegal long time ago, just never had the political will/reason to undo it. \n\n&gt;You\'ll also have to tell me how recently American society rejected rock and roll as the devils music, because the rest of the world considers it to be an American invention.\n\nChristian right made a lot of things "demonic" all the time, Rock and Roll was indeed considered devil\'s music, so did Magic the Gathering, Dungeon and Dragons (GATE WAY TO SATANISM), and Harry Potter.

America wants to remain the world's largest economy and whatever China is doing is working to bring them up to level.\n\nBesides, how can you tell China to stop when you're still invading other countries for oil and fracking the earth's clean water supply?\n\n50 years ago, America did everything China was doing to the environment and they're still doing it now. Because of what they did, they have an enormous economy and are a global powerhouse. Just telling China to stop doing what they're doing and let America remain the global superpower isn't going to work. Just look at how hypocritical that sounds."

For instance, the Naxi ethnic group of Chinese people and all followers of the Dongba religion actually worship the environment and fight to preserve it, but you seem ignorant that such people even exist in China.  \n\nWhereas you look around and see people driving wasteful cars, I notice the massive amount of bicycles, electric scooters, and the incredibly efficient public transport system with a network of metros that one could only dream of ever having in a US city.   \n\nI could go on about how China pollutes less per capita than the US, or how they have the largest network of wind energy in the world, but maybe you should just read about these things yourself, since you live here and clearly haven't bothered to study the country much at all.

The US is really the only force in the world that can force the Chinese to sit down and discuss these issues without resorting to purely military means to settle them. \n\nThis isn't just about the Islands there isn't anything the US military could do short of starting WWIII to remove China's military presence from these islands. This is about future relations in the Asian region. Either China is going to use it's size and it's wealth to make countries submit to their will or they're going to work things out with their neighbors. While China might win today by getting the islands and the associated resources the world would lose. Because all that's going to do is lead to a military buildup across Asia and the tangling of alliances and Asia becoming a backdrop for Western + Asian Democracies versus China and their regional allies to stoke tension.

The last half of the war was China throwing hundreds of thousands of men at our forces, only for them to be turned to burned hamburger meat by heavy machine guns and napalm. \n\n&gt; and the Russian nuclear arsenal to worry about. You're not nearly as powerful as you think.\n\nNukes are an equalizer true, but the US is making great leaps in the field of missile defense. Also, remember that period where the US was the only country with the bomb? Yeah. In 1945 the US was literally the single most dominant power in the entire history of the human species. By the end of the war we were not only outproducing the entire Axis combined in several areas, not only had the best equipped army on the planet, and an untouched homeland, we had a doomsday weapon all to ourselves to boot. \n\nThere were forces within the US military during that period (General Patton being the most famous) who didn't want to stop at Berlin. They wanted to keep going all the way to Moscow and break the USSR right then and there.\n\nWe could have done it. We could easily have done it. But we didn't, and arguably the world is a better place because of that decision. The Cold War sucked in a lot of ways, but it was definitely a boon to human progress. I doubt humanity would be where it is today if the US had established an utterly unchallenged global hegemony back then."

Now, maritime disputes are another thing due to the strategic location of the SCS and Diaoyutai/Senkaku, but I'm pretty sure none of the military outposts by the aforementioned countries have eliminated the possibility of diplomacy. In fact, the ASEAN refusal to outright condemn China's actions is proof that the various nations within ASEAN have differences in opinion about this.\n\n&gt;*The US is really the only force in the world that can force the Chinese to sit down and discuss these issues without resorting to purely military means to settle them.*\n\nThe US was not involved in any way regarding the 17 of 23 territorial disputes China has settled with its neighbours (Russia and the -stans). Of the two remaining land disputes with India and Bhutan, one might argue the Indian assumption of US military support is a factor in why the disputes are still unsettled.\n\nJudging by China's past history, they are far more likely to work with their neighbours than to outright subjugate them (see: China treating its neighbours as symbolically tributary states). Now, you can point me to many historical exceptions to this rule in China's 2000+ year history but that's how the civilization state behaved in general.\n\n&gt;*Because all that's going to do is lead to a military buildup across Asia and the tangling of alliances and Asia becoming a backdrop for Western + Asian Democracies versus China and their regional allies to stoke tension.*\n\nIsn't this already happening regardless with the Asian Pivot?

aS'&gt; US made the choices it did to ensure their own way of dominating the world and it came at an expense of a rise of some formidable foes who want their own piece of the cake. If US turns to war now to ensure this dominance, I think they\'ll get slapped right back to the point where any sort of plausible victory is hardly a victory at all.\n\nAfter World War II the US made the logical decision that no other super power has ever made when put into a similar situation. We decided against expanding our power through conquest and land grabbing. In fact, we actually lost land. We gave the Philippines their independence. Instead of going empire mode, the US established dominance and influence through power projection. The US isn\'t only the most powerful country in history, NATO is the most powerful alliance in history as well, and that doesn\'t even include several of our other firm allies like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, or the Philippines.\n\nOur alliances give us the opportunity to have military bases in countries across the entire planet without having to fight to hold a frontier like the empires of old did. Our aircraft carriers provide a similar role as well. And because of how advanced our military is, we can be anywhere almost immediately.\n\nThe world lives in Pax Americana right now, and while China might seem like an up and comer, they are **FAR** from actually being anywhere near out level. Our military tech is years ahead of theirs in many areas (which is why they try to steal so much of it) and their carrier "fleet" is made up of a still not fully operational former Soviet tub they have retrofitted. Not to mention their strongest alliance is with North Korea.\n\nEveryone else in Asia is either weary of China, or outright dislikes them. The US may meddle a lot today, but China has "meddled" in Southeast Asia for well over 2000 years. They have always been a geopolitical octopus in that part of the world. Vietnam actually has a better opinion of the US than of China for this reason. If a major conflict ever broke out in Asia and pitted the US against China, China would find itself almost completely alone.'

aS'Erdogan is an authoritarian islamist \n\n&gt;Throughout his leadership, beginning with his election to prime minister in 2003, Erdogan has restructured the formerly-secular education system overseeing the growth of imam hatip, or religious training schools, throughout the country. According to the Financial Times, such schools boasted 63,000 students in 2002-2003; by 2014, the number of imam hatip students had exploded to 983,000.\n\n&gt;What makes this particularly disturbing is the fact that tens, if not hundreds of thousands of these students never signed up for imam hatips to begin with. Rather, Erdogan systematically reshaped existing secular public schools and redesigned the student examination system so that thousands of children are assigned to imam hatips even against their will.\n\n&gt;But he hasn\'t stopped there. As of a year ago, all public schools also provide mandatory "religious culture and ethics" courses beginning at age nine. Yet despite a 2007 European Court of Human Rights ruling requiring education in all religions, human rights lawyer and columnist Orhan Kemal Cengiz writes in Al-Monitor, "Sunni Islam continues to be imposed, with students required to memorize Islamic prayers and Quranic verses."\n\n[source](http://www.investigativeproject.org/4717/guest-column-erdogan-grooms-a-new-jihad-generation#)\n\n&gt;He has sought to reverse the ban on head scarves in state institutions, called for a "change of mindset" in the judiciary,[5] embraced Hamas, and endorsed an Al-Qaeda financier.[6] He has sought to equate religious school education with that of secular schools,[7] and his political party has worked to enforce Islamic alcohol bans in some municipalities \n\n[source](http://www.meforum.org/1672/does-prime-minister-erdogan-accept-turkish-secularism)\n\n&gt;He has purged the army of its secular officers through primitive show trials and brutally repressed freedom of speech.\n\n&gt;Today, there are more imprisoned journalists in Turkey than in Communist China and perhaps any other country in the world.\n\n[source](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Candidly-Speaking-Turkeys-Erdogan-An-autocratic-Islamist-bigot-330005)\n\n&gt;"You cannot put women and men on an equal footing," he told a meeting in Istanbul.

We try to muffle the sound but they don't do that in China. \n\nThere's also no cultural taboo here about just letting your kid piss wherever he or she wants to. No thought whatsoever to your surroundings. Chinese kids don't wear diapers so instead they have these pants with no crotch in them. Now, if we were just talking about pissing near a tree or something , meh. Unfortunately, the older generation (who very often are the ones raising the kids) just tell the kid to piss or shit wherever he or she is standing. One time I walking into my building and some old lady was telling her kid to piss right in front of the elevator. I asked her if she would mind if I went and pissed in front of her door. Naturally I have no doubt that she was pissed off at me, some foreigner, telling her to prove she's at least a little civilized but she didn't say anything. I've seen grandmothers here telling kids to take a piss right in the middle of a department store on the floor. I was pleasantly surprised to see a clerk go over and tell her to grow a brain and realize that there are bathrooms she can use. Again, however, it was the older generation doing this.

aS'Upvote this post. The notes abotu Mao, the CR, the GLF, and the political ripples that happened in the wake of all that are **extremely** important in understanding current (as compared to ancient) Chinese social behavior. \n\n\n&gt;Domestic commerce also was stimulated by the reform policies, which explicitly endeavored to enliven the economy by shifting the primary burden of the allocation of goods and services from the government plan to the market. **Private entrepreneurship and freemarket activities were legalized and encouraged in the 1980s, although the central authorities continuously had to fight the efforts of local government agencies to impose excessive taxes on independent merchants.** By 1987 the state-owned system of commercial agencies and retail outlets coexisted with a rapidly growing private and collectively owned system that competed with it vigorously, **providing a wider range of consumption choices for Chinese citizens than at any previous time.**\n\n&gt;Although the reform program achieved impressive successes, it also gave rise to several serious problems. One problem was the challenge to party authority presented by the principles of freemarket activity and professional managerial autonomy. **Another difficulty was a wave of crime, corruption, andin the minds of many older peoplemoral deterioration caused by the looser economic and political climate. The most fundamental tensions were those created by the widening income disparities between the people who were "getting rich" and those who were not and by the pervasive threat of inflation.** These concerns played a role in the political struggle that culminated in party general secretary Hu Yaobang\'s forced resignation in 1987. Following Hu\'s resignation, the leadership engaged in an intense debate over the future course of the reforms and how to balance the need for efficiency and market incentives with the need for government guidance and control. The commitment to further reform was affirmed, but its pace, and the emphasis to be placed on macroeconomic and microeconomic levers, remained objects of caution.\n\n[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)) source for quote\n\nSo after a culling of the elite classes, a promotion of the "working man," decades of want and stagnant growth, suddenly then the opportunity to make quick cash with foreign investments, a focus on exports joined with a concurrent trend to move cheap jobs to China gives a swathe of people new buying power and choices and they **AREN\'T** supposed to act like yahoos? It might be asking a lot.

aS'History and communism, probably.\n\nIn the late 1800s, California in particular started freaking out about Chinese immigrants, because they had a strong work ethic and did everything, no matter the job or the conditions.  They started being looked at as competition among the working class, and so what\'s now called "Yellow Panic" set in.  The Chinese were discriminated against, and eventually the US moved to restrict immigration.  Chinese immigrants were also barred from naturalization because they were deemed "unassimilatable".\n\nEventually the restrictions got overturned in 1947, but then communism rose to power in China in 1949, and by then, the Red Scare was just about poised to go into full swing along with the Cold War, so forget about accepting the Chinese then.  Even when the Cold War ended, America was still so "NO COMMUNISM BAD" from 40ish years of anti-Communist sentiment and the threat of nuclear war hanging over our heads that it was ingrained that you don\'t trust the commies.\n\nWhile we\'re still freaked out about communism (as evidenced by the people that start screeching about socialism everytime national healthcare comes up), China is now a major player on the world stage, and the US isn\'t too happy about the idea.  We\'re also really good at holding racial grudges; sadly, we\'ve had a lot of practice.\n\ntl;dr: America hates China becaus history/communism/OhMyGodTheyreAWorldPowerWTF.'

It was occupied for longer, but wasn\'t the same status as Korea.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule\n\n&gt;Korea under Japanese rule is the culmination of a process that began with the JapanKorea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Japanese Empire, first as a protectorate in 1905 (JapanKorea Treaty of 1905), and officially annexed in 1910 (JapanKorea Annexation Treaty).[6] Japan brought to a close the Joseon Dynasty and Korea officially became an integral part of Japan.\n\nTaiwan, however, was only ever treated as a colony.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule#Cession_of_Taiwan_.281895.29\n\n&gt;China ceded the islands of Taiwan and Penghu to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895. According to the terms of the treaty, Taiwan and Penghu (isles between 119E-120E and 13N-14N) were to be ceded to Japan in perpetuity. Both governments were to send representatives to Taiwan immediately after signing to begin the transition process, which was to be completed in no more than two months. Because Taiwan was ceded by treaty, the period that followed is referred to by some as the "colonial period", while others who focus on the fact that it was the culmination of a war refer to it as the "occupation period".\n\n&gt;Japan\'s approach to ruling Taiwan could be roughly divided into two views. The first, supported by Got, held that from a biological perspective, the natives could not be completely assimilated. Thus, Japan would have to follow the British approach, and Taiwan would never be governed exactly the same way as the Home Islands but would be governed under a whole new set of laws.'

aS"I've read opinions that their (Ottoman) control over trade to China was one of the reasons western european naval powers were so open to finding an oceanic route, which led to their discovery of the  New World.  And the discovery of the New World by the western naval powers in turn ultimately led to the decline of the Ottoman Empire by virtue of the difficulty of an already weaker Ottoman navy being unable to gain access to the new lands.\n\nThat said, I think this new Silk Road plan by China is going to have dramatic influence over geopolitics in the near future.  It's already causing issues along the LOC in Kashmir between Pakistan/India and China/India borders.  \n\nPakistan's economy, which has been steadily improving and creating one of the world's largest middle classes, should see further improvement to the economy, and with that, we should see a steep decline in fundamentalism along its Western border.  Conversely, i suspect India will step up efforts to force border issues with China and Pakistan, to make it more difficult for China to build their highway through Kashmir and to Kashgar.\n\nIt might also have a slight impact on India's economy, with China no longer necessitating the need to ship oil around India.  Pakistan has already taken steps towards this by expanding their Indian Ocean territory by around 250 square kilometers, making shipping by sea to India a little more troublesome and probably costly.  And if China can build up Gwadar like they are promising, then it could also spell trouble for the Gulf Oil nations, like the UAE and Qatar, which should manifest as more issues with Pakistan.\n\nI think these Gulf Oil/Pakistan issues are already evident with the most recent tension between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  Pakistan is asserting itself more against these states and will likely continue to do so in the future.\n\n\nThe whole thing could turn into a mess, but could improve the region as a whole in about a decade or so.  Or at least according to my understanding of the situation.  But it's very interesting nonetheless."

aS"True.  I just think that there should be a different model that doesn't rely on economic exploitation.  I'm actually fine with the political influence these types of loans cause (it's a natural, almost necessary by-product), but policies that force crops to be changed for export materials to donor countries only, or reduction in spending on health and education should be removed.\n\nIt's why I like the Silk Road investment by China in Pakistan.  It doesn't rely on direct loans to the country, but rather, on a loan to its own banks for the sake of development in other nations.  China gets a foothold in China and gains political influence but Pakistan benefits with better infrastructure and increased economic opportunities.  It leaves the real economic development in Pakistan up to itself ."

There is currently a push to setup refineries in other countries anyways, so I don't see that kind of thing in Afghanistan happening soon. \n\nThere where couple mines and refineries setup when China tried to game the market couple years back and that allowed for new sources of supply to be built, now they're struggling since China eased the export again. \n\nYou see there probably won't be much of an effect on China's monopoly.

Bringing in Sweden is smart too. Sweden plausibly had a Russian sub in its territorial waters. Sweden isn't a NATO power but has historically had cooperation with NATO. Also one thing Putin really fears is being surrounded by NATO powers. So inviting Sweden sends a message that if Putin tries something NATO will treat Sweden as a de facto member.\n\nIf we don't do this, then the next thing that could happen in Little Green Men in a city in one of the Baltic States. At that point there is a very high chance that either we will get war or the dissolution of NATO. Both of which are disastrous.\n\nThe US has a long experience of doing this with China over Taiwan. China has frequently said that it believes the US would 'choose Los Angeles over Taipei' - i.e. that if China invades the US would not be willing to fight a war in which LA would be a target to defend Taipei. The US has traditionally responded to this with a naval exercise near Taiwan. China interprets this as a sign that the US would intervene in a Chinese attempt to invade Taiwan and war has been averted.\n\nIncidentally in a sane world the US would not have to do this all over the place - some sort of international body would do it. Mind you so far we have never as a species been able to construct an international body which can do this sort of thing. There's a fundamental problem that either the international body has its own troops with sufficient fire power to impose its will, in which case it becomes a de facto world government or it is dependent on the troops of its members. In which case it will fail if those members decide not to action against an aggressor."

aS'Yes, it\'s a stupid reply. I\'ll tell you why.\n\nEvery country that does something "good" that is popular among its citizens, boasts about it a bit. This is human nature. Specially if it has a free press to do the boasting, that is looking for cheap publicity to boost its ratings.\n\nA couple days ago there was a picture posted here about a US aircraft loaded with about 50 rescue workers and 3-4 tons of supplies for Nepal. It was the first aid the US sent to Nepal, and the *only* aid so far, and it arrived in Nepal many days after the earthquake, last Monday.\n\nI don\'t know if you saw this post, but it had about 6000 upvotes, made front page. It was full of Americans saying stuff like "fuck yeah, Americans to the rescue, now we\'ll show the world what rescue means. We\'ve got the best technology and the best aid and we\'re the most generous country in the world, how lucky for Nepal that we\'re helping!"\n\nThere were literally thousands of comments saying this sort of stuff. Consider that the American aid package is much smaller than that of India or China. Consider that they\'re sending it many days after the earthquake, when you\'re basically digging corpses out of the rubble, nobody buried is still alive.\n\nThis is boasting, and **every country does it**. It isn\'t meant for Nepal, it\'s for internal consumption by the country that does it. It\'s for their own population. The Chinese media has been full of stories about all the wonderful stuff China is doing for Nepal. If you read them, you may come away with the impression that only China is helping Nepal, nobody else is doing anything.\n\nAll of this has nothing to do with Nepal. It\'s about selling your government\'s actions to your own public. This is politics, and every country does it. There is no point getting upset over things like this.\n\n&gt;Do you know the news, a 4 months old baby was saved after 22 hours in the rubble? According to India, its the work of Indian Army. I was in that area at that time and I am damn sure, it was Nepali army who did all the work. \n\nLike I said, it isn\'t "according to India". You are wrong. It\'s "according to Indian media". Indian media is not India. There is plenty of criticism towards Indian media *inside India*, with people saying they are stupid and sensationalistic. If you go to /r/India on Reddit, you will see many posts by Indians criticizing Indian media over the Nepal stories. And you will see dozens of stories of Americans criticizing American media. It happens everywhere that a free press exists. The only place where it *doesn\'t* happen is in countries like China, because if you are too critical of official media, you will probably go to jail.\n\nThere is no need to be offended with such things. Just understand that in democracies, people say a lot of things, and some of them are stupid. You shouldn\'t blame a country of a billion people because of what some stupid people say.\n\n&gt;Do you know a little place called THAMEL in Nepal? Its a tourist area. Just because Indians happen to visit there, go to pub and club there, it became a LITTLE INDIA???\n\nDo you know Chicago in the US, where I live? There is a whole neighborhood up north near Devon street, called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know New York City? In Manhattan, near Rose Hill, it\'s called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know Berkeley in California? The area near University Avenue is called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know Edison in New Jersey? It\'s called LITTLE INDIA. Plus half a dozen other states in the US.\n\nAnd not just the US. Do you know Gerrard Bazaar in Toronto in Canada? It\'s called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know Rexdale? It\'s called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know LITTLE INDIA in Vancouver, Canada? Or Mill Woods in Edmonton, Canada? Or Taradale in Calgary, Canada? All have LITTLE INDIA.\n\nBut do you know they also have LITTLE CHINA and CHINATOWN? Or they have LITTLE VIETNAM? Or they have LITTLE KOREA? And half a dozen other countries?\n\nThese are just popular tourist designations for ethnic places. Nobody here gets upset about these names, people **love these names**. It makes them feel that their city has a truly cosmopolitan flavor. You are getting offended over nothing.\n\n&gt;Indian helicopters and planes held Nepal airport so that Chinese fund and aid would not land. They are literally playing politics.\n\nThat is fucking lies and bullshit. Nepal has **only one** airport capable of landing large aircraft, and that is Tribhuvan in Kathmandu. And that single airport has **only one** runway long enough to land them. It has **no instrument landing system**, every plane must be landed via tower guidance, and it\'s slow.\n\nThis **single long runway in the whole country of Nepal** was damaged in the earthquake so it was no longer usable. It was repaired by Indians, and it has been in use **constantly** since then. The number of flights to Nepal used to be very very small before the earthquake. Now suddenly this single runway is in extreme demand, as dozens of countries try to land planes there. **Of course there will be a traffic jam**. It\'s like trying to push 50,000 cars through one narrow street.\n\nIndians are getting blamed because they are running the airport. If Nepalese ran it, then Nepalese would be getting blamed. Or if the Chinese ran it, they would get blamed. Because one fucking runway in a whole country isn\'t enough to land all the emergency flights and take off again.\n\nIndia isn\'t keeping Chinese aid out. Two days ago, a Malaysian plane carrying aid was turned back because the airport was too busy. It had to circle the airport for **8 hours** and it had to return to Kolkota twice to refuel before it could land in Nepal. But the Malaysians didn\'t complain, nor did they blame the Indians, because they **fucking know** the logistics of trying to land hundreds of airplanes on one single runway.\n\nYou sound like a nationalistic idiot. Your comments are full of "national pride" and stupidity.\n\nLet me tell you what the situation looks like to an outsider. Nepal produces **nothing**. Nepal trades next to nothing. Nepal relies on tourism, and extorts money from its neighbors by playing them against each other. It tells India "give me money or I\'ll be closer with your enemy China". It tells China "give me money or I\'ll go closer to your enemy India". \n\nNobody likes these threats, nobody likes paying on threats. It\'s no different from Pakistan periodically saying "give me money or we will export more terrorists". Or North Korea saying "give me money or we\'ll produce more nuclear weapons". Nepal is a gentler form of blackmail, but it\'s still fucking blackmail.\n\nIf I were the Indian government, I would just say "fuck you, go to China if you want". See how the Chinese treat you. They took over your neighbor Tibet, and now Han Chinese are settling in Tibet, treating the Tibetans like dogs and servants, taking over their land and turning them into homeless bums. Every few days, a Tibetan monk or nun commits suicide by burning himself or herself to death. That\'s how the Tibetans feel about the Chinese, but there\'s nothing else they can do than to burn themselves in protest.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, has treated Nepal very well. It doesn\'t treat Nepalese as cattle, because they are the **same fucking people** - same culture, same religion, same language too for many Nepalese though not all. But all I ever hear from Nepalese is how nasty the Indians are.\n\nSo fuck them, I say. What\'s the worst that can happen? Nepal will become another state of China? So what? It\'s not like Nepal is rich and will make China even richer. It won\'t offer China any huge advantage that China doesn\'t already have. The worst it can do is bring the Chinese border closer to India, but India already shares a huge border with China in the east, so what\'s a few hundred kilometers more? It\'s not like China could invade and conquer India, a county of 1.3 billion people with nuclear weapons.\n\nAll that will happen is that the India-Nepal border, which is visa free and open to both sides will suddenly shut down and become the largest armed camp in the world, on both sides. With Chinese weapons trained on India, and Indian weapons trained on Chinese Nepal. I doubt this will help the people of Nepal, they will just be burning themselves like the Tibetans do today, to protest Chinese treatment.'

aS"&gt;Most likely, They're just changing their trades and now doing a lot more trading with China and India.\n\nExactly the case. It's a temporary problem that can be fixed with closer (geographically and politically) allies. Something already exists, the BRIC bank, that they can hopefully take advantage of. If Russia doesn't buckle from political/economic circumstances, give it a decade and the BRIC bank will be moving smoothly. That's Russias IDEAL end-game, considering China's massive economy and Indias developing economy. Bad news though, is China is potentially close to popping and is still suffering from the 2007-2008 global recession. \n\n&gt;It'll be harder and longer for them to get the monetary power they had back however.\n\nIt'll be harder for them to gain monetary power directly, but if they begin using the BRIC bank and it works, that provides more stability. They're one of the primary decision makers in the BRIC bank and there's a huge demand in Eur-Asia for an alternative system that the West doesn't profit on. \n\nThe power Russia lost is hurting them extremely hard in the short-term. But the power the West loses if they lose the ability to skim off the top of ALL Asian transactions and the ability to bully with sanctions is far greater of a threat to the West in the long-term. \n\n[I'm really interesting in seeing 10+ years out if Iran is allowed/willing to participate in the BRIC.](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iran-sanctions-brics-oil-tehran-nuclear-programme-513640) That could be a GAME CHANGER in the Middle/Near East.\n\nI think it's an extremely risky move by the West to alienate Russia with a relatively small guaranteed strategic advantage (Ukraine ties and a potential domino effect in other former Soviet states). If it DOES pay off, Russia essentially falls, though. "

aS'&gt;That\'s one (very comical) way to look Iran having sanctions imposed on it for the last 45 years. That\'s why they are trying so hard to get the sanctions lifted right now I suppose? Because they are so much better off with the sanctions in place.\n\nJust because you put words into my mouth and act as if that\'s what I said doesn\'t mean that I don\'t agree with you. Tell me where I suggested that Iran was "better off" or that they weren\'t trying to "end the sanctions." \n\nThose in power have nuclear weapons or are close economic allies of people with nuclear weapons. Iran is extremely close to being capable of getting nuclear weapons and those in power do not want Iran to have nuclear weapons. The easiest way to prevent it is to cut off their financial funding. Those in power will do anything to protect the advantage they have. And Iran having nuclear weapons may force Iran into the world picture. \n\nIran already does trade with China and AIIB countries. It\'ll only be a matter of time before the East has a strong enough network to make Iran\'s sanctions not mean as much. That kind of already happened in the past 10 years. Of course they don\'t *want* the sanctions. It cuts out the world\'s largest importer and the entire EU. But at the end of the day, they have resources for sale that other countries need. They may not get top dollar for it, but they\'re getting close. \n\nA lot of it comes down to making a point and statement with Iran. They know they\'d have little chance of winning a war with Israel and the world powers. But, make an example out of North Korea and Iran and other countries will be scared to piss the West off. \n\n&gt;Check Russias GDP their not winning any wars. They have fallen behind India already, down to 10th place in the world, In fact, Russia is the smallest of the big four in BRIC. Russia is a Non-Player-Character in the war of world wide finance.\n\nI once again don\'t know what post you read, but it certainly wasn\'t mine. "The easiest war you can wage is a financial war." Who is waging the war? Not Russia. The US. Read my other post about 2 inches down on your screen. I did anything but paste a rosy picture of Russia ATM. \n\n&gt;If Russia doesn\'t buckle from political/economic circumstances, give it a decade and the BRIC bank will be moving smoothly. \n\n&gt;The power Russia lost is hurting them extremely hard in the short-term.\n\n&gt;If it DOES pay off, Russia essentially falls, though.\n\nOn to the next. \n\n&gt;Check Russias GDP their not winning any wars. They have fallen behind India already, down to 10th place in the world, In fact, Russia is the smallest of the big four in BRIC.\n\n[True, but extremely misleading.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:RUS:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:RUS:GBR:CAN:CHN:USA:IND&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) Russia had experienced 4x GDP growth in 15 years with no signs of stopping - very similar to the US in the same time period. Prior to the sanctions/Ukrainian war [(You can check here)](http://knoema.com/nwnfkne/world-gdp-ranking-2015-data-and-charts), they were just BARELY surpassed by India. Sure it\'s a couple years of poor GDP, but that certainly hasn\'t impacted their *capability.* Here\'s the problem comparing Apples (Russia) to oranges (China/India). [For one, Russia is ALREADY FAIRLY INDUSTRIALIZED. AND Russia pretty much leads the non-Western world in GDP per capita.](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg). Russia-China trade is currently [booming,](http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2014/12/24/china-russia-trade-boom-2015.html) which is a positive sign of economic health. Meanwhile, China and India are still in the process of industrializing. Why is this relevant? It\'s used to calculate GDP. All new infrastructure is added to GPD. China\'s GDP is high because they\'re building this infrastructure - BUT RUSSIA ALREADY HAS IT! GDP from industrialization isn\'t sustainable - there\'s only so much you can build. To be fair, Russia\'s infrastructure lags far behind, has depreciated, but so does the US\'s (to a lesser extent). Regardless, you\'re comparing Russia to two very different economies in different stages of development. [The other huge factor is birth rate.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA:CHN:IND&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false). Russia has only recently picked up following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, China and India are prospering from DECADES of insane fucking. Moral of the story? Fuck a lot in a pre-industrialized country and your economy will grow. It should be interesting to see the difference in India vs. China in the coming years, because China put a stop to the intense fucking while India is still reproducing like rabbits. [India, the US, and China are flooded with 20-40 year old workers ATM.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Median_age.png/1280px-Median_age.png). Russia is aging like Europe. With low reproductive rates, that\'s significant negative points for Russia. BUT, don\'t ignore this fact either... "According to a 2008 World Bank statistic 54% of the Russian labor force has attained a tertiary (college) education, giving Russia the highest attainment of college-level education in the world." The US trails by almost 15%.\n\nOutlook wise? [In 2013, Russia was doing far better than India/Brazil when it comes to foreign investment.](http://www.ey.com/RU/En/Issues/Business-environment/EY-road-to-2030-russian-infrastructure-in-global-context) The sanctions change that, for obvious reasons, but the demand is still there. They only trail China by 12%. \n\n&gt;Russia doesn\'t even have enough financial reserves left to pay off the Fascist midgets criminal co-conspirators who are loosing their shirts right now.\n\nI don\'t disagree with that statement either. Putin has a hard fight, currently. Some of the oligarchs are loyalists, others are just businessmen. At the end of the day, there are plenty of trained marksman for sale and a leader with a target on his head who is the enemy of some of the richest, craziest motherfuckers in the world. Though I don\'t really see that happening either. \n\nUnless another round of sanctions hit it looks like the ruble is recovering. It\'ll probably only recover 50-60% of the lost value, but that\'s already foregone. Businessmen know this. Businessmen also happen to know that civil wars, assassinations, and major policy changes will hurt Russian morale. \n\nPeople underestimate Russia\'s capability because for the last 25 years they\'ve been recovering from the collapse of an empire aka glasnost. The US prospered following WW2 because they didn\'t claim land - they focused on Japan and Germany. Russia spread themselves too thin and tried to form too big of an empire quickly. But, underestimating your "enemy" is a huge, huge oversight. They still are an industrial machine. They\'re still the most matched and most willing military enemy of the US. Their military is fairly state of the art in that "If Russia goes to war, the US might have slightly better tech, but not enough to dominate," ignoring the nuke thing. [And if you doubt Russia\'s efficiency and competence, check out the Sukhoi T-50.](http://www.wired.com/2012/11/russia-stealth/) It\'s very comparable to the 1.5T F-22 at a cost of only 10B (Though that will surely go up with production and modifications). I\'d say they beat us there. Though, they do lag ~5-8 years behind the US so we\'d definitely have the edge - but I don\'t think anyone questions that. \n\n**TLDR; Hate Russia all you want, but their GDP per capita is the highest outside the Western World, their GDP grew at a similar rate to the US prior to sanctions, they have a decent - but aging - infrastructure, the ruble\'s freefall ended and is recovering, they\'re the most educated country in the world (by degree attainment), they\'re STILL recovering from glasnost, and their military tech is JUST BEHIND the US\'s at a much cheaper cost.** \n\nSorry if there are typos and bad transitions. It\'s 5AM here and I don\'t want to proof-read. Edit: also had to take a shit. \n\nEdit: also that completely looked at the good side of Russia in this comment. I could write a pretty long comment on the downsides too - such as worker productivity growth which is [shit in Russia](https://thereformedbroker.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/chopsticks.gif). '

aS"Indeed, if you look at the history of countries that have rapidly modernized, liberalism and democracy are largely irrelevant to whether they can effectively do so. China became rich without being a democracy. So did South Korea (under Park Chung Hee) and Singapore (under Lee Kuan Yew) and Taiwan (under the KMT). The vast majority of people couldn't vote back when when Britain modernized or when Japan modernized.\n\nThe success of a country is most closely correlated with the effectiveness and efficiency of its institutions and the reasonableness and dedication of the people managing them, regardless of how those institutions are justified. Lee Kuan Yew's authoritarianism worked, but Putin's and Mugabe's didn't. American liberal democracy worked, but South Africa's arguably wasn't as successful."

Look at what happened to people like Snowden and movements like OWS.\n\nOh... and funny that you mentioned the protests in Hong Kong. A perfect example of more tolerance and less violence used by China to deal with them than the US authorities used on OWS protesters. There was way less escalation of violence in Hong Kong and very few arrests. There was only *one* major outbreak of violence during the Hong Kong protests and that was as a consequence of thousands of people blocking access to an important government building and the police removing people from that specific area by force. (You know... the equivalent of surrounding the White House, smashing windows, and preventing politicians from entering or leaving. What do you believe would happen to Americans trying to put Obama under house arrest?)\n\n&gt; they were silenced and intimidated\n\nThey really weren't. The protests died pretty naturally. In fact, there are still remaining groups protesting but the majority of the population heard the debate, the arguments, and decided to wait for actual results instead of blindly opposing China based on nothing but propaganda.   \n\nYou know... unlike in the US, where there was a massive anti-OWS propaganda campaign and protests were violently broken up by police.\n\n&gt;and while free speech in the U.S. isn't a perfect concept\n\nIt is a completely meaningless concept because speech literally isn't free in the US. To be heard in the US, you need lots of money.\n\n&gt; I feel a lot more free to criticize my own government right now than criticize China's government when I went there\n\nOf course, that's because you were indoctrinated by your government and media to feel that way. You were raised since childhood to fear China and communism. You are an American.\n\nIn the meantime, there are far more protests in China than there are in the US. Far more people speaking out against the government. Far more diverse political opinions. Of course, as an American you never hear about that. Why? Because you don't hear any voice but that of your corporations and your government. Because they are the only ones with enough money and power to scream their messages loud enough.\n\nEdit: Downvoting and desperately censoring the truth won't make it any less reality, my US apologetic friends. Just look at the kind of people arguing against me. No arguments, ridiculous levels of ignorance and misinformation, nothing but personal attacks. Some desperate attempts to attack China while ignoring the fact that the US is plain and simply worse. That's the reality, Americans. I know it's hard to accept but your denial is truly pitiful."

But in the end, nationalist troops(including the warlords not directly under KMT) contributed around 1 million of Japanese casualties were as Communist contributed around 400 thousand Japanese and 1 million Chinese troops under japanese puppet regime, effectly scoring a 2:1 against the Communists.

China is far from free. Did you seriously just say Tibet is a minority? They're a country that was invaded and destroyed and held down constantly. Let's talk about Taiwan. Basically the only part of China that is free. China is holding a huge gun to Taiwan's head. The only reason they haven't pulled the trigger is because we would nuke the shit out of China if they tried it. You really don't know anything about China or international politics.

China claims historical ownership of the region as many of the states that have existed within it were tributary to Imperial China. However, Chinese power had essentially been absent for generations preceding the Qing reconquest in the late 19th century. There have also been two independant East Turkestani states within Xinjiang since that time. As with Tibet, China's presence in Xinjiang (at least until the large influx of Han over the past 50 years) was largely just about the opportunity to expand and to build a buffer between the heartlands and Central Asia."

aS'as that account was just banned just now from /r/worldnews(ROFL that was quick) so I will answer on this one:   \n   \nI would prefer to live in the country that provides more real gains for its people, despite the corruption. Corruption is nothing new, it has existed for millenniums, in every facet of government and society. The US, nor China, is not exempt from that inevitable truth. What China has done, however, in recent years, is turn that corruption(the existence of an authoritarian "illegitimate" government) into real $ for its people. Even if the $ is not distributed evenly, it has lifted its people from crappy mud housing into skyscrapers with running water/energy, and turned the country from a 3rd world shit pile into the next potential super power. And the reason for this is precisely b/c of the difference b/w the 2 country\'s corrupt governments. The Chinese government gains its legitimacy through its ***results***, as without them the people will rise in opposition. The US government gains its legitimacy through its ***process***, and it acts like safety valve to express dissent, without any actual real progress being made.'

No, read the [article](http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-china-forces-shot-protesters-xinjiang-residents-2015-4), it clearly says 96 is the total number of casualties from terrorists attacking civilians and the police response afterwards.

You can immigrate.  If you love the idea of living in an Orwellian dystopia that ignores human rights, individuality and basic freedoms like democracy, you're more than welcome to go move to China.\n\n&gt;Humans rights and individuality get put to the side in the interests of progress for the collective. We can't have an Earth full of people like Americans or Westerners, that's a very quick path to extinction. Individualism has to shrink, has to stop, I think certain liberties and freedoms should be curtailed in the best interest of all humans. \n\n There's no reason to justify such a silly claim.  Historically, you don't see as many wars involving one democratic nation versus another democratic nation.  There's usually at least one authoritarian government involved.  That ought to be your first clue that more democracy is what's needed for humans to avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nChina isn't a model of progress.  It's just profitable.  That's not the same thing.  You don't see China leading the way in space exploration or invention of new technologies.  Those tend to be developed in nations which value freedom, creativity, and individuality.\n\n&gt; No government is perfect or even good, but China's government seems highly effective.\n\nThey had cheap labor.  Now that their economy has improved, their labor isn't as cheap anymore and their growth is slowing.  That's not a testament to being effective, but rather, having having tons of room to improve because you started off so poorly."

aS"China doesn't invade other countries because it has plenty going on in it's own. Like this. They merely cross several time zones in their own country to oppress Muslims rather than invade another country. The invasion and occupation was initially accomplished by the predecessors of this government. Generally, the marginal areas of China didn't exactly ask to be part of China, what with not identifying with it in any way and being generally, completely culturally and ethnically non Chinese. But China wanted territory, damn it, so now they are part of China. And China badly wants to displace or assimilate them as second class citizens, subject to Han Chinese officials and settlers, or failing any serious desire for settlement, at least assimilated, but ultimately answerable to some Han Chinese official or the other, and expected to abandon any native culture or allegience. You don't get a good post without being very pro Chinese and aping Chinese culture/bureaucratic culture.\n\n"

Legal definition of corruption general definition of corruption.  And if you want to expand the legal definition of corruption, the solution is to vote in favor of Campaign Finance Reform, not advocating authoritarianism.\n\nAnd for all of America's lobbyist/corruption issues, it's still less corrupt than China.  So advocating for China here is pretty silly.\n\n&gt; I don't know how China does it, but I much prefer a system of corruption that comes from a good place and within. The government controlling most businesses scares me a hell of a lot less than the thought of capitalists controlling everything, especialyl when they control the government.\n\nYou don't have to choose between Corporatocracy and Authoritarianism.

aS"well historically speaking a lot of empires have risen and fallen in Asia, but China, as well as a few other countries, remains from those times. Crusader states were perpetually at war, and Rome was always looking for next victim to conquer. The first did nothing but attack its neighbors relentlessly, while the second had an absolute desire to dominate and subjugate other peoples. I would say there's no question there. The Mongols under Ghenghis Khan swept across Asia and Eastern Europe, and Macedon under Alexander conquered its way all the way to India, and their successor states were constantly warring and bickering amongst themselves. Carthage I would actually consider about the same. Greece I lumped in with Macedon since Alexander sort of represents both. Greece is actually a weird case of a country historically speaking because it wasn't always a single country, especially in the ancient times which is the period that so many people find so interesting and captivating. China is somewhat similar in that respect, but you could say that for the a big portion of history, Chinese people were more interested with fighting each other than with anyone else. I would say that it's hard to gauge, as you say, but in Asia at least, China hasn't historically been the most aggressive empire. That would go to the Khitan, Xiongnu, Mongolians, and other steppe tribes. China has just lasted a long time and has slowly absorbed a lot of territory. It's rarely had leaders like Alexander or the Roman Senate, which are the kind that actively look to conquer other places and set up shop, then move on to the next place and then the next."

aS'China was also just "defending an ally"; except that the US force were fighting right next to the Chinese border and China had a legitimate concern for its own national security. Additionally, the United States have sent war ships to the Taiwan straight that militarily threatened the Chinese before the Chinese joined the Korean war. US war planes were also flying across the Chinese border. All these factors combined with the fact that North Korea were a communist ally to the Chinese, as well as the political pressure from the Soviets let to the Chinese intervention. \n\nSouth Korea have barely been established at that point and it was only by agreement with the Russians. Both North and South Korea had some legitimate claims to be the official government of Korea. The US intervened because it was afraid another country will fall to communism, especially since the Communists led by Mao were victorious after the Chinese civil war. It wasn\'t really the case that South Korea were US\'s allies by any means, it was a political war and part of the continuous trend US intervention when came to communism.  \n\nAdditionally, the US attempted to undermine the Chinese government on an international scale right before the start of the war by refusing to allow representatives from The Chinese Communist Party from representing China. The US insisted that the Taiwanese Government were the legitimate government of China even though they had no control over any aspect of China. \n\ntl;dr Pretty much, the US played a game of "I am not touching you!" with the Chinese and the Chinese fought back.'

Some of the industry plans under Mao were disastrous and actually resulted in contractions. \n\nEven ignoring economic development, China has done a better of providing access to healthcare as well, as evidenced by higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality rates, etc. Things like school and clinics for rural areas were part of concerted government programs to increase access for the poor, so returning to the original point, I guess, if China is allegedly so corrupt and their government so callous, what do you call India's government that has been doing worse by just about every metric?

You may have not noticed it much, but China has been building bases and presence in all major Asian countries, while US has been engaged in bloody wars that it can never win. Look at the Asian Infrastructure Bank and other institutes where China is getting a seat at the head of the table.

They asked for a resoluion in UN but owing to US influence, India was turned down. Nixon and Kissinger were willing to ignore the genocide and reinforce Pakistan if India were to attack.\n\n\nSo, US and UK moved their Navy in the Indian ocean going to attack India from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal but Soviet submarines came at the right time from Vladivostok. US decided its not worth it to start a fullscale world war over this and everyone went back. The Russians came because India had figured a possible pincer attack from US, Pak and China and so Indira Gandhi had signed a defensive pact with the Soviets if one of them were to attack. With the major powers out, India executed a very swift and short war before the UN could intervene, and helped Bangladesh become independant.

I am very conciously aware of how unhealthy I was and am due to my lifestyle. This whole thread is indicative of the misinformation regarding diet, exercise and health. People think that body fat is the end all be all of health. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s something to consider, but it\'s also important to locate where the fat actually is on the body. And when I work with patients, I don\'t care if they\'re not losing weight (it\'d be nice if they did) but all of them are OBSESSED with that number. Im more concerned with do you have a wider range of motion, can you walk further or faster than you could last week, is your resting heart rate, blood pressure, etc lower than before. Thats important information that many ignore. People constantly confuse fitness for health. And you end up with them saying things like "yea you can eat fast food or drink soda *in moderation* ". That isn\'t really true, even in moderation that stuff harms your body.

Those are also the only times they have launched an invasion in the past century. This is a nation that was subjugated by a foreign power for centuries, then utterly violated by Japan in WW2. Other than the two invasions(part of a defensive strategy), their military actions have amounted to stepping on some toes to make space for themselves. A nation of 320 million can have a global presence, but a nation of 1.3 billion cannot exert influence outside of its borders? That's just not how the world works, at least not for long. If they were as aggressive as you say they would've overrun Asia by now and there would be exponentially more violence and chaos in the world. Instead there is just the violence and chaos that can be primarily attributed to the West. Western Europe and the United States made Africa and the Middle East into the clusterfucks that they are. China invaded Korea and Cambodia to maintain buffer zones and fend off both superpowers who were either directly arming and funding invasions(USSR and Vietnam invading Cambodia), or carrying them out(USA in Korea).\n\n\n\nThey've managed to stick together through long periods of instability, and now their government works to maintain domestic stability and peacefully rise. They have 1.3 billion people, and 800,000,000 workers. It is SO easy to dissolve into civil war and constant unrest with a population that large. The government has to work for the people, or it will be opposed and overthrown, or China will be fractured. They have more workers than Europe has people(742 million). It takes a massive amount of organization and investment to organize something like that, so they've incorporated free market ideas. When that kind of labor force becomes organized and educated it should naturally rise to the top. We benefit as a species when such an enormous labor pool is kept healthy and fully utilized. They're pushing outward onto the seas because they need to. They have to ensure safe trade. The fact that nobody wants to openly fuck with them is a good sign for future security on the oceans. They don't have to fight to exert influence, the same way a 7 foot tall 300 pound man doesn't have to fight to prove physical dominance. \n\n\nThe issue with Taiwan shows Chinese restraint. They could squash Taiwan like a bug, and as opposing sides of a civil war that's probably what would've happened without Western interference. If the Republic of China(western-backed totalitarian government at the time) had defeated the communists in the mainland, you can bet the People's Republic of China leadership would have been eliminated. They'll most likely peacefully reunite in this century if China maintains its current progress, or China will back down on the issue because it's just not worth the trouble."

aS'You are a little wrong on a few things here. India only really started using the word "recognize" with regard to Tibet in 2003-- and has since backed away from clear acknowledgement with China\'s recent emphasis on Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin. India first started recognizing Chinese Tibet on the basis that changes in policy would be made (Tibet would "open up", and "One China" would be respected in exchange for Chinese respect of "One India"). These things did not happen, and in fact the Chinese have gotten more aggressive. Arunachal Pradesh isn\'t just a territory-- it\'s an entire Indian state, and the largest of the northeast states. Furthermore, the more recently volatile dispute isn\'t Arunachal Pradesh-- it\'s Aksai Chin, which is in Ladakh in the northwest Himalaya. The most recent military standoff here occurred in 2013, but the fact that small wars, skirmishes, and standoffs have occurred in these regions for around half a century is one that will constantly stand in the way of any genuinely friendly relations between the two countries. There is also a dispute concerning parts of Sikkim, and a region near Ladakh called the Trans-Karakoram Tract, and parts of the Indian ocean which are, somehow, now seeing the beginnings of serious Chinese claims.\n\nLastly, these conflicts have been bloodless only in recent times. but The Sino-Indian War and the following skirmishes cost thousands of lives. China has also shown support at different times for Pakistan and the Naxalites in their militant campaigns against India\'s government. You cannot be ignorant of these very real disputes-- there can be no progress in Indo-Chinese relations until they are settled. '

That is why they act differently from other Chinese - they were educated by the Japanese.\n\nThe same can be said for Koreans. They borrowed many things from the Japanese. Also, the Chinese are different from other Chinese because they've always been different from other Chinese. And I was comparing Korea and Taiwan, not Taiwan and China. Try to stay on topic.\n\n&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if given the chance at a referndum, Taiwanese would vote to become a part of Japan.\n\nWow... you're absolutely insane. Do you realize they are currently having a row over the Diayou/Senkaku islands? It's not just China and Japan, Taiwan is also claiming the islands (and China is supporting Taiwan's claim, and since they also claim Taiwan, it's all theirs). Of course, the islands have always been related to Taiwan, and even under Japanese occupation, the islands were part of Taiwan.\n\nAnyway, you're obviously quite crazy if you think the Taiwanese are going to up and vote to join Japan, so we're done here."

aS'You must be 15 if you think any of what you said is true.\n\nChina very much wants Pakistan and the US to continue to be friends.  This is because of inherent advantages China has regarding Pakistan as compared to the US.  The biggest one is that Pakistan will almost always need China to balance against India (and vice versa), whilst the US can switch sides based on whatever suits it.  Therefore, for China, Pakistan being "friendly" with rival powers isn\'t actually a problem, but a boon, because it can help strengthen Pakistan.\n\nAt the same time, the US is more worried about disinfecting the Islamist havens in Pakistan than a potential Chinese backdoor via Pakistan.  This is because the *costs* of trying to stop something that is beneficial to both countries is too high, and neither is it likely to succeed.  Not to mention it would also benefit the US because it could potentially solve the terrorist problem as well.  IE: there is really no major downside for the US to *not do anything about it*, but a lot of major downsides if they opposed it.\n\nNot to mention that Pakistan was instrumental for "introducing" the two to each other in the first place.  Pakistan has had close ties to both countries for most of its existence.'

aS'&gt;I don\'t know if it is the majority opinion, but a lot of the South Koreans don\'t want to pay the massive cost of rehabilitating the North as well as fear being flooded with the under-educated yokels up there.\n\nThe reunification issue in South Korea is heavily divided along generational lines. Older Koreans, especially those who lived through the Korean War and may have relatives yet living up north, are a lot more likely to want the two countries back together. Younger Koreans who have no sense of cultural or personal attachment to NK are a lot more circumspect. They\'re also right that they\'d likely be heavily taxed for the decades-long process of rebuilding and reunifying the two Koreas if the Kims ever croak, and that has definitely put a damper on the warm fuzzies.\n\nSouth Korea has a lot of difficulty integrating even the few thousand North Korean refugees it gets in an average year, and it\'s a small taste of the backbreaking work that integrating millions would be (no matter how slow or careful the process).\n\n&gt;Personally, I think the best bet is a one country-two systems policy.\n\nYep. This is something that a number of South Korean scholars who have studied the reunification issue have suggested themselves. Ideally North Korea would be turned into a sort of a U.N. protectorate for a few decades, but there\'s really no solution that\'s not going to be a political, economic, and diplomatic horror show.\n\n&gt;If the US troops (who have a massive presence there) went home, China wouldn\'t feel the need for the buffer state. \n\nThis is one of the most delicate and politically troublesome questions to sort through in the event that the two Koreas are on track to reunify:\n\n - **China** obviously doesn\'t want the bases there. This would actually be a decent bargaining chip if the U.S. ever wanted the Kims out and didn\'t care what it had to do in order to make this happen. Offering the Chinese a potential end to U.S. military presence in SK is a very powerful incentive to get them to end support for the Kims.\n - **The U.S.**, just as obviously, does want the bases there. It\'s a key part of the "pivot to Asia" that the U.S. military and diplomatic corps foresee in the 21st century.\n - **South Korea** is the $64,000 question; they could really go either way. I suspect its final decision would ultimately depend on what it sees of its relationship with China, which is its primary export market but has still unnerved a lot of East Asia by being so pushy about territorial claims. Chinese diplomats also created a lot of ill will with their South Korean counterparts during the Six-Party Talks. However, it would be politically easier for SK (both in relation to China and absorbing its northern cousin) to dump the bases, and younger South Koreans generally have more of a problem with them than their older cohorts. The U.S. has also handled various diplomatic issues related to them, most notably the Yangju highway incident, with its usual fuck-ups. I would also fully expect China to offer a very sweet deal of some kind to the South Koreans to get rid of the bases. However, having a U.S. base in your country is Cadillac-class insurance coverage against invasion, so ... who knows.\n - **Japan** definitely wants the bases there.\n - **Russia** would just as soon see the backside of the U.S. in East Asia, but is nervous about China\'s longterm ambitions. I suspect even Putin sees the U.S. base presence in SK as potentially useful for curbing Chinese overreach while not really having much of an impact on Russia.\n - **Other East Asian nations** will vary, but will probably trend toward wanting to keep the bases if things continue the way they\'ve been going lately. China has border disputes with all of its neighbors barring Russia at present, and hasn\'t made any friends over the various South China Sea issue. If SK does close the bases, or even some of them, the possibility of the U.S. getting another base elsewhere is the wild card.\n\nI suspect the usual diplomatic muddle with everyone hedging their bets is what would wind up happening; the U.S. would sign an agreement not to expand beyond the current base structure, and/or would scale back the number of soldiers deployed/equipment maintained there, and/or South Korea would close one or two of the bases, possibly just moving their assets elsewhere in the country.'

China is seeing great strides in its economy. Not for the whole population, but Shanghai and Guangzhou and other "Special Economic Zones" have soared with the use of capitalism plus authoritarianism.\n\nAgain, I\'m not advocating authoritarianism, but I am advocating capitalism. A more open marketplace in North Korea, along with the foreign investment that a one country-two systems policy can bring, can make life much better for the average North Korean citizen, with or without the Kims acting as dictators.\n\nWill some political dissidents get fucked over? Yeah, of course. But that is happening now. But the economic liberalization in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore has resulted in a political liberalization in time. So I have hope that North Korea can repeat the success of their Southern brothers.'

China is similarly very much against any action which destabilises NK - given the southern border can't be easily crossed, all refugees will be going North into China. No one want's ~10 million impoverished, unskilled peasants flooding their towns and cities. And who fills the NK space? China doesn't want a US ally on it's border - that's another reason China (a major trade partner for everyone involved) doesn't want military action taken. And how the aftermath?

They mean next to nothing compared to geo-politics.\n\n[This](http://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/is-india-the-latest-component-of-a-u-s-led-encirclement-strategy-against-china/) is what China is concerned about.  This is why they want to remove US influence over certain countries.\n\n\n&gt;Second, Chinese leaders tend to see various manifestations of a U.S.-orchestrated containment strategy directed against China. Washingtons so-called pivot to Asia, especially the emphasis on strengthening strategic ties with traditional allies such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, has already aroused Chinese suspicions. So, too, has the Obama administrations none-too-subtle tilt toward countries that dispute Chinas territorial claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea. In addition to Washingtons support for Tokyo and Manila, the administration has openly cultivated an informal strategic partnership with Hanoi, yet another rival claimant.\n\n&gt;Indications of meaningful security ties between the United States and India are, therefore, not likely to be seen merely as motivated by mutual concerns about Pakistan-based terrorism. Instead, the latest move looks suspiciously like an attempt by Washington to forge another link in a chain meant to hem-in China. The growth of military cooperation between India and Japan, Americas leading ally in East Asia, could be viewed as yet another link in such a chain.'

Do you want to know why they'd also want Pakistan to be close to the US at the same time?\n\nRemember the Bin Laden raid?  One of the helicopters couldn't make it out of there.  The Pakistanis invited Chinese engineers to take a look at it almost immediately after.\n\nYou ever look at the J-10 fighter that the Chinese started producing a few years ago?  Kind of looks like a F-16.  Probably because the Pakistanis provided one to the Chinese to study.\n\nIt almost sounds like Pakistan is a pretty reliable ally to China, doesn't it?  Nah, can't be.  Definitely not.\n\n&gt;No, they are not. I actually already pointed this out. Specifically. You're worrying about pawns on the chess board, while the US and Chinese are thinking 500 moves ahead. The Pakistani Taliban / Haqqini network are nothing but a distraction.

Just like the last century the unfinished business of one war will lead to an even bigger war. Absurd, completely and utterly absurd. \n\nPlot Prediction: Saudi Arabia and Turkey conquer Syria with ISIL. ISIL, or ISIL backed successors gain their caliphate in Syria. Iran (post 5+ deal is now stronger then ever) decides that a proxy and special forces war is no longer an option, takes the fight direct to the caliphate. Turkey stays out, because NATO at this point is practically willing to kick out the dam country in revenge for helping ISIL. Saudis support with lots of money, but the caliphate doesn't last. Saudi planes fly in, dog fights and bombing in caliphate airspace. Security council goes crazy threatens to do something, ends up not doing anything. \n\nWar escalates, troops from both sides meet for the first time in large combat operations. War goes international. Iraq joins the fight, after months of horrible insurgency in the north west. Kurds join in, work with Iran to stop an invasion from caliphate into their lands. Larger battles. UN is shitting its pans. Oil goes to 125 a barrel. US Navy reenforces the gulf in an attempt to prevent a stop in the flow of oil and a naval battle. \n\nThe world is starting to give a fuck. After two months news on the subject dies down, world stops giving a fuck. War is WW1 style, battle lines and trenches are everywhere. No major offensives, yet. The Iranian government wants to end the very unpopular war, to many people in Iran are reminded of the war in the 80's. Saudis see weakness give more money and support. Oil goes to 145 a barrel. Shits starts to get serious again. World economy is in danger. Very large offensive into caliphate, massive casualties. Saudi Arabia loses battle. Oil is 155 a barrel. \n\nDog fights over caliphate, Iran goes for the kicker and start doing massive bombing runs over caliphate cities. 200,000 dead escalates to 250,000 in less then three months. Turkey joins the battle, claims it fears invasion. Attacks Iranian planes. Iran responds. Oil stays at 155 a barrel, market cant handle any more. Fear of a naval battle in the gulf (preventing oil supplies) leads to massive support for the war to end. Europe finally takes action, doesn't really do anything. China starts supporting Saudi Arabia, they need oil to go down. US is refusing to reenter a war in the region again. Russia supports Iran, only in revenge for the elimination of Assad. Oil goes to 165, people start to go crazy with how much more expensive things are getting. Market confidence crashes. Massive support to end the war. Iran and Saudi Arabia pull back, caliphate becomes more like afghanistan then ever. Proxy war starts again. Shit is bad, but confidents goes up and oil goes down.

Please forgive my temporary TLDR.\n\n&gt; The research described in this report was conducted by the Science and Technology Policy Institute (operated by RAND from 1992 to November 2003) for the Office of Science and Technology Policy. \n\nJust want to point out it may not be up to date enough. In 1993 people were using a DOS Wedge to implement networking and Linux was version 0.99. Then again, embedded systems do not necessarily run on modern tech.\n\nI am not sure that the critical bits of manufacturing take place in the US any longer. At Compaq most of what we did was combine Chinese-made components (as of 2001).\n\nWorse, the integrity of the components is suspect.

China is willing to allow Russia the optics of this "great friendship", all the while holding the Russians over a barrel to get the best possible pricing on gas and technology transfers.  Putin\'s hope is that the very prospect of some Sino-Russian axis will be enough to stop Western leaders from punishing Russia.  That\'s why any time the Chinese and Russians even have a phone call, Sputnik and RT will be making sure you hear about it.  \n\nThere is much more to their relationship than simply the number of deals they sign.  The Russians are staring at a future where they are a third-tier military on their own continent, behind NATO and China respectively.  Spiffy new tanks are nice, but it\'s a 20th century war machine being pegged to fight a 21st century war.  \n\nFurthermore, if Russia goes ahead and signs the multitude of rail deals in the pipeline, they can expect a massive influx of Chinese.  The Chinese outnumber the Russians by an easy 10:1.  They\'re staring at a future where Russian civilization, if not consumed by the West, will be overwhelmed by the Chinese.\n\nSo these deals look way cool for Russia right now, but in 10 years when the Russians are looking up to the Chinese in almost every facet, I\'m not so sure they\'ll be feeling as comfortable.  Unless, of course, the Russians are content being the junior partner.  But historical precedence would suggest otherwise.'

This basically keeps the types that would be radicals out, for better or worse (probably better). I've seen like maybe 4 Indonesian women with Burka's in the entire 4 years I've been here. \n\nCulturally, Taiwan is very non oppressive and open to all creeds and sexualities.

I've seen some lighter forms of racism, and there definitely is classism (not a real word, but I hope that makes sense), but no place is perfect. \n\nThe police are competent and respectful here, at least from what I've seen. there seems to be a good amount of oversight both politically and corporately (well, not so much oversight, but if someone is caught cheating, or cutting corners, they get absolutely crucified in the media, no coverups or bailouts, so I guess that's something)\n\nThere are also a very high amount of cctv cameras in Taipei city, so there is very low crime compared to any other major city.

I gather the main UK involvement early in the Pacific War (that wasn't getting rekt like the rest of the West) was Burma, which was important, but the ~~larger~~ battles that really turned the tide were fought by the US and Australia, until late 1944 when the UK brought in a metric tonne of ships and played significant roles in battles near the end like Okinawa, and probably would've played a major role in Operation Downfall as well."

Of its 23 territorial disputes active since 1949, China offered "substantial compromises" in 17, usually agreeing "to accept less than half of the territory being disputed," M Taylor Fravel, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pointed out in the article "Regime Insecurity and International Cooperation: Explaining China\'s Compromises in Territorial Disputes," published in the journal International Security.*\n\nYou realize Tibet was never an internationally recognized sovereign nation, right? Even the British acknowledged it as part of Qing China, of whom the PRC and the ROC inherited their territorial claims from. The CCP basically retook it right after they won the civil war, which the KMT would\'ve done if they had won.

In fact they already have those territories on their official passports even though it is someone else\'s sovereign territory.\n\nThis century is seriously getting crazy.

Also you have to take into account how the global economy is doing and will be doing in the next years\n\nThat's true for both countries. China is still far behind the US in per capita terms and will be making up a lot of ground there.\n\n&gt;5 years ago experts said that the Chinese would overtake America in 2017.\n\nChina has already overtaken America in PPP terms.

Western Europe has become much more critical of the US in the last 20 years, and Asia has developed massively, but Western ideals and culture are as dominant as ever. Even the use of the US dollar has increased worlwide, even though its demise is predicted every few hours. The flow is still very much one way. Economically, things are most likely getting more lopsided again, because of automation and the desperate need of China to start internalizing their environmental costs.\nPeople always think the jobs went to Asia to stay there, but they only went there to die. Technological leadership is more important than ever and China is still playing a massive catch up game in a very quickly changing environment. The West has already adapted to many of these changes."

In the past we would park our carriers in the straight. They are become less and less afraid of that. And have recently developed tech to counter that.

That doesn't necessarily translate to PPP average but that too is projected to rise faster than any other country. It's beyond inevitable China will become the most powerful country on the planet. The next century will be that of China's. They've been incredibly smart about it as well.

aS'Demographics. They have had, for the past 20-30 years, the "perfect" boom. There\'s no old people or new children to consume resources and time, thanks to the one-child policy. People of working age can just work, everyone is of working age, you have a young population without having the economic drawback of dependent children and all that goes along with them.\n\nThat time is now over as of 2013. Every year from now on, the population ages and the workforce shrinks, and that decline will get steeper over time. Yes, in the **very** long run this is probably a good thing for an overpopulated country. \n\nHowever, the consequences for the rest of your and my lifespan is that China will get older and older. A larger and larger portion of the population will be infirm and need of care rather than working. Old people also don\'t tend to drive consumption, don\'t produce new innovations, etc. It\'s hard for their economy to grow/mature under such circumstances.\n\nTheir pension system is so underfunded it makes US states look responsible (it\'s underfunded by 150% of China\'s GDP)....and that\'s with it only being supposed to provide meager benefits.\n\nAnd unlike every country to come before (with less severe crunches) China isn\'t a rich country yet and won\'t be by the time these problems really start to come due.'

aS"yeah but those are relatively minor compared to what simmers beneath the surface. The Taiwanese government is the remnant of the Kuomintang, better known as the regime that Mao forced out of power when he established communist China. It wasn't until the 80s that China was even willing to recognize it as anything other than an island filled with rebels. What happens when the US decides it's not worth it to enforce their supremacy in the pacific rim? While we're talking about China, do you honestly think that they just forgot about what the Japanese did to them in WW2? Do you really think that they're not itching for the chance to pay them back for it?\n\nWhat about the middle east? Sure it's a shit hole, but it's a shithole where turks, persians, jews and arabs each have their own sovereign states. At every other point in history one of those brutally oppressed the others, or some foreign power just shit on them all and told them to fucking deal with it. \n\nWhat about Poland? We all like to forget about Poland but I guarantee you that the Russians are champing at the bit to get back everything behind the iron curtain. \n\nPakistan and India? They both have nukes and frankly wouldn't sleep much better at night knowing the other country was a radioactive wasteland. They don't because they know that whichever side limps out the victor will get to take home the first prize of a freedom brand can of whoopass.\n\nThe flaw with your analogy is that the geopolitical stage isn't a capitalist economy. Competition is necessary for growth in a capitalist society, when it comes to geopolitics competition takes the form of armed conflict. In a capitalist system you can take a company to court for pulling shady shenanigans, if there is no central power controlling the world then there's nobody to arbitrate if Mongolia decides they should be repaid in blood for the Bolsheviks wiping out their nobility.\n\nIs it a perfect system? No, far from it. But if the failure of the League of Nations taught us anything, it's that nation states only understand one thing, and that's who has the biggest stick."

China is playing the long game as its counting on the younger demographic of the world. It's soft approach is making a huge difference and is now successfully challenging the cultural hegemony of the west in the developing world.

The economy has been stagnate to poor for two decades. Defense spending is a way to artificially pump the economy. 2. China is a real threat to expanding their influence through the Pacific maritime region. They need to be able to defend their trade routes and assets in the region and don't want to be completely dependent on the US for that. 3. The Japanese were fully aware their great economic miracle was greatly due to the US taking care of security duties from the 1940's through 1980's and buying all of their exports. After two decades of economic stagnation though that feeling of closeness has soured, which is one reason why there has been a bigger backlash against US bases on the islands recently. The old relationship is looking antiquated and they want something new. \n\nStill, there is no doubt that Japan, a resource poor nation that was leveled after World War 2, owes a great deal to the Pacifist clause in their constitution.  \n\n"

To briefly respond to the one salient point you made, China may have invested heavily in Africa, but the United States still controls it. Example: Zimbabwe (might have been another, I may be mistaken on the exact nation) was recently going to buy Chinese arms. The United States put its foot down and pressured China to cancel the order. If they didn\'t, the USN would seize the vessel. Those "mind-blowing investments" don\'t mean that much.'

Even at the UN Security Council, they didn\'t back Russia up. \n\n**South China Morning Post** - [Russia isolated as China abstains in UN Security Council vote on Crimea](http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1449547/russia-isolated-china-abstains-un-security-council-vote-crimea)'

When there are multiple poles, the ones in power become anxious, and they are even quicker to take away rights, strip freedoms, or send troops away to die "because we need to if we want to beat the enemy!"\n\nBut if you take that all away and you have a fully unipolar world, then there is no motivation for that government to act against the interests of the people. \n\nImagine a parallel Earth that was the same as ours, only Russia and China were best best friends with the US and supported everything the US did. And let\'s say even Al-Qaeda supported the US because they knew "it was completely hopeless to go against the Americans allied with the Chinese and Russians"\n\n* Do you think the US would be investing as much into the military compared to our somewhat multipolar world?\n\n* Do you think the US would be able to pass the Patriot Act and have the NSA spy program if there was no geopolitical rivals, and no active terrorists that the US could use as a reason to argue for these programs?\n\n* Would the US be torturing people and spying on everyone, if no one was threatening to bomb the US, and if everyone was peacefully living under a strict US rule?\n\nGranted, I\'m **not** saying the world should be under full US rule and we should all be praying for the US to fully take over. I\'m just showing how, historically speaking, when there is one uncontested power there is generally less conflict and less oppression by that government. \n\nEven if you replaced the US with China in that scenario, do you think China would really be that authoritative if they knew they had full global control and no one could threaten them in the slightest? The Chinese leaders would be placated and relaxed in Beijing, and they wouldn\'t be imposing strict rules on human rights in the name of stopping propaganda because they would be no need to stop anything when the entire world is your ally.'

Wait until the bill for local debt comes due... \n\nSo many in the West have this absurdly rose tinted view of China's growth... it was insanely unsustainable and still is today.

That\'s fucking far away from the US.  Saddam, Al-Qaida, Lybia, ... . I have the feeling that the whole US agenda for foreign countries is to wreak havoc there to keep them weak or weaken them. \n\nI get their point, that of you are on the top you want to stay there, but the amount of chaos and deaths the US with the help of other western countries spreads is insane. Literally insane.\n\nRussia annexes Crimea and tries to stop a NATO expansion to its borders and it\'s solely the bad guy without thinking about the context what the US and their allies did in the last two decades.

America has values that we try to project onto the world, things that we stand for. We don't always live up to them, but at least they exist. What does China stand for?

Today china has a ppp gdp per capita of around 12 880 dollars or about the same level as most semi developed states on earth  whilst the US is at \n54 600 dollars per capita. whilst China is only 23.5% as rich as the US per capita it does show how much progress China has made and we need to remember that the US is absurdely rich even by developed country measures. If we instead compared China with some other developed countries like Japan for example  (ppp gdp per capita 37 400) it is 35% as rich. The comparison gets even more impressive  when you compare Russia(a supposed superpower) with just three coastal provinces in china, the coastal province of Jiangsu+ neighboring Zhejiang+Shanghai has a total gdp of some 3560 billion dollars ppp(as large as Russia) or 22 250 dollars (roughly equal to russia and remember that russia is around rank 50 of all the richest countries per capita) per capita spread across some 160 million people on an total area smaller than Kansas,now consider that these provinces  might grow around 6-7%(Russia at best might manage 1% growth) per year for atleast the next 5 years or so and you can see where the future is going,China is a hegemon in the making and there really isnt any doubt about it,Russia is at most a regional power.\n'

aS'A nation with a large amount of debt has to pay a large amount of interest on that debt, which is pretty much the extent of the problems caused by having a large amount of debt.\n\nIn all honesty, even the ratio of debt to GDP is a pretty bad one. It would be better to look at the ratio of the *interest* the country is paying on their debt to its rate of nominal GDP growth (which is essentially a combination of the country\'s rate of real GDP growth and its rate of inflation).\n\nThe key thing is that debt is valued nominally, not relatively. This means that as a currency inflates, debts held in that currency devalues - $100 today is "worth" much less than it would have been a hundred years ago, after all! But while a country could pretty much ignore its debt if it had a high enough rate of inflation, high inflation tends to cause a number of other problems.\n\nEven with zero inflation, a country with a high rate of real GDP growth (real GDP growth, of course, being GDP growth adjusted for inflation) can also safely hold a great deal of debt. This is because as the GDP of a country goes up, so does the government\'s revenue. This results in a situation that can be somewhat readily analogized to personal debt. Imagine you had a credit card that has a 5.0% yearly interest rate that you have a debt of $200 on, and your income is $1000 a year. This means you pay $10 a year in interest on that debt, or 1% of your income. But let\'s now say that, for some reason, your income is increasing at a rate of 5.0% each year. This would mean that after one year your income is now $1050 per year. Now, that $10 you are paying in interest is only 0.952% of your income. Moving forward, after another year it is only 0.907% and after a third only 0.864%. This growth assumes that inflation is zero, i.e. it is real growth.\n\nPart of the reason that the 2008 market crash was so bad for the US was that, for the first time in a long time, its nominal GDP *dropped* - to the tune of 0.30 trillion USD, or 2.04% of its pre-crash nominal GDP. But since then, the US has resumed a consistent rate of nominal GDP growth at about 0.5875 trillion USD per year, which translates to a yearly rate of increase of about 4%. The US pays a little over 2% interest on its debt, which is very low, comparatively speaking - this reflects the fact that the US is considered one of the safest possible investments (which, interestingly enough, is much of why the US Congress\'s near failure to pay its debts (the whole "debt ceiling" fiasco) was such a big deal).\n\nWhile I\'m not terribly familiar with Japan, something one notices right away about it is that its rate of nominal GDP growth is nowhere near as stable as the US\'s - while the US\'s has been positive for many decades with the exception of 2008, Japan\'s looks like [this](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?hires=1&amp;type=image/png&amp;chart_type=line&amp;recession_bars=off&amp;log_scales=&amp;bgcolor=%23e1e9f0&amp;graph_bgcolor=%23ffffff&amp;fo=verdana&amp;ts=12&amp;tts=12&amp;txtcolor=%23444444&amp;show_legend=yes&amp;show_axis_titles=yes&amp;drp=0&amp;cosd=1994-01-01&amp;coed=2014-10-01&amp;width=670&amp;height=445&amp;stacking=&amp;range=&amp;mode=fred&amp;id=JPNNGDP&amp;transformation=lin&amp;nd=&amp;ost=-99999&amp;oet=99999&amp;lsv=&amp;lev=&amp;scale=left&amp;line_color=%234572a7&amp;line_style=solid&amp;lw=2&amp;mark_type=none&amp;mw=1&amp;mma=0&amp;fml=a&amp;fgst=lin&amp;fgsnd=2007-12-01&amp;fq=Quarterly&amp;fam=avg&amp;vintage_date=&amp;revision_date=).\n\nSo simply holding a large amount of debt doesn\'t affect anything financially - that is left to the amount of interest a country is paying on their debt and the rate at which their nominal GDP is growing.\n\nPolitically speaking (which you probably aren\'t, but I\'d like to take a moment to address it anyway), debt has exactly zero effect. All those people who constantly clamor and wail over how "China owns the US!" and suchlike are completely incorrect. Not only are they incorrect factually (China holds a pretty small portion of the US debt, as it turns out), but conceptually too - in no way, shape, or form does holding a large portion of a country\'s debt grant you influence over it. Imagine if China somehow was able to demand the US buy back all of the bonds it owns - all that would happen is the US would finance it by selling bonds to other countries, the net effect simply being that the debt is moved from one holder to another.'

aS"In cultural terms, sure.   A few other countries are increasing their cultural exports (India, South Korea, Japan), but the US still has the edge there.\n\nIn economic terms, though, China is likely to pass the US in total GDP in another 10 years, and India may another 5-10 years later.   That doesn't necessarily translate directly to power, especially since the per capita GDP will still be so much lower, but it is an important type of power in itself, and it tends to strengthen every other type of power.\n\nAlthough the rise of Chinese and India economic power should decrease the risk of war; as economies grow, they will almost certanly just become more and more dependent on international trade and on each other.  Even now, anything that disrupted trade between, say, China and the US, would have devastating economic consequences for both countries, and that's only going to be more true in the future.    "
p809
aS"&gt;I have no expertise on the matter, but saying that China could be on par with America in terms of economic power sounds like a bold claim.\n\nNot quite yet, but soon.  Right now US GDP is about 16 trillion a year, and China GDP is about 9 trillion a year, but China is growing at 7% a year and the US is growing at about 2.5% a year.   At that rate, China will pass the US in total GDP in maybe another 15 years.\n\nOf course, once China actually becomes fully developed, it's growth rate will slow down to a first-world growth rate of 2.5%-3%, but that's quite a ways away.   \n\n&gt;A friend told me that the American and Chinese economies are so interlaced that the best thing for both countries is to keep it civil.\n\nYes, that is absolutely true, and will only become more true in the future.

aS'&gt;enemy of USA\n\nWell, according to many guidelines and laws (sometimes secret ones, whatever that means) I can be pretty much arbitrarily considered "enemy of USA" for undisclosed reasons and any time I can get raided, kidnapped and my ass can be drilled even if I didn\'t do shit ("secret reasons"). How your statist ass will explain to me how that was OK?\nIn before you say "but it didn\'t happen to you". It already happened to many others that physically could not do any harm that would allow such treatment. Most explanation you get is "oops" or nothing.\n\nAlso nice defending USA by actively trying to weaken encryption standards and security of information systems in your own country NSA jackasses. I couldn\'t give two shits about passive collection they are doing since you should assume it\'s done anyway but actively pressuring for clearly insecure algorithms to be used is beyond naive "defending USA". When you have an army that can invade whole world several times over only with conventional means, your main enemy isn\'t even China or Russia. It\'s the power hungry assholes inside. You can\'t justify overreaching and attacking civilian information security on international level trying to control all. Hell, let\'s say backdooring all widely used solutions is OK. Still, fucking over NIST and other standard bodies to adopt backdoored/flawed algorithms (Dual_EC_DRBG comes to mind) is just not excusable. Also it\'s not like NSA completed it\'s all defensive jobs or anything. There are shitloads of government computers with gaping security holes open to anyone. I feel like power hunger of US government will consume everything US people stand for in the first place.\n\nBefore people take it as an attack against national pride or something, all this applies to other governments too. It\'s clear that Russia and China are shitholes when it comes to digital freedom. Only temporary freedom they have is because of their government\'s incompetence or they just can\'t afford it (which is because of gov. incompetence ha). Don\'t become like them.'

aS'But consider we on the wrong side of the symbiosis.  In the broadest sense, we buy $400 billion a year in Chinese goods and they buy $400 billion a year in Treasuries which enables us to run $400 billion a year in deficits.  Does not work that simply of course but you get the point.\n\nThink this through over time.  After 10 years, we have bought $4 trillion of Chinese goods and accrued $4 trillion in IOUs.  Those IOUs must be repaid with interest.  As long as the dollar maintains its global dominance AND as long as there is a global surplus in supply of all things as there is now, then we can finance this deficit at a very low cost.  But what if, global demand - aka domestic demand in China - grows to where inflation rises and interest rates must in turn go up?  Suddenly the interest cost of carrying old debt (something that must be covered before you even consider borrowing even more money) goes up from say 1% to 5%, then the annual service cost of this debt rises from $40 billion to $200 billion.  We lose $160 billion in national purchasing power.  Now consider that the federal deficit is actually about $18 trillion a year and growing and could be around $20 trillion in todays dollars in ten years from now.  And lets say we pay an average of 3% today in interest and it rises to 6% in a decade (not an unreasonable assumption considering that the debt is termed out up to 30 years).  The annual interest cost of servicing the old debt would then rise by $600 billion a year.  And, if global finance market lose confidence in the strength of our economy and interest costs rise to double digits, then living standards will be in for a very bad time.\n\nSo back to symbiotic economies.  Each year, China is gaining capital investment, real economic production capabilities, skilled jobs, industrial infrastructure and each year the USA is gaining borrowed funds that enable us to buy foreign goods without the requisite capital investment, real economic production capabilities, skilled jobs and attendant infrastructure.  Who under those circumstances will have the greatest economic strength with which to back their currency and assure the global financial markets that they have the where with all to repay debts?'

aS'I think this is a fair question because of my brevity and essentially my foobar with "Americanization" when in reality, "Westernization" is a better term for the process I am pointing to. \n\nI understand China is the largest consumer of Ivory (though I am pretty sure this stat isn\'t per capita adjusted) but the real issue is why/how did China get into this market. We, the US, through our exploitation of the Chinese economy have essentially shot ourselves in the foot as an economy (in fact, if you look at Australia, a "western" state, it actually consumes more goods from the Asian economy than the US, simply because they produce goods more cost effectively -- and this was not so a few decades ago). So while China is essentially a communist nation, as an international player, they are just the same as the rest of the western capitalists and why, because that\'s how we prop\'ed them up with respect to using their economy to reduce the costs of "US" goods (note we don\'t even call many of these things US goods anymore... it\'s all made in china). So the point here is the greed that is embedded in capitalism is ultimately what is driving the desire for ivory. If it wasn\'t profitable, they wouldn\'t do it, so again we can look at the nations that need to do great protection of soon to be endangered species but you really cannot stop the issue until you fix the demand curve (which is to say change human desires, economy, etc). \n\nSo long story short, when you look at China and there new position to reign the global economy, note they learned most of their tricks (and desires) from the US (and the desires part is more apt for the word "Americanization" but the global capitalistic economy is more apt for the word "Westernization")\n\nEDIT: What I am pointing to is this idea, "whereever there is a will, there is a way". The demand curve sets the "will" of the consumer and as such, we have to address the "demand" for these goods to really stop the cruel injustice that is going on against so many rare animal species. But more so, the US was the primary instigators of such demand (both directly and indirectly). '

I just used that number because you listed it, knowing postdocs from China who made around that and were able to send money back, but my limited understanding of the medical profession in China is that they are poorly compensated (30k on average) and it is a lower prestige position compared to being a doctor in the United States. When China used to have performance based tests to determine future career specialties, medicine wasn\'t the highest on the list by any means. This website I saw seems to insinuate the average doctor in China makes ~30k a year. http://www.chinesemedicalnews.com/2014/03/how-much-does-average-chinese-doctor.html\n\nBut it\'s certainly possible they made more in private practice (though there seem to be some interesting insurance issues with that) or significantly more as a well-connected individual. Just saw your edit as well, and agree. Tainted food and medicine is a major issue; there\'s a high regard for American baby formula right now because of that.

But the West is like an entirely different world. People are really not well off at all. I think it may partly because that's where most ethnic minorities are, and the Han Chinese majority really do not see them as equals, whatsoever. The vast majority in Western China are very poor and cannot afford to live anywhere apart from their small inherited dust-packed shack-houses (constantly under threat of demolition with barely any compensation or relocation assistance/aid), or communist-era style high-rises favouring the maximum dependency of the worker on his/her work in urban factories with conditions near sweatshop level. Hardly anyone can afford a car, and Han Chinese are favoured consistently over minorities for higher paid job positions, the same occurs with the courts, the education system... You name it.\n\nPlus every time there's a big economic breakthrough in the West, e.g. a few years ago they found a bunch of oil in Xinjiang under the Taklamakan, the proceeds and monetary profit get funnelled eastwards, virtually in the same pipeline they use to chug oil towards the thirsty Eastern megacities... And Xingjiang barely benefits. It's no wonder they get big revolts and violent protests verging on terrorism, and have to send the army in from time to time.

Elders and the sick should remain indoors and avoid exercise. Healthy individuals should avoid out door activities."\n\nBeijing for example is something like an 800-900 on average. That\'s fucking triple the value listed as "Severely Polluted".  Beijing is the capitol. Factory towns are even worse, especially when it comes to waste dumping.\n\nI live in Taiwan and travel to China sometimes. I\'ve experienced it first hand. You blow your nose and BLACK comes out. I\'m not saying Chinese people are evil scum, not at all, but China is unquestionably polluted as all fuck, and it\'s not getting any better yet. They have talks and plans on how to improve it, but factories literally won\'t even use something like a carbon air scrubber because that costs money. \n\nAnyone that says China isn\'t massively polluted is either Chinese and blindly trying to defend their home, or a wishful fool trying to defend something they\'ve never experienced.\n\nNow, sure, every county going through its industrial revolution has polluted and most of us still do more or less. The difference is, 19th century civilizations didn\'t have the science or understanding about it all. That shit does not fly in 2015. Also, as I said, they willfully ignore measures that could reduce waste and damage solely in favor of profit. This happens in many other countries too, but we\'re not talking about that, were talking about whether or not China is severely polluted: it is. Scientifically even, it is.\n\nEdit: for further clarity, I\'m not denying the carbon footprint of America or any other country you wish to compare to. I\'ve never experienced pollution as bad as China in anywhere in the us. Also, the per capita statistic doesn\'t really matter when the air and water and earth are simply way worse in China. You also still have plenty of rural village living in areas of China. That\'ll skew results massively.  I\'m not talking about how wasteful one person on average is or isn\'t.

aS"Yes, it's skewed.\n\nHowever, it's skewed *in favour* of China as large populations are a lot harder to develop equally.\n\n\n&gt;I ask, because when you look sort by income inequality here China is actually worse than the U.S.\n\nThat's income inequality and a completely different concept than what we are discussing. Income equality is impossible to fairly manage in a capitalist system and supply and demand governing compensation of workers. Income equality can have a strong or weak effect on socioeconomic equality within nations depending on what measures are taken to continuously redistribute wealth (e.g. capital gain taxes, inheritance taxes, eminent domain, etc.).\n\nIncome equality is an example of something that will be impossible for China  (and everyone else) to develop sustainably and something that will get a lot worse in the future until eventually becoming better again due to the ability of the country to become more aocialist over time. \n\nDisproportionate compensation is part of the capitalistic development process of any nation, including China. China tries to compensate the inequality arising through capitalism by implementing its early socialist measures and is relatively successful in doing so. Especially China's fight for improving labour rights despite the onslaught of foreign lobbyism from the US and EU (who are trying to keep Chinese workers as cheap and exploitable as possible) is starting to prove successful, this is where people will see the most improvement in the near future."

China is stripping the mineral resources from large swathes of africa and installing only enough infrastructure to efficiently strip the resources.

All of the mineral extraction work and infrastructure development is contracted to chinese companies with chinese workers. The workers either send their money home or spend it in chinese owned shops within their own complex closed off to the locals. \n\nwhen the mineral resources have been exhausted the chinese state owned companies will pack up and leave an ecological disaster on worthless land. Some dictators will buy a few new sports cars. No locals will have recieved financial benefit. No locals will receive any skill training or wages or investment. Sure there will be some new roads through the ecological disaster but there will be no need for them because they will just go from a big worthless toxic hole in the ground to the nearest port.

aS'Chinese aid probably doesn\'t have more strings attached than Western aid. Especially not US aid.\n\nChinese aid is divided into loans and grants. Grants are usually for projects like constructing roads and housing, and in these there may be a lot of Chinese companies and Chinese experts involved. The loans are just loans- although these days they are more likely to be at market rate, they are unconditional. By comparison, loans provided by the West will be via the World Bank and the IMF and these have historically required adopting economic policies that are often quite painful for the receiving country.\n\nAs far as using Chinese companies and Chinese experts, well, other countries do that too. The US contracts out most of its direct aid (aid through the World Bank and UMF) to for profit American companies like Chemonics, Louis Berger, Tetratech and so on. They hire mainly American people who then set up and deliver projects directly, e.g. build schools, clear roads, etc, from safe and comfortable compounds in-country. Really not that different from what the Chinese are doing, although I would imagine a bit more expensive. A friend of mine was offered Chief of Party jobs for some of these firms and they both offered slightly over $300,000 per year plus some other benefits. \n\nJust in general, the idea of aid without strings is not very realistic. Even the most benevolent donors tend use it to put pressure on other countries, e.g. on women\'s rights. Countries that use it to put pressure more aggressively on countries to align with their own economic interests (like the US and China do) are really only doing what their voters, people or stakeholders want them to do. China and the US don\'t even really present their activities as benevolence- China talks about the "mututal benefit", and the mission of USAID is "We partner to end extreme poverty and to promote resilient, democratic societies **while advancing our security and prosperity**." Their site used to say "Foreign aid in the interests of the American people" but they took that down, too blatant I guess.'

aS'I\'m sorry, but the picture you\'re trying to paint is simply not true. \n\nAs soon as the Dutch took control, they burned down aboriginal villages, suffocated them in caves, and enslaved them.\n\nTaiwan\'s first rule by China was by Ming loyalists when they besieged the Dutch settlements in 1662. The aboriginals defected against the Dutch and sided with the Ming after they were offered amnesty. The welfare and alliances of the aboriginals were important to both the Ming and Qing, aboriginals were allowed to own land (though taxation of this land was a source of conflict) and Han immigrants were not to settle in aboriginal land. Even though there was ongoing acculturalisation and numerous small scale conflicts and disagreements, Qing rule of Taiwan was a relatively peaceful era for the aboriginals.\n\nJapan justified their invasion of Taiwan as reconcilement for the aboriginals killing the crew of a wrecked Japanese ship over 20 years prior. This gave them the sentiment that the aboriginals were cruel and vicious, and they were to be conquered or gotten rid of. Many aboriginal tribes were destroyed by Japanese shelling, bombardment, and quarantines. They were in a state of constant struggle and war against the Japanese authorities. In WWII, aboriginals were used as comfort women along with the Chinese.\n\nAt no point in Taiwan\'s history did China come close to "killing and eating most of the aboriginals".'

If everyone in China is getting richer, then the rich are getting exponentially richer and the poor are getting richer at less than a snail\'s pace. Not to mention the price of accommodation and amenities everywhere is skyrocketing, and most wages are really not. My dad had a good position as a senior lecturer at a good university in the West for several years and when we moved to Beijing for a year, even we could barely afford to rent accommodation anywhere close to his new job.\n\nI currently live in the UK, and it is a completely different world again. Honestly, I can\'t speak for the US but China certainly is far less equal than the UK is, in provinces such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, Gansu, and many parts of Sichuan. And seriously: the ethnic minorities have it the worst - the Uyghurs, Kazakh, Hui, Tibetans, Salar, Tartar, Manchu, Mongols... employers almost ALWAYS favour Han Chinese applications, minorities usually have very limited chance of promotion, many minority-led businesses are denied opportunities... all in this complex system of ["guanxi"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi) where it\'s all about saving / losing face with people you have connections or social debts with - minorities are almost never given equal opportunity with the Han majority.

aS'Yes. And this is the most speculative of my assumptions and you may be correct.  The scenario I see is that over time China grows its domestic demand economy and continues to rise the value added chain where low cost labor is outsourced to other nations as is already occuring.  At some point in the future, it will be in China\'s best interests to have a strong currency in order to lower the costs of the tremendous demand for imported raw materials to support domestic demand.   In fact, recent trends in factory automation may accelerate this "tipping point" (normally detest that term).\n\nAlso, i have a difficult time understanding how economic imbalances can remain in place indefinitely.  Can the model of net importing $400 billion a year of Chinese goods last forever?  \n\nAnd, there is a considerable economic advantage given to the economy of the nation who possesses the global currency of choice.  China is aware of this and is moving towards making the Yuan an international currency to at a minimum share the international stage with the dollar.\n\nChina\'s labor force is young but rapidly aging due to their one child policy.  There will come a time when domestic labor needs to be used to tend to domestic needs - health care for example, rather than the production of goods for export.\n\nFinally, this scenario assumes we continue to weaken our economy relative to theirs from the standpoint of production capabilities, weak savings and investment to where global confidence in the ability of our economy to back our debt obligations weakens relative to the global confidence in China\'s.\n\nAnd - second finally - just the scale of China, when per capita incomes approach ours, China\'s GDP will be 4x ours, will dictate that they are the dominant global currency of choice by the rest of the world.\n\nSo, yes, there will be very strong internal pressures within China to maintain the status quo of supporting a manipulated weakened currency in order to continue mercantile economic policies based on exported goods, and these forces will prevail for far longer than they should if governed strictly by market economics.\n\nHowever, at some time in the future, these artificial manipulation will have to self correct, and China\'s currency will have to seek equilibrium at the much higher valuation that markets deem it is worth.\n\nWhat is totally uncertain is when does this happen.  5, 10, 20 years from now?  And will it be gradual - as they are attempting to achieve by slowly revaluing the Yuan - are will some event trigger a rapid revaluation with attendent destructive economic consequences?\n\nThe Chinese leadership is fully aware of their longterm goals and is striving to "scientifically manage" this economic transition.  Whether they can achieve this smoothly without making gross mistakes, or whether the markets override their efforts, no one knows.\n\nSo, back to your statement, yes China will want to keep its currency devalued for as long as possible to maintain its exporting model.  However, it cannot last forever and more importantly, as their economy transitions to one of domestic demand, the time will come when it is no longer in their best interests to let it continue.\n\nRemember, China does not make all of our stuff just because they are nice guys.  They are doing this as a means towards an ends, the ends being the wealth and prosperity of their own society.'

aS"I think in most cases it's fine, but there are some places that we have an obligation to work to protect. For better or worse, biodiversity hotspots largely fall in poor countries, and these are the places that are valuable to protect for both science and the health of the planet.\n\n\nThere also isn't a huge double standard here. The opponents of the Serengeti Road, for example, are trying to help fund an alternate route to the south that wouldn't ruin the migration/ecosystem. The point here is that international finance and companies based in the Europe/USA/especially China are funding shitty projects. Development is fine if it improves standards of living, but the roads enable logging operations and huge cattle ranches just end up 1) displacing people that lived in the forests beforehand, and 2) ruining the land/water. We can have responsible development without fucking everything up. Eventually, we'll have to stop population growth and stop trying to expand humanity's footprint on the planet, but not before we improve standards of living for the poorest people. That can be done without fucking up every ecosystem on the planet."

aS"Why is my personal experience of 11 years living in 6 different places across China, *entirely irrelevant*?\n\nChina doesn't even let many reporters / statisticians go to the West, at all. And if they do, they are very often given a specifically arranged escort to present specific parts of the West that will look good on China's record. We were some of the only few foreigners living in our city at one point, and we met a stats guy. I was only a teenager then, but it was clear to us the Chinese escorting party was very adamant that the stats reporter meet us to promote the idea that even British foreigners are drawn to China for its wonderful opportunities. We weren't there for opportunity, we were there to help educate people (at university-level right down to basic literacy/numeracy) and do development work via an NGO to try and help the neediest that the local governments refused to give any time to.\n\nI wish I knew better but by the looks of your comment history, you have a very pro-China and anti-anything else (especially the US, which I'm indifferent to) rhetoric. I'm not anti-china, I love China. It's my home from home. I just happen to be extremely wary of its government, for very clear reasons."

aS"If the US stopped intervening the China would grab Taiwan. Japan would nuclearise. Iran would nuclearise and Saudi Arabia would do so in retaliation. Russia would grab the Baltic States and maybe Finland. \n\nI.e. it would be pretty much a rerun of the 1930's. Another period when the US was isolationist. Inevitably one of the land grabs would trigger a war which the US was dragged into. Like it was in 1941. The UK tried to stay out of WWII too, but was eventually dragged in over Poland, though it didn't actually fight until Germany attacked the UK expeditionary force in Europe. At that point it came very close to losing. Japan attacked the US because it saw the US as being able to stop its expansionist plans in Asia and decided rather foolishly that a pre-emptive attack would stop this. \n\nAt the worst point in WWII there were only around ten democracies left - Nazi  Germany and the USSR had overrun almost all of Europe\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#/media/File:Number_of_nations_1800-2003_scoring_8_or_higher_on_Polity_IV_scale.png\n\nRight now China is equally foolishly developing AA/AD and 'Assassin's Mace' weapons to either stop the US intervening in support of Japan or Taiwan or to deal such a heavy blow to US forces that it stops the intervention. Japan has loads of plutonium and solid fuelled space launch rockets that would make excellent ICBMs. The only reason it doesn't declare itself as a nuclear power is that the US has instead put Japan under its nuclear umbrella. However if the US stopped that policy, it'd go nuclear. Of course there's no saying how China would react to that development. given that Chinese and Japanese ships clash all the time over the Senkakus. Also Taiwan and South Korea probably have the capability to go nuclear but choose not to because the US guarantees their safety.\n\nWhat happened in Ukraine shows that Russia hasn't given up on 19th Century style territorial expansionist. It is deterred from attacking NATO powers though, primarily because of US military power. Still if the US pulls the plug on NATO it may well decide it could take out the UK and convince France to stay out of the war. In that case it could then do what it wanted in Eastern Europe. \n\nIran is non nuclear but could make nukes in a year or so. Saudi Arabia could buy them from Pakistan. Israel is an undeclared nuclear state and may well strike pre-emptively if Iran has nukes. Or it may not, it is not clear what its red line is.\n\ntl;dr - the US going isolationist could easily trigger one or more wars which the US is eventually dragged into. I.e. I'm sure many US administrations have considered some sort of isolationist strategy. There are reasons why no one who understands foreign policy is seriously suggesting it now."

China doesn't invade Taiwan because they won't declare themselves to be an independent country. Even if they did almost no country recognizes them anyway. \n\nUS is adept at bombing terrorists who hide in caves, that's it. \n\nNorth Korea shelled a South Korean island AND sunk a South Korean sub. Not only did the US FAIL to prevent such attacks, it didn't do anything in retaliation.\n\nWhether it is Eastern Ukraine, or the South China Sea, or Iran's nuclear issue or North Korea, the US has no results to speak of despite people like you circle jerking soft and hard power.\n\ntldr: you said nothing new and still can't provide a single example where the US has solved a major Russian or Chinese issue with either soft or hard power."

That in itself stops those countries from getting frisky, like Russia and China have been getting (not threats to trade because they all benefit from it). France helped the US gain independence which also I spired the French Revolution, but the US came to Europe's aid in WWII.

Three of those countries have their entire economies pegged to the value of certain commodities and most trade being performed (and will in the foreseeable future still be performed) in US dollars.\n\nIn the case of the US military... I don\'t know what you think "spread thin" is. The "small" contingents spread out in each corner of the world is enough to flatten any nation except for Russia and China (I don\'t count France and the UK because they\'re their allies), and in case of necessity the US can reinforce and double any such contingents within 24-48 hours. \n\nRegarding soft power... The US has commercial and diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world, and is Top 3 economic partner with the majority of the countries in all continents.

p972
aS"It is certainly a clusterfuck. But I think that side of things has improved in the last 10 years. \nIt's funny how you go through quite a lot of testing to get your license. With lots of rules. \nAnd then the moment you get it, all the rules are disregarded. \n\nI get pulled up all the time, not being asian. I think most of the appeal is just making sure their eyes aren't playing tricks. Not many white people in rural China. Almost always they let me go after fussing for a moment. Occasionally they pretend I did something wrong and I pretend I can't speak Chinese. 5 minutes pass, it goes away.\nIf I actually did something wrong, I'd haggle a bribe. \n\n\nSo. In summary. I don't think that means they have a lighter touch - I think that means they have different expectations. Maybe a lack of expectations as a result of learning from a generation of people that starved, missed out on education, and will happily kill their neighbour's dog if it's barking. "
p973
aS"The issue isn't whether there's a majority or a minority. The issue is that there is enough of this happening to warrant international attention. China tried to politely encourage their citizens about manners while traveling abroad, but there were still a substantial number of incidents happening. The reason is because there are a lot of families who just recently became affluent. One or two generations ago, they were farmers. So then government made an effort to educate people about acceptable behavior abroad. Because of the massive campaign to raise awareness, nobody can claim ignorance.  Incidents have still been happening, which greatly embarrasses the country and creates issues for other countries, so now you're seeing a blacklist for repeat offenders. It's perfectly logical and I'm confused why people are condemning it as being unfair. "
p974
aS"&gt; The excuse was that these citizens were damaging the reputation of the US so they should be blacklisted. \n\nNo, it wasn't.  The Soviets getting the bomb, the rise of communist China and the discovery of Soviet atomic espionage threw the Red Scare into overdrive.  The suspected affiliation with communist groups, subversive thoughts, and disloyalty were what got people blacklisted.  They didn't get blacklisted for making the US look bad; they got blacklisted for suspected disloyalty, espionage and possibly harboring thoughts of communist uprisings."

aS"That's cute. China is only an acceptable place to live if you happen to not be part of one of the many groups they have decided deserved to be persecuted. But don't worry citizens the Cultural Revolution is a thing of the past (unless you annoy the wrong official's wife)."

aS'I would say right now SA is worse but there are a good few points you could jump to in time where I would say China has the edge. The primary difference is that China is simply better at controlling their image.'

aS"And China is a lot more Western. They're overall selectively Western and selectively democratic and capitalistic "
p980
aS"Fair enough, but China is homogeneous enough that &gt;90% of the people living there aren't going to be persecuted. Meanwhile, many black people and minorities in the US are persecuted, and they comprise of much more of the population. Not persecuted to the same extent, of course, but the point is that no country is perfect for everyone living in it.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what your point about the Cultural Revolution is. It is a thing of the past; the proletariats revolted against the wealthy and intellectuals in order to purge capitalism redistribute the wealth, but nowadays it's the engineers and intellectuals who are politically connected and making bank off of capitalism."
p981
aS'&gt; China is implementing a social rating system that will rate everyone based on their behavior \n\nFUCK THAT SHIT'
p982
aS"I can agree with that, but this doesn't affect the vast majority of the citizens who don't have strong political aspirations.\n\nI'm not saying that such circumstances are OK in a country, but your comment made it seem like everyone in China has been, is being, or will be targeted at some point in time, when in reality the majority of the population today is unaffected and won't be. China likes the social stability it has now; the economy is good, citizens are acquiescent, and things generally work out. No one's going to be toppling established political structures like they did in the Cultural Revolution."
p983
aS"No country's history is free of atrocities but the point is China is still playing the same game today. The persecution of so many people that it is simply staggering. China may change some day but for now it is still stuck in the 1800's in regards to how it handles its people."
p984
aS"And those tourists should be banned as well from leaving the country.  However, the most highly reported cases are Chinese tourists, and at least China is doing something to recover their reputation.\n\nIt's not about a race thing, but rather cultural and monetary.  There's quite a big income gap in China, and well anyone who's very well-off is typically due to exploiting the working class in China.  These same people could only hold these jobs if they're that self-centered to exploit said working class, and because they have more money they have more visibility.  \n\nNow, I hate how China hasn't really put any actual definitions of what qualifies, but at least they are trying to provide a reason for the 5% of disrespectful Chinese tourists to not be disrespectful.  "
p985
aS"I guess I'm alone in thinking China is doing the right thing? This stuff is awesome. In a world of decreasing accountability and increasing anonymity, China is holding their citizens accountable for their actions and applying real-world consequences. "
p986
aS"Fair enough. I agree that it feels very wrong that a good number of people are very strongly oppressed because China does not have freedom as a value enshrined in its culture or legislature. It's much more concerned about social order and stability, which, from a practical point of view, is how China has been able to so rapidly modernize and economically develop as a country. Balancing the two will be a task that China will have to face if it wants to seek international approval."
p987
aS"I hope the West listens to this. If Africans start turning to the East for trade and business this could be a very large problem. There are way too many resources on the African continent that can't be found in as large of quantities anywhere else. Trade lines between Africa and China go back thousands of years in some cases b/f they were interrupted forcibly by Europe. It's a shame b/c a stable wealthy Africa could make a great consumer base for our high quality products."

aS"If it wasn't Zuma then it would hold more weight. I think the only other leader whose opinion would hold less weight is Mugabe's.\n\nI don't know what to say with regards to the China/West argument for development. China is undeniably efficient, but I don't think they are particularly less resource-oriented than the West (if not more). With the West you are more likely to have transparency which has its obvious benefits, but then again Africa for the most part doesn't care about that since most political leaders are corrupt themselves.\n\nI am sort of expecting China to rise in power and influence in the region and then screw the Africans over to which the West will then be blamed for not protecting them from China."

aS'Posting those particular wikipedia articles really doesn\'t really reflect general life in China.  \n\nYes, there were shitty incidents like the black jails but that really has nothing to do with police-that was all about weird rural city governments with power crazed mayors who were basically mobsters trying to prevent people from complaining to the actual central government about their assholery.  IIRC one city was so corrupt the mayor had tanks and stuff and was forcing people to work in some factory for free. \n\nBut picking these incidences of abuses to represent China is like picking that [american town where the judge kept sending kids to jail to make money for himself as your example of how "judges in america" are.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal)  That one crazy ass judge doesn\'t mean that every judge in america is sending kids to jail to make money any more than the crazy ass mayor who set up black jails to prevent people from complaining about him in Beijing represents daily life in China.  You can selectively pick shitty things that happen in any country but that doesn\'t mean that daily life in those countries is represented by those incidents, otherwise Chinese people would just point to Baltimore and think the US is just a big country of police injustice and violent rioters.  \n\nIn China it\'s pretty simple, as long as you don\'t try to protest against the communist party\'s rule, and you\'re not yourself a super corrupt politician, and you don\'t kill nobody, you can basically do all sorts of stupid shit and even if it\'s obviously crazy ass illegal, they\'ll just give you a slap on the wrist if you get caught.  People have regularly built their questionably safe homemade airplanes and flown them in China, which would basically get your ass thrown in jail by the FAA here, but they basically got a stern lecturing and sent on their way in China.

p996
aS'except this doesn\'t happen even half as often you brainwashed pigs think it does. I\'ve lived in a China for half my life and I have rarely ever seen people take shits in public places. I really have to venture out into the farmland, and even then people still use the privy. It was not until I discovered reddit until I realized that there was this supposed problem, but I now firmly believe it\'s all BS. Also you have to understand that by insulting mainland chinese, you\'re insulting the people I love the most (close family members and friends), so you can kindly fuck your white ass off.\n\nAnd either way, you guys don\'t seem to have a problem with Japs or Koreans. Perhaps it is a culture thing; one thing is for sure, when China reaches it\'s maximum potential and attains Japan\'s level of supposed "sophistication" there is no stopping them. After all, it\'s still a developing country that is doing a lot better than european powers when they were still developing, economically as well as environmentally. '
p997
aS"&gt; If they act civilly, I assume they're from Hong Kong or Taiwan.\n\nHow will you know whether or not people from mainland China are actually civil if you brush every single one that behaves in such a manner as someone from Hong Kong or Taiwan?"
p998
aS"They're not necessarily the same people though, I doubt that he's friends with that many nong people (which, for redditors who don't understand Chinese, are basically hicks except they've largely migrated to cities to get better jobs).  He's probably friends with normal middle class urbanites who don't go around shitting everywhere, but it's the rural hicks who go around shitting everywhere that gross him out.  I will say that even city folks on average are slightly grosser than their American counterparts, I remember an awful lot of people going to the bathroom to do #2 and not washing their hands afterwards, whereas in the US I usually only see people peeing and then not washing their hands afterwards.  I chalk it up to the fact that when they grew up they were shitting in public toilets that were just holes in the ground and there was no sink at all to wash your hands in so they just never learned to wash their hands.  But most middle class folks behave a lot better than their counterparts who hail from rural China, and behavior like shitting everywhere is definitely a rural thing.\n\nIf you're from a country with people of Chinese heritage who are better behaved you probably generally think of them as people who value education and who tend to be relatively intelligent.  Except that's only true because only the smarter and then later more educated people managed to leave China, whereas all the really uneducated and rude idiots stayed behind.  So then you go to China and it's like holy shit, these people are insane.  To be honest I didn't see that many people shitting everywhere when I went to China (and I've gone a few times for a few months each) but what drove me crazy was how lines basically didn't exist.  There were just like, piles of people shoving and yelling to be in front of the mass of people.  And the worst part was that customer service people would only help people who were rude and screaming-when I politely asked for help they basically told me no.  Wtf?"
p999
aS"While that may play a part, have you been to China? The cultural standards for some things are just well and truly different. China has already created travel guides for Chinese tourists which informs them of things that aren't socially acceptable in other countries."
p1000
aS"The US made a secret No Fly list to supposedly counter terrorism with arbitrary selection rules and enforcement, it's a terrible idea which is why many loudly oppose it. China has made a public list of people who commit assaults and offences overseas (NOT arbitrary) and is trying to curb that behaviour, seems like a good idea to many.. they have 1.5bn people to inform that this bad behaviour overseas is not acceptable, so this policy is objectively a good way to achieve their goal quickly.\n\nYour edits:\nA tourist from a different country murdered someone - and that has relevance how? Do Dutch tourists regularly murder overseas?\n\nAnd if that didn't convince people, also.. obscenely wealthy people get away with bad behaviour on planes, so why should Chinese travelers be punished?\n\nYou're welcome to disagree with China's policy and join the conversation, with, perhaps..  reasons? But all you've shared so far is a list of false-equivalents, which the Reddit hive-mind you lament seems to have enjoyed enough to upvote 950-odd times."

aS"Yes, I'm Chinese and I used to live in China (currently in the United States for college). However, I lived in Hong Kong, which is very 'westernized', but I have visited many locations in mainland China and Taiwan, both rural and urban. I honestly never experienced any crazy or vastly different social and cultural standards. I've also never witnessed any of the things people experience with Chinese people, so I would say I'm very fortunate.\n\nI've heard a ton of horror stories just from people who live in Hong Kong about Chinese tourists from the mainland, but considering how Hong Kong people in general look down upon or even hate mainland Chinese people, those stories always seemed very biased. Every mainlander I've met so far are as polite and considerate as anyone else, but there might be some bias in there as they were all well-off and educated. \n\nI'm sure there are plenty of rude Chinese tourists who don't know what the hell they are doing, but I guess I've just been very lucky and have always met people who aren't complete asses, so I'm completely missing a part of the story."
p1004
aS'i disagree. i actually think traveling abroad is much more affordable today than it was, giving many more opportunities for people who have never traveled before to leave the country and bring their expectations with them. \n\nthe wealthier tend to have traveled more and be more adjusted to different surroundings. or, they simply have enough money to make sure they are surrounded by the same comforts, even when in India or another developing country. \n\nthe ugly American comes from both the wealthy and the new travelers. it frequently comes from students going abroad for the first time - who are likely obnoxious in the university town where they study as well. \n\nthey stereotype definitely originated in the 50s though and is parodied quite well in the movie OSS 117: Lost in Rio. that\'s when Americans started to become more visible because not all of them were speakers of multiple languages any more. and Americana started to appear everywhere.\n\nAmericans are in a unique place because \'American culture\' appears in so many places with both a positive and negative impact. and of course people are more vocal about the negative impacts, and even if they are just joking around about McDonald\'s being "real" American food, it has a type of reinforcing effect where people associate things.\n\nAmericans certainly are frequently loud, but there are just a lot more of them also. it\'s hard to say they are louder than the Russians or Israelis or Indians here in Bangkok. it\'s hard to say the Americans are louder than groups of Scots or English Lads that i\'ve encountered all over the world. or Italians. \n\nthis most recent bout that everyone is having with the Chinese has been super clear here in Thailand. they\'ve gone beyond the typical ugly American stereotype by kicking bells at temples with their feet (really, really uncool here), screwing up bathrooms so bad they have bathrooms specifically for them, and pushing their way through lines (i\'ve experienced this one multiple times). it\'s partly due to the way trips are organized for them with these mass tours (what a nightmare) and partly due to the fact that the ugly American was/is still much wealthier than the rude Chinese traveler and has much, much more exposure to international culture before they travel.\n\nit\'s easy to take for granted (and blame on individual Chinese offenders), but open internet, chatting with people, and while limited, the international programming and characters from different countries in programs/movies is exponentially higher than what Chinese experience. they are often culturally isolated and their government is actually largely to blame. \n\nonce again China is trying to chop a head off of a hydra instead of figuring out why the problem is getting so nasty and out of control. \n\nat the moment though, the rude Chinese are far worse than the ugly American was/is. '
p1005
aS"First China overtook the US as the world's most polluting nation, now also as the nation withe most obnoxious tourists. I think the next logical steps would be for China to start invading a few places, imposing their laws abroad, and maybe insult their friends a bit."
p1006
aS"Its easy to look at the surface article and say that the Chinese government is trying to curb a unfortunate social tendency that has been gaining wider attention... But I am very afraid for the Chinese with laws like these coming into existence. \n\nThe Chinese government has already instituted a citizenry rating system that could affect what is being termed societal credit scores. These scores have real effects on a person in that it could affect their employment prospects or finances. That doesn't even touch on the fact that associating with people of low social scores can negatively impact your own score. And things like video games, and viewing porn can affect you.\n\nNow this... It seems like a Orwellian tactic to control and limit movement of a citizen. When the idea of it affecting civil liberties is brought up, it is side stepped with the idea that it will affect so few. \n\nCan we guarantee people who might be critical of a ruling political party one day may find their options to flee the nation barred. Can they seek asylum. I mean they have essentially turned China into a pension state. And only people who do and say what the wardens want to hear get to go on field trips out. \n\nI've said it for years but China is scaring me more and more every day. In 5 years, is it possible they could go north Koreas route? A rogue state abusing its citizens, violating human rights, but to big and dangerous to reign  in."

p1008
aS'China is certainly on a path to be a major world superpower, but it will have to reform the education system first.  \n\nChina has a lot of problems right now but that\'s still the result of the Cultural Revolution.  It will improve and it will get better.  \n\nI urge you not to take this so personally.  If your family and friends don\'t take craps outside of KFC, don\'t let their children crap in the aisle of an airplane or blow their snot all over the street, then you don\'t have anything to worry about.  People aren\'t talking about you or your family then.\n\nIf you said something like "All Americans are so fat, it\'s so gross, DISGUSTING fat Americans, what pigs!" I wouldn\'t take it personally because no one in my family is even considered "overweight" by BMI standards.  The United States does have an issue right now with obesity, but my family doesn\'t.  I have some friends that do, and I\'d agree with you that it has a problem in general.\n\nI\'d also be careful about making this about race with comments like "so you can kindly fuck your white ass off." or "Only difference is at least the major superpower will be asian, as it should be."  \n\nYou seem to be very, very angry about this, and I urge you to try to let that anger go.  I don\'t think your family moved abroad so that you could rage on the internet about how angry you are.'
p1009
aS'They don\'t need this law to restrict people\'s movement.  They could already do that.  This is about making a public list, preventing those who have previously done wrong from doing it again, and providing incentive to others not to fuck around in other countries.  Instead of people just jumping on the bandwagon of, "they\'re trying to imprison people," people should give it a chance and see what effect it actually has.  This is very clearly a law about punishing unreasonable behavior overseas.  They didn\'t need this to restrict movement.\n\nAlso, you say it makes sense on a broad base, but the united states has a list of people that we don\'t allow to travel, and it\'s a shitshow of random brown people, actual terrorists, and enemies of politicians and people who make the list.  It\'s all well and good to talk about freedom, but if we look at this honestly, the US has a horrible record with these sort of things.  Our government is currently way out of line between domestic spying, the massive datacenters, the no-fly list, wiretapping the conversations of our allies, government sponsored torture, Guantanamo bay, and much more.\n\nSure, China restricts some freedoms of the people that live in the country, but on the other hand, because they\'re not scared of criticism from the public and have much more power, they\'re able to accomplish a lot of really big projects like infrastructure improvement, building entirely new cities from scratch, etc.  It\'s a double edged sword really.  Yes, centralized/non-democratic governments often limit the freedoms of the citizens, but they\'re a lot more effective at accomplishing tons of other things.  It\'s amazing how much you can get done when there\'s a single ruling party, and not 3 branches of government all representing different interests and trying to stick it to eachother.'

aS'You are right.  Not every Chinese tourist is like that.  I have worked in tourism for a number of years and am still involved indirectly, I have even actually worked in mainland China.\n\nI can tell you what the problems are  (the following contains generalizations about Chinese travel groups):\n\n*  Sudden increase in middle class in China has allowed people more than ever to travel, which has lead to:\n           -  Large amounts of Chinese travelling\n           -  Large amounts of Chinese who have previously had little westernization in their lives travelling\n\n*  Chinese travel in tour groups, fairly large ones often.  They are also in a BIG HURRY. They are only given a short period of time to be in the country they are in.  Example - there is a tour that runs out of China that does Australia and NZ in something like 7 days.     How do they do that?  They go to as many places as possible as quickly as possible.  Chinese are BIG on taking photos.  Photos are the proof to take back home to show everyone what they saw, and they definitely want to have as many DIFFERENT photos as possible with many special (and perhaps in your eyes, not so special) objects as possible - that random fountain, that big tree, that statue, that shop, that dog, that whatever.\nLarge groups being moved quickly through densely populated areas, who all desperately want photos are NOISY and they push one another and others and yell loudly to one another to get their photos done.\n\n* Mainland Culture.  You don\'t understand it... and you don\'t like it.  That\'s a HUGE part of the issue.  Things that are normal in China, things that I had to get used to living there, are foreign to you, but not just foreign, they are seen as rude and classless to you (general you).\n \n\n     - In China is it ok, and VERY common to spit on the ground (and make gross hacking sounds while doing it) you will see old women, men, whatever doing this.\n\n    - In China, baby/toddler type children wear, I dunno, "jumpsuits"? that have a flap around the butt that can be unbuttoned... and they dont wear nappy underneath.  They undo that flap and will let the baby pee on the ground or in a trash can or some such.\n\n   -  Chinese people talk loudly.  They live in a country that is densely populated... you need to speak up if you want to be heard.  The language is also tonal, so the same \'word\' to us can be pronounced with various tones to have different meanings - so the language sound is foreign to us, and often native english speakers find the language \'brash\' and \'ugly sounding\'.\n\n   - Again population based, if you live in Beijing, you are surrounded by people, cars, bicycles and all sorts of of hackneyed vehicular messes constantly, when the bus comes... and there are shit loads of people waiting for it - you gotta just go for your life.\nAint nobody got time or space for a queue. \n\n\n*  Chinese have insulated tours (often) where they see all the sights in that country, but will eat at Chinese restaurants the majority of the time, their guide will be Chinese, their driver will often be Chinese (but living in the country they are visiting) so they are surrounded by their own culture whilst on tour - they don\'t get much interaction with the people of that country - there is no time, the tour isnt sold to them with that in mind.  \n\n\n*  In Rural areas of China, outdoor ablutions are common.   In China the squat toilet is very prominent - except in Hotels and in shopping malls and tourist areas they now have both squat and \'western\' toilet.  The squat toilet is considered to be healthier and cleaner than the throne style westerners use.    \nThere is a big cultural divide around ablutions.\n\n\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\n\n*  Food choices and delicacies they bring with them whilst travelling is also a bit of an issue.  Unfortunately, Chinese have a bit of reputation of bringing in things that aren\'t allowed - such as medicines with ingredients disallowed in most western countries, also fruit and other fresh products.  \nWhether a language barrier, just not realizing or just \'hoping that the fresh ginseng plants in my bag wont get caught\' or whatever it is... it\'s a concern for countries with who require very strict biosecurity controls to protect their environment and wildlife.\n\n'

They could already do that.\n\nWhat this guy said, people in this thread really have no idea how China works.\n\nThey already have many lists, this is just another.

aS'The problem is that the vast majority of people posting in this thread have never been to mainland China.\n\nIn mainland China, people don\'t queue in line.  Especially outside of the major cities like Shanghai and Beijing.  Instead, people crowd around the booth, and push their way to the front.  It seems generally tolerated, and the people that were there first don\'t seem to be overly upset when other people push in front of them.  I don\'t know why.  To anyone in the world that isn\'t mainland Chinese, it\'s VERY confusing behavior.\n\nIn mainland China, drivers ignore the rules of the road, and don\'t yield right of way to pedestrians.  When you are crossing the street and the flashing green walking man sign is ahead of you, it means almost nothing.  Cars could come from any direction, and they won\'t stop if you\'re in the way.  They expect YOU to yield to them.  Chinese law states that cars must yield to pedestrians in such situations, but none of the drivers follow this.\nIf there is a traffic jam, mainland Chinese drivers will drive on the wrong side of the road, and honk in ANGER at the cars that are on the correct side.  It\'s maddening.  They will drive on the sidewalk, and scream in frustration at the pedestrians that are walking there, in their way.\n\nIn mainland China, people will simply push you if you are standing where they want to be.  A big hard push.  This is when trying to get on a bus, a subway, or if you wave down a taxi and are about to get in.  They will just push you out of the way.\n\nIn mainland China, people speak to each other at a volume approximately 10 times louder than anywhere else in the world.  There is no consideration about the people around them.  They will SCREAM into their cell phone while sitting on a bus surrounded by other people.\n\nIt\'s not that these behaviors are not considered rude in mainland China.  Such behavior is rude ANYWHERE.  The problem is that in mainland China rude behavior as outlined above is simply more tolerated than... well... anywhere else in the world.  People just deal with it, and then adapt an "if you can\'t beat them, join them" rationale.  Even when foreigners (who would otherwise behave normally) arrive in China, they immediately adapt to the new rude realities that is mainland China.\n\nThese are the FACTS about how mainland Chinese people behave in mainland China.  So when these people travel to other countries, they behave the only way they   know how to.  They push.  They speak FAR too loudly.  They don\'t queue in line.  They drive recklessly. \n\nIt\'s not "a few bad apples".  It\'s literally how mainland Chinese people behave, even in their own country.'

aS"So before Mao, farm peasants only used toilets with running water and a closed sewage system?\n\nIt's simply that China was already underdeveloped for its time when it went into the Authoritarian freeze it just recently emerged from. Hell, not too long ago American cities were equally and even more disgusting. I have a feeling America is going to be shocked at just how quickly China evolves and ends up taking over from the USA. China is not finicky about taking large scale measures to change and adapt and evolve, but we're talking about a cultural evolution at a pace I don't think humanity has ever witnessed before. "

aS'Nope, I\'m living in Japan and have been just as long as you have, have also lived in other parts of Asia including China to know enough of the similarities and differences between all of them, also lived in Australia for over 10 years to have seen all kinds of tourists come and go.  Nearly all the Asian tourists that visit Australia are called "Nip", which is actually a derogatory term for "Nippon" when the Japanese tried to invade Australia and even bombed Darwin.\n\nJapan had at least 10-15 years head start on China in terms of economic growth and development, but they\'re still terribly backward even today with China already overtaking them as the second largest economy in the world and fast catching up on the US.  China is a huge country where only 10-15% of it was responsible for its financial success, it will take the rest of the country of mostly farmlands to catch up economically, socially and culturally.  I lived in both city and countryside areas of China and I had no problem fitting in either places.  In fact, I lived like a king in China whereas in Japan I overpay to live in a shitty shoebox.\n\nIn Japan, they still insist on using squat toilets everywhere including schools and most public places that I wouldn\'t dare use if my life depends on it.  I absolutely dread using squat toilets so I was apprehensive about going to China, but as it turned out it was no problem whatsoever, just as long as I was not going to a remote old town that hasn\'t been upgraded yet (which they probably have by now).  Never had to face a squat toilet if I could help it, never saw anyone piss or shit on the street, but that\'s not to say that it will never happen.  With over 1 billion people living there, there\'s bound to be a few headcase.  I just happen to see more in Japan for some reason.\n\nYou can still find plenty of old, sad, shitty looking buildings in Japan that will never get upgraded, with the same squat toilets, cardboard walls and shitty insulation.  You kind of expect a global superpower to not have these problems but it\'s Japan, completely ingrained with it\'s own thinking.  Also, mental illness is a big problem in Japan, that might explain why some old dudes just do the things they do.\n\nOn the subject of technology, 10 years ago in China it was easy to get a SIM card, a mobile, internet at home, credit card etc.  In Japan, it was like pulling teeth where service was slow, cumbersome and still expensive for no reason.  \n\nAnd last but not least, the Japanese are the most difficult to be friends with and probably the least sincere, while the Chinese are the easiest and the most sincere.  Japan also has a reputation for being quite racists/elitists also for no reason other than...it\'s Japan.\n\nYou are deluding yourself if you think Japan is all beds and roses, it is not.'

aS'My experience was that during our tour of three cities in mainland China, our tour guide felt like he was being watched everywhere except on our actual bus. Every time we were out with him at a national site, we had to be careful that our behavior didn\'t reflect poorly on him. We saw him get "pulled over" by an official one time. I think he got points either added or deducted from his tour guide license (whichever was negative) for something one of us did. If we did anything wrong, trust me, it wasn\'t intentional and it wasn\'t something that would have been noticed in any other country. Most of us were well educated and had traveled internationally before. \n\nThe most egregious thing my friend did was to take photos of a woman being arrested in Tien An Men square. A police informer started shouting and pointing at my friend. The police came over and forced her to erase the photos. The same little snitch said another woman videoed it. She did not. The camera was brand new and she couldn\'t figure out how to play it back for the police to prove it. They eventually let all of us go. \n\nBut our guide was stopped at Xian as well and we never knew why. None of us did anything disrespectful. In fact, before we got off the bus in Tien An Men, he had a frank discussion with us about the tank and warned us not to talk about it openly while in the square. He answered all our questions about it before we got off the bus so we wouldn\'t get in trouble.\n\nEdit: This was in March 2007. We were there the day they revealed the design of the 2008 Olympic medals.'

aS'American here, how is "everyone is doing it" not an accurate mentality? Do you really believe that all aggression is somehow the United State\'s fault? Russia invaded Georgia a few years ago and is now in Ukraine, China\'s military spending grows double digits every year as it antagonizes Japan and openly admits it will take Taiwan, a democratic country, by force if necessary. North Korea continues to develop its nuclear weapons program. Conflict rages in the Middle East and Africa. The list goes on, and many of these things are happening with or without the United States. I\'m not going to say the US is perfect and we don\'t have our faults, we certainly do. But to claim that this is uniquely an American problem and that we are the source of all other conflicts is ridiculous. If a country like Russia or China was the world\'s dominant military power you would have a lot more to complain about, assuming an open forum like Reddit would even be allowed to exist for you to post your complaints.'

Why do you think NK behaves the way it does? What is the purpose of the country? Do you honestly think it\'s a natural situation brought about by insane leaders in the country like US media tells you?\n\n&gt;Conflict rages in the Middle East and Africa. \n\nYup.\n\nI wonder why.\n\nOh, [that\'s right...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game)    \n\n&gt;The list goes on, and many of these things are happening with or without the United States. \n\nNo, literally every single thing you just mentioned is a consequence of US geostrategic behaviour. Most of them a direct one.   \n\n\n&gt;I\'m not going to say the US is perfect and we don\'t have our faults, we certainly do. \n\nYes. You do.\n\n&gt; But to claim that this is uniquely an American problem and that we are the source of all other conflicts is ridiculous. \n\nWho said it\'s "unique"?\n\nThe point is that the US is the absolute worst and most other countries engaging in similar behaviour only engage in it because of the US.\n\nLots of other countries try and minimize conflict. And that includes China, a country not relying on war to fuel its economy. A nation that understands that there is a lot more money and power in collaboration and economic competition. \n\n&gt;If a country like Russia or China was the world\'s dominant military power, I think you would have a lot more to complain about, assuming they wouldn\'t censor you.\n\nI really doubt that. \n\nThe US is such a terrible nation because it is designed as such.\n\nThe corporate capitalist oligarchy ruling the US and the establishment of a permanent war economy make the success of the US incredibly unsustainable and also reliant on perpetual warfare. No other country does that. China\'s rule would be a lot more sustainable and peaceful. China also *will* eventually rule except the US starts a world war and its rule will most likely be marked by total economic and diplomatic domination and the eventual establishment of socialist approaches to economy, not military rule and unsustainable corporate capitalism. \n\nRussia... I don\'t think Russia in its current state will ever rule anything but itself. I think Russia is culturally dead and won\'t ever be in a position to become a significant threat again. I don\'t know how the CCCP would have ruled and I really don\'t have to care about that either.'

China's human rights records needs work as does their economic transparency.  I could also do with seeing their government be more free but the Chinese people seem to like it so ok.  America has it's own issues as well of course.  In the end though I think Russia is a dog that needs a master as it seems otherwise it can't help but nip at little dogs while barking at the much bigger dogs.  So let China be their master, which is what will happen with Russia selling their money and resources to China.  China seems to be a good counter-balance to the US, and a better one then Russia ever was.\n\nThe worst part is that two years ago I was so happy with Russia's want to work with the world.

Kind of similar to how the US has different regions and different stereotypes associated with the people from that general area.\n\nPerhaps I'm just not as aware of certain things as I simply didn't pay enough attention while traveling in the mainland to notice differences in culture and social norms, perhaps because I felt I wasn't in a foreign location and that everything is 'just the same'.

They are taking advantage by buying up one of the few precious things you can\'t replace, your own mineral resources.  They are doing the same thing in Africa.

Just because they hate us doesn't mean they'll suddenly begin to support the Russians who are even more backward. Same for the Chinese. Again, I don't see any weapons being flexed by any one except the U.S. in the Middle East. Why the hell would China want to go to war with us? We can just take away all their industry so I don't see any martial action or jingoism going down over SA and CA any time soon. Again, are there 'spheres' still? Well yeah in areas close to major powers. But they don't work the way they did in 1870. When Napoleon III invaded Lombardy for Sardinia Piedmont it was to restore glory to France and keep Sardinia close to France diplomatically. No one does that anymore. If Brazil and Argentina went to war there would be close eyes on the action but for what? What resources do they have that we don't and we couldn't just trade? And I don't see my chinese expansion problem answered, why don't we focus on that instead of taking advantage of nations who are poor? Why are they poor? Because they don't have any economic value. You're assuming the entire SA has resources like crazy and we need to gobble them up before the evil chinese do while the Chinese have yet to impose their influence on neighboring Vietnam. The spheres are always there for economical use and nothing more. Grandiose wars are over, and if one happens to break out it will be more than the destruction of just one nation.

aS'I don\'t know who\'s giving this gold and upvotes, but for those who don\'t closely follow history, you need to realize that pretty much all of the above is propaganda.\n\nThe sad fact of Latin America is that it has seen a long series of violent coups that put authoritarian regimes in power.  But to hear some people tell it, whenever the government changes power to a U.S.-friendly government, it\'s "the CIA", but whenever it changes to a leftist government, it\'s "the people".  That\'s propaganda.  In nearly every case, coups were almost entirely internal affairs that outside governments had little or no involvement in.\n\nOnce you starting looking past the propaganda and closer at the details, you can see that more clearly.\n\n&gt; 1963 Dominican Republic - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Juan Bosch in a military coup. The CIA installs a repressive, right-wing junta. (not democratically elected)\n\n&gt; 1965 Dominican Republic- A popular rebellion breaks out, promising to reinstall Juan Bosch as the country\'s elected leader. The revolution is crushed when U.S. Marines land to uphold the military regime by force. The CIA directs everything behind the scenes. Openly protect facist dictator that they had put in power AGAINST the wishes of the people.\n\nSo, when a revolt throws a leftist government out of power, it\'s "the CIA"; when a revolt tries to install a leftist government, it\'s "the people"?  Nonsense.\n\nThe facts are rather inconvenient for the leftists here.  The revolt that took Bosch out of power was an internal revolt led by the military.  Bosch was voted into power in an election, but his policies were deeply unpopular, and the military threw him out after less than a year ([Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Bosch#Coup_d.27.C3.A9tat)). Another military coup friendly to Bosch followed, and after a civil war ensued, the U.S. intervened in order to restore stability.  The country held free elections in which Bosch ran again and was defeated.\n\nIf all you read was the propaganda above, you\'d conclude that the U.S. didn\'t want a democratically elected President in power and threw him out.  The facts don\'t support that conclusion.  Not only did the U.S. not throw Bosch out of power, they intervened to impose democratic elections where he was allowed to run as a candidate.\n\n&gt; 2002 Venezuela - The CIA attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government of Venezuela. America attempted to put Millitary dictators in power, however, the coup soon unravels when thousands of anti-coup protesters surround the presidential palace demanding Hugo Chavez\'s reinstatement.\n\nAh yes, once again, when anybody attempts to remove a leftist government *of course* it\'s "the CIA", but when anybody imposes leftist policies on the country, it\'s with the will of "the people".  Well, "the people" have won in Venezuela - and now they will enjoy the results of the leftist policies the champions of "the people" have put in place.\n\n&gt; Most dictators in the world are in power because America. Africa and Asia is full of brutal dictators that are in power because America gave them guns and help.\n\nIf you want to know who\'s taken the most interest in a region, just look at where they get their armaments from.  If the U.S. has been there, it\'s M16s; if the Soviet Union and Communist China have been there, it\'s AK-47s.  I leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine whether African and Asia are thick with M16s or swimming in a sea of AK-47s.

aS"&gt;Nuclear&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;diesel\n\nNot so cut and dry. Nuclear submarines are faster and have longer operating range but diesel are significantly quieter. Which type of submarine a military would choose to use is based on its objectives. The US military, especially faced with the logistics challenges of operating in the Pacific (or the SW China Sea, half a planet away) needs that speed and endurance. A smaller, less offensively oriented navy, eg China, or one that doesn't intend to operate at great distances, again, like China, would be more interested in Subs for their AA/AD roles, for which quieter diesel subs are more effective."

aS'I grow very frustrated with the "population" excuse.\nSure, China has a crazy amount of people as a country... but even in Chinese cities of 1-2 million with typical population density... the precise same problems still exist.  In fact, I\'ve experienced that the problems are WORSE in the smaller cities.  Most of those people have probably never/rarely left the city.  So what does Chinas population as a whole have to do with the terrible behavior in that one city?\n\nI\'ve also traveled to dozens of cities worldwide with populations between 10-20 million.  And it\'s mainland Chinese cities where people behave the worse. So why do high population densities affect mainland Chinese people so much worse than anywhere else?\n\nWhen it comes to queuing, why does the "orderly way" work so well in Tokyo?  A city of 36 million?  Nobody would DARE push to the front in Tokyo.  A city of 36 million.  Yet in a town of less than a million in China, everyone will still push to the front.  \n\nAnd I love your excuse for drivers not yielding to pedestrians.

They don\'t know any better.\nThe "nice, polite" Chinese they\'ve seen travelling aren\'t mainlanders.

We saw a kid being held up to pee in a potted (indoor) plant once. We also witnessed a few hit-and-runs but people seemed mostly okay (one of my classmates had to go home though :( he got an infection). And I can understand squatting on (western) toilet seats if that\'s the only way someone has known how to go their whole life.\n\nI guess the takeaway is that most of the time people see rude Chinese tourists it\'s because many of them actually don\'t know any better/different culturally...

aS"&gt; China wants the minerals and oil either in the area or to maintain a safe way to move those resources. \n\nYes, every big country wants additional resources from around the world.  China doesn't own land in Israel (except the few companies they recently purchased); China certainly doesn't own any Palestinian land (illegal under their law for foreigners to own anything).\n\nThe point here is that everyone wants to come into the Israel/Palestinian/Arab conflict with their giant spoon and mess with the gumbo;  **but they aren't going to eat it!**\n\nToo many cooks and none of them have to eat the final product.  That's the problem.\n\n&gt; If you see your neighbor beating his kids say something, that guy is living his life how he wants.\n\nWhat?

I know that my tone can come off as a bit pedantic or angry; this isn\'t on purpose, simply my way to cut to the heart of the matter.\n\n&gt; Thats not even happening right now. How could another country oppress through peaceful resolution? And again either Israel or Palestine can decline Chinas potential future offer of help in this situation. You make it sound like China has a gun to Israels head. \n\nChina has security council status in the UN and carry weight in the international community, similar to Russia/USA/France.  From that position, they can influence the Middle-East, like Russia has by supplying weapons to everyone and anyone who wants it there.\n\nYou seem to think that countries only "negotiate" with one another, but the reality is that there\'s trade deals, weapon/technology exchanges, and support for opposition within a country by foreign nationals.\n\nI question China\'s ability to bring about "peace", as they have no vested interest in peace, only resource extraction.\n\n&gt; Theres lots of fucked up shit going on in the world right now to say that you cant want an end to the fighting in Israel and Palestine before tackling every other greater problem is a bit of a deflection. \n\nNo, it\'s not a "deflection", what it is a **worldwide distraction** from problems at home, by focusing on strangers abroad.  You\'ve heard the saying that "people in glass houses shouldn\'t throw stones".  Well, the reality of news and people is that they *want to* throw stones to *feel better* about the mess in their own house.  Israel acts as that worldwide political distraction from problems at home.\n\nThe truth is that we as a humans are mortal and have limited resources.  We can only focus our attention to one thing at a time.  If I\'m talking about Israel, that\'s time that I\'m not talking about Sudan or Syria.  We\'re not gods, we cannot do everything at once.\n\nTo focus on a foreign problem, that we do not have a vested interest in, is a distraction.  It\'s trying to tell others to clean their home, while ignoring our own.\n\n&gt; Again respectfully not trying to anger you but Israel and Palestine have had plenty of time to resolve and the longer it goes on the more and more we see that they are unable to bring the fighting to an end.\n\nSo has [India and Pakistan over Kashmir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict), but they still haven\'t resolved it.  Yet, for some reason, you\'re not talking about intervening there... Hmmm... wonder why?\n\n&gt; Both Israel and Palestine receive shit tons of money from the international community\n\nSo you think you **purchased Israel\'s sovereignty with foreign aid?**  Is that what you\'re saying, that a few billion dollars in assistance suddenly nulls a country\'s sovereign democracy?\n\nThink about what you\'re saying; American colonial capitalist mentality over running the world with money?\n\n&gt; Israel is a big trading partner for America and in this case China any country that does large amount of trading has a vested interest in keeping their trading partners stable and safe. \n\nTrading partner is one thing, you\'re infantalized country that you feel you can do what you want with is another.  Try respecting the only Jewish country on the planet, instead of pretending that they don\'t have the same rights to their land and what to do with it as any other country on the planet.\n\n&gt; I honestly dont see what the big deal is if peace is possible. \n\nIt\'s not, that\'s the problem.  The [Palestinians have clearly rejected peace](http://www.timesofisrael.com/tv-report-abbas-said-no-to-obama-on-3-core-peace-issues/) on numerous occasions and to pretend that peace is on the horizon is a lie.  Adding another cook to stew this pot will only make it worse, like I said.\n\n&gt; Israel is almost literally stuck between a rock and an Islamic place, their neighbors arent the biggest fans. Wouldnt it be great to get peace and Israelis wont have to worry about the surrounding countries trying to destroy them? Security feels nice. \n\nDid you just inject heroine into your blood?  You\'re talking fantasy, as though talking about it will make it into reality.  That only works when you\'re on drugs.\n\n&gt; I have a vested interest in peace. Do you? I dont actually have a TV.... so I dont watch shows like that. \n\nNo, you don\'t live in Israel or Palestine.  You don\'t have a vested interest in *their peace* because if war breaks out, it wont be your life or the life of your family in trouble.  Try understanding what you\'re role in this world is, instead of thinking everyone can do everything.\n\n&gt; I completely agree. Im a patron and I dont mind telling the cook what he is serving tastes like shit. \n\nGreat, now realize that the restaurant is in the Middle-East and the cook doesn\'t really want you to tell him anything, since you don\'t eat there regularly, pay taxes to the country, or even know the cook\'s name.\n\n&gt; Oh and I should mention that the mother is Israeli and I went a few times when I was much younger\n\nGood for you, glad you know what it looks like.  You\'re still not a tax paying citizen who has to deal with terrorism daily or with the consequences of another failed "peace plan" that only ends in Intifada. So, while I appreciate your insight, it feels a bit detached from the reality on the ground.\n\nHave a great day too!'

Freaking out about NATO with China on your border is like freaking out about your neighbor's pit bull when you have a tiger in your backyard.\n\nKeep in mind I think  any fear of Russia being invaded is irrational, but I would consider a Chinese invasion of Russia substantially more likely then a NATO one."

The area being in dispute right now have allowed Chinese vessels to continue their operations unmolested for the most part and the US Navy from direct intervention or "freedom of navigation" patrols right on top of China\'s maritime arteries.\n\nA easy way to bring down tensions in the area would be if the US stay out of the dispute and let it resolve itself just like the 17 disputes China generously settled without any foreign intervention.

aS"&gt; 1. Salafism isn't as simple as most redditors think it is. Salafist Jihadism is the problem here not salafism. \n\nThe ideology at its heart is radical. Wahhabism is inherently a radical ideology. Iranian Twelverism is bad too, btw, but in a much less destructive way (to other peoples) than Wahhabism. Wahhabism inherently breeds intolerance and the desire to purify the Umma. There is a reason why you constantly have fanatical Jihadists emerging from Wahhabism, from the Ikhiwan movement early on in the 19th century, to al Qaeda, to the Taliban, to Al Shabab, to Islamic State. Saying that Salafism isn't the problem is wrong because Salafism is the fuel for Jihadis to emerge. \n\n&gt; 2. Saudi Arabia does not fund or support Alqaeda or ISIS. Saying something like that is circle jerking and proof you don't know fuck all about the situation in the middle east. \n\nThen perhaps read my comment again. I was very careful to say 'by extension' and 'indirectly'. No they didn't support Al Qaeda directly, but they spend billions of petrodollars yearly pushing the blood drenched march of Wahhabism around the globe. This is how you got the same type of fundamentalist ideology sprouting up everywhere. Al Qaeda is nothing more than a branch of Wahhabism which pointed out that if Wahhabism is preaching about erasing impurity and corruption and about the corruptive influence of infidels and apostates then why does Saudi Arabia partner with the greatest  infidel power, the USA? Al Qaeda then split with the Wahhabi establishment over this issue of hypocrisy. The Wahhabi establishment has no real response to Al Qaeda, but they aren't willing to end their cooperation with the USA due to their personal greed. \n\nSimilarly with the Taliban, Saudi Arabia supported them all through the Taliban's reign of terror over Afghanistan, until the Taliban started to fight the west, then they split. But at its heart there is nothing distinguishing Saudi and Taliban ideology. It's just that Saudi is hypocritical on this one issue (relations with the USA). \n\nThis is why the greatest amount of support for these terrorist groups still comes from the Gulf, it just doesn't come from the state, it comes from the radical society which has been radicalized by the Saudi state which has showered billions of dollars on the Wahhabi establishment which controls education.\n\n&gt; Iran openly funds and supports Hezbollah, and allegedly supports the Houthis, and many Shia militias, yet saudi seems to love terrorists. \n\nHouthis are in no sense terrorists. This is hilarious, you have AQAP operating in Yemen, a real terrorist group which blows up Shia mosques and busy market places and focuses on blowing up western targets, but the group you call terrorists are the Houthis, a group which has Sunni members and which does not target civilians. Jesus, this is unbelievable. You are just calling them terrorists because that who your buddy Saudi Arabia decided to start bombing rather than AQAP. \n\nHezbollah has used terrorism against Israel, which sucks, but in a completely different way than Wahhabi Jihadism sucks. Hezbollah is a nationalist group, and non-sectarian, friendly with Christians and other minorities. They don't threaten anyone other than Israel, and they haven't even attacked Israel offensively for about a decade. From the perspective of the USA this isn't even remotely as problematic as a group like Al Qaeda, ISIS, Taliban, etc which exterminate minorities and target westerners. One ideology is infinitely more toxic than the other from our perspective in the USA.\n\n&gt; 4. The comment was right, iran has executed way more than saudi already this year,  but it gets less stick. There's no reason for that but a biased attitude here. It's fun to hate on Arabs in this subreddit and love anything that isn't arab, like kurds or Persians.\n\nFirst off the whole numbers of executions are a bit skewed because Saudi Arabia has a tiny population compared to Iran. Similarly China has way more executions than Iran, but that doesn't mean that it's worse than Iran.\n\n\nSecondly, number of executions isn't at all the reason why someone might think that one country is more harmful than another. I don't see how Iran executing dozens of drug dealers should be relevant to relations with them. You want to look at the international influence of that country. And Saudi Arabia has a terrible influence. It spreads the hateful ideology which gives birth to international terrorism around the world. It actively supports dreadful groups like those in the Islamic Front in Syria who slaughter Christian and Shia civilians. You can tell the morality if Saudi state by how when it looks at AQAP and the Houthis, it decides to launch an air campaign against the Houthis. It's insanity. "

There is a huge difference between freedom of navigation and threatening blockade, and they are on virtual opposite sections of military signaling and escalation. The ocean is huge and freedom of navigation in proximity to exclusive economic zones is not that escalatory, China does this to many countries in the region. If the U.S. was aiming to threaten a blockade, these ships would be near the Straits of Malacca. These patrols are clearly for the sake of influencing the territorial disputes, believing they are also about a blockade is a false assumption. Simply putting out articles that discuss a blockade also doesn\'t prove that it is U.S. policy, it only proves that there are people who have written about it. The U.S. doesn\'t even take sides in most territorial disputes that involve some of its oldest allies in the region, threatening to blockade China would be a suicidal ploy unless in the context of an already severe crisis or outbreak of war.

aS'Palestinians don\'t really recognize the sovereignty of the nation of Israel in the philosophically typical Western way.  National borders matter far less than traditional lands of families and tribes. Furthermore, it\'s not like the Israeli nation took these lands by force in some kind of war.  Britain and the US essentially created the country after WW2 in compensation to the Jewish people who had lost so much after the Holocaust and wanted a Zion, a place to call their own.\n\nIt\'s easy to understand, then, why Palestinians living in Israel is \'no big deal\'.  Western values (particularly those of the UK and US) include freedom of speech and religion, the ability to be whoever you want without fear of persecution. This is reflected in the Israeli Constitution, a document which had a lot of US/UK influence in its drafting.\n\nThat\'s also where you run into the \'Zionist\' problem. There are members of the Jewish community who believe the land of Israel was ordained by God for them.  The Torah proclaims the Jews as the \'Chosen People\', after all.  So it\'s no issue to those groups to continue moving into Palestinian territories, because God has given the region to them.\n\nExcept that, for Palestinians, *none* of that land belongs to them.  Israel has existed fewer than a hundred years. The Palestinians\' families and ancestors have lived in that region for several hundred (closer to several thousand) years. They just see white men from the UK and US saying "this land belongs to Israel now" like it\'s truth, and they don\'t recognize nor respect it.  It\'s like when you were a kid; if your brother comes into your room, takes a toy and says "this is mine now", that doesn\'t make it his.  That makes it stolen.\n\nIt\'s easy for us in the US to say "just live with it, Israel\'s not going anywhere", but imagine China taking over the US and imposing its way of life over us. You think we\'d be over that in 75 years? or 100? How long would it take before the hatchet gets buried?'

Saying that Salafism isn\'t the problem is wrong because Salafism is the fuel for Jihadis to emerge.\n\nWhat are the radical elements of salafism? You are throwing words here that most people in this thread, like you really, do not understand, its a generalisation of subsect, equal to saying catholics are at their hearts violent due to the crusades. Salafist Jihadism is the ideologys more violent offshoot, a more political salafism. Salafism is conservative, yes, but its no more conservative than a some Christian or Buddhist ideologies.  \n\nPurify the Ummah? Doesnt every subsect or sect believe it is the pure form? Salafism didnt even start with Muhammed Ibn Abdulwahib, where the term Wahhabism originated from, its ideals were formed by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, known among Salafis as Imam Ahl al-Sunnah and the three scholars commonly titled with the honorific Sheikh ul-Islam, namely, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim. The Ikhiwan are nothing but a 19th century militia group of early salafist jihadism. \n\nThe point is, you are generalising a demonising salafism, as if it was that simple. I recommend you read the actual teaching of salafism, and the differences between salafists themselves. All you mentioned are salafsit jihadists, who mix their salafism with political ideologies, and jihadism. They arent anything special. And the Taliban, arent salafist theyre Deobandi Sunnis. Now what we can agree on right now is, Islamism in general, is toxic.\n\n&gt; Then perhaps read my comment again. I was very careful to say \'by extension\' and \'indirectly\'. No they didn\'t support Al Qaeda directly, but they spend billions of petrodollars yearly pushing the blood drenched march of Wahhabism around the globe.

Al Qaeda then split with the Wahhabi establishment over this issue of hypocrisy. The Wahhabi establishment has no real response to Al Qaeda, but they aren\'t willing to end their cooperation with the USA due to their personal greed.\n\nThey spend money exerting influence and spreading salafism? Nothing any other country hasnt done with its own ideologies be it religion or political. Saudi spreads Islam as any Christian missionary group in Africa and Asia does. Its bit hypocritical to hold them to account for this. Saudi is not being hypocritical, salafist dont believe you must be the enemy with the infidel. Again youre mixing salafist jihadism with the normal millions of salafis you are condemning. Al Qaeda split for their own political purposes, and their own offshoot of salafism. This isnt hypocrisy, I dont see the argument at all. They believe in different things, no one is being hypocritical. \n\nTaliban support? Didnt the US do the exact same thing? Saudi supported the Taliban against the soviets, it was to push up soviet influence in the greater middle east. Again not the same Ideology. Your statements echo the many misconceptions and idiotic statements I see on reddit daily.\n\nThis is why the greatest amount of support for these terrorist groups still comes from the Gulf, it just doesn\'t come from the state, it comes from the radical society which has been radicalized by the Saudi state which has showered billions of dollars on the Wahhabi establishment which controls education.\n\nThe gulf is radical? Havent seen Dubai yet have you. ;), Again youre generalising a lot and its kind of sad now. The state doesnt control education as much, its delegated to religious clergy, who define and change the curriculum on a yearly basis, Saudi Arabia has also changed its schooling system in the past 5 years, as its not solely influenced by the state only rather than clergy.\n\n&gt;Houthis are in no sense terrorists. This is hilarious, you have AQAP operating in Yemen, a real terrorist group which blows up Shia mosques and busy market places and focuses on blowing up western targets, but the group you call terrorists are the Houthis, a group which has Sunni members and which does not target civilians. Jesus, this is unbelievable. You are just calling them terrorists because that who your buddy Saudi Arabia decided to start bombing rather than AQAP.\nHezbollah has used terrorism against Israel, which sucks, but in a completely different way than Wahhabi Jihadism sucks.\n\nWow, I guess its terrorism when western targets are the priority. Houthis are totally innocent, I guess them holding their banners with "God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam" is totally freedom fighting material. They seek to overthrow the government and install a shia led one. (Although as you can see the population is mostly Sunni) Houthis arent as innocent as you love to portray it. And Iran isnt as progressive as you love to portray aswell. No one is targeting civilians, but houthis are targeting everyone who they perceive is a threat ofcourse.\nYour argument is actually funny, the Syrian rebels are made up of some salafis and are anti-alqaeda and ISIS, yet they are terrorists too right?\n\nIn 2007 Houthis expelled Yemeni Jews from the Houthi stronghold of Al-Salem and again 2014, they were expelled from from the town of Raydah in the Amran governorate. The Houthis were bullying a small group of impoverished rural Jews in the name of their war against Israel and Zionism. "Cursed be the Jews" is a Houthi slogan. Houthis have been destroying Jewish homes, confiscating their proprty, forbidding them to work and expelling them. Stones are thrown at children in the street.\n\nPretty much false, Hezbollah is committed to targeting its sunni targets nowadays since the Syrian civil war, and yes they arent anti western but somehow that makes them good? Killing goals in general isnt good whatever the target.  \nI guess the 2012 Burgas bus bombing is past a decade right? And their plots to attack Egypt in 2009 too, and Rafic Hariri, lebanons president, was assassinated by Hezbollah too. Hezbollah fighting with Syrian Government against sunni rebels is also as justified as the Houthis now right?\n\nToxic or not, both POLITICAL ideologies are toxic. \n\n\n\n&gt;First off the whole numbers of executions are a bit skewed because Saudi Arabia has a tiny population compared to Iran. Similarly China has way more executions than Iran, but that doesn\'t mean that it\'s worse than Iran.\nSecondly, number of executions isn\'t at all the reason why someone might think that one country is more harmful than another.

You can tell the morality if Saudi state by how when it looks at AQAP and the Houthis, it decides to launch an air campaign against the Houthis. It\'s insanity.\n\n\nFirst off, that is what some people assume on Reddit, I was just making a statement that if Saudi is so bad for these executions, why isnt Iran. Im talking about the countries relating to executions, as its more condemned and gets a bigger uproar when Saudi does it but not Iran. (Lol at the drug dealers part, I dont see why Saudi executing drug dealers and murders is relevant to the relations with them). See my point? You came here to defend Iran but your biased attitude to them, just resonates lovely in your comments I love it. The lack of reading you do about the ideologies you condemn and even the countries you condemn and defend is LOVELY. \nYour whole last paragraph is pretty much insanity, AQAP didnt gain ground until the houthis emerged, giving AQAP time and less resistance to gain control in Yemen.\n\nSaudi supports the YEMENI government, who primarily trying to fight both AQAP and the Houthis, the houthis are a bigger threat and a stronger one than AQAP is in Yemen.

aS'Han migration to Tibet has scarcely changed the TAR\'s ethnic configuration.  The TAR is still 90% Tibetan, which is a decline of 3% over 50 years of Chinese rule.  Most of the migration is furthermore focused on the major cities, but Tibetan "traditional culture" is still largely pastoral and rural - Han migration to smaller villages and the like is virtually nonexistent.  \n\nWith respect to Xinjiang, again, Xinjiang is a Chinese construct.  The Uyghurs hail from the Southern part of Xinjiang while the Han have migrated to the North.  Southern Xinjiang is only geographically important as a connection to Tibet (the disputed Aksai Chin territory being a linchpin for the Xinjiang-TAR highway), but the strategically valuable cities and routes flow through Northern Xinjiang, which was never the "Muslim Territory" (I believe the Dzungars were Buddhists).  \n\nAlso, the restrictions (or, in your words, oppression) against Uyghurs has only been relatively recent.  This comes in light of last year\'s death statistics, where nearly 500 civilians were murdered by Uyghur separatists.  It\'s hard to find sympathy for their plight when you have mass stabbings in train stations, bombs in crowded marketplaces in the early morning, and attempted hijackings of planes.  \n\nIn the mean time, it\'s not like China has been completely unsympathetic to Uyghurs.  Most restrictions such as the One Child Policy do not apply to minorities.  They also get preferential treatment in government positions and university admissions.  The vast majority of Uyghurs have found this to be acceptable. '

America gets away with it because it is the mighty superpower.\n\nChina dominates and occupies a considerable amount of land that has either never been Chinese or has people there that do not want to live under Chinese rule (see Uighurs, Tibetans, Western half of China). China's influence is extending into waters that are not theirs as they ram Vietnamese boats and fish on coral reefs. China gets away with it because everyone wants their money.\n\nEngland...well, let's not pretend that England got where it is today just through stiff upper lips. There was a period of the largest empire in the world. Now they occupy North Ireland and Scotland wanted to split away from 'em. England sort of gets away with it but is less influential than either China or America.\n\nRussia just attacked Crimea and Ukraine. Let's repeat that: **Russia attacked Crimea and Ukraine.** Siberia wasn't even Russian until the Russian Empire decided 'hey, see that big land filled with Mongols, Turks, and Siberians? Yeah, ours now'. Russia is a warlike nation run by criminals; we all expect this.\n\nThere is a border dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both screaming about land being taken from the other. No one cares.\n\nSyria is in a state where nobody knows who's occupying what because everyone's killing and murdering each other. No one cares, typical Muslims.\n\nNorth Korea? Yeah, North Korea, again, nobody cares, UN doesn't care to make a big deal about it because North Korea is dangerous.\n\nIn fact I'd say a great deal of Europe has benefited enormously from their colonial histories. Moreover European nations were the ones that almost completely destroyed us Jews in the first place, something that took place over two thousand years. Why the hell should we care what Europe has to say? They benefited from stealing Jewish property, slaughtered them in droves, and now that Israel is involved in conflict (that they didn't even start) *now* it's wrong. *Now* the Europeans are shining beacons of human rights (lotta good it's doing them, see refugees pouring into Europe and increasing antisemitism) who protest a rather small, insignificant conflict in a small, not terribly important nation that is distinguished by the fact that it is Jewish. It is neither participating in genocide nor ethnic cleansing and yet people treat it as such. It gets *way* more attention than other far more barbaric countries and yet often categorized with the same visceral hatred.\n\nI strongly dispute the idea that Israel is even occupying anybody. The pulled out of Gaza, which was a huge mistake since the Gazans elected Hamas and started throwing rockets and suicide bombers at them, culminating in a giant wall that, surprise surprise, has cut them off from the rest of the world - Egypt seemed to think it was a great idea as well. The land that the Israelis 'occupied' was land that certain *extremely aggressive warlike people* **lost** when they **were beaten in warfare**.\n\nThe civilized world has benefited enormously from a history of aggression, warfare, colonialism, thievery, and brutality, and now that Israel seeks to act the same as any other nation state they are automatically branded as 'naughty people'. The Jew among nations who may strive but will never be like them in their eyes.\n\nAgain. Israel holds the cards. The West has always, always outnumbered and pushed down hard on the Jews, no matter what they did. Who cares what they say? Go Israel, defend yourself."

Tens of thousands of peaceful demonstrators were being gunned down in the streets on the orders of the US Military Government of the period in multiple uprising attempts. IIRC the final revolution came when the government went too far and killed a bunch of high-profile students, allowing South Korea to eventually become a democracy. \n\nNaturally no Hollywood movies have been made of this so everyone just assumes that the South has always been the more sane of the two. If anything the north\'s "invasion" of the south was fully justified; they literally were trying to kick out a foreign occupier who had partitioned their country as the spoils of WW2.\n\nSay China invaded North America and split Texas off into it\'s own country.

All three races exhibit almost the same kind of racism; it is okay to interact with foreigners, but not okay to marry them. This is especially true for Japanese and Koreans who even frown upon their daughters seeing non-Japanese or Koreans, even if you are not from China. There are very strong ethnocentrism in each country, each believing that they are really the better race to lead Asia. \n\nThe Chinese has a particularly strong superiority complex, much due to the last two centuries of humiliation from foreign powers (losing to English Empire was one thing, getting kicked in the ass by tiny Japan was just downright mortifying), the weakness of China and the glory of old imperial China. Hans always have very strong ethnocentrism, seeing that China basically dominated the entire east Asia for the last 3000 years or so. That's why Chinese and the CCP is so sensitive to criticism and any appearance of embarrassment or weakness.

The group trashed the ground floor of the Garden hotel where the consulate is located.\n\nPeople burned down cars and a few Japanese car shops but that's where it ended.\n\nRegarding the Japanese I think they simply stayed in for the time being, I didn't pay attention to what happened.\n\nMy compound, the more upscale compounds are all gated with their own security.

But they're still expansionist, and still trying to become the regional superpower, despite pretty poor relations with their neighbors (Mongolia excepted). Japan is wary of them, as are South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Singapore. The problem is, all of those countries together make up maybe 400 or 500 million people. They're ethnically diverse (though maybe not from our perspective), politically diverse, and have their own beef with each other. Everyone hates the Japanese almost as much as they hate the Chinese. The Japanese look down on pretty much everyone. So Chinese expansion is really destabilizing. Since we trade with everyone in that area, we really don't want anything escalating, and we really don't want the Chinese getting too big for their britches.\n\nSo the tl;dr is, they're like the friend who you have to keep an eye on because they start fights with all your other friends."

It will stay as a regional power, but not even a hegemon. China is rivaled militarily against Russia, and rivaled economically with Japan and South Korea.

They were doing fine.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/34wvkd/forget_tanks_its_russias_ruble_thats_conquering/cqyxtgi?context=3\n\n&gt;Check Russias GDP their not winning any wars.

Russia is a Non-Player-Character in the war of world wide finance.\n\nI once again don\'t know what post you read, but it certainly wasn\'t mine. "The easiest war you can wage is a financial war." Who is waging the war? Not Russia. The US. Read my other post about 2 inches down on your screen. I did anything but paste a rosy picture of Russia ATM. \n\n&gt;If Russia doesn\'t buckle from political/economic circumstances, give it a decade and the BRIC bank will be moving smoothly. \n\n&gt;The power Russia lost is hurting them extremely hard in the short-term.\n\n&gt;If it DOES pay off, Russia essentially falls, though.\n\nOn to the next. \n\n&gt;Check Russias GDP their not winning any wars. They have fallen behind India already, down to 10th place in the world, In fact, Russia is the smallest of the big four in BRIC.\n\n[True, but extremely misleading.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:RUS:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:RUS:GBR:CAN:CHN:USA:IND&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) Russia had experienced 4x GDP growth in 15 years with no signs of stopping - very similar to the US in the same time period. Prior to the sanctions/Ukrainian war [(You can check here)](http://knoema.com/nwnfkne/world-gdp-ranking-2015-data-and-charts), they were just BARELY surpassed by India. Sure it\'s a couple years of poor GDP, but that certainly hasn\'t impacted their *capability.* Here\'s the problem comparing Apples (Russia) to oranges (China/India). [For one, Russia is ALREADY FAIRLY INDUSTRIALIZED. AND Russia pretty much leads the non-Western world in GDP per capita.](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg). Russia-China trade is currently [booming,](http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2014/12/24/china-russia-trade-boom-2015.html) which is a positive sign of economic health. Meanwhile, China and India are still in the process of industrializing. Why is this relevant? It\'s used to calculate GDP. All new infrastructure is added to GPD. China\'s GDP is high because they\'re building this infrastructure - BUT RUSSIA ALREADY HAS IT! GDP from industrialization isn\'t sustainable - there\'s only so much you can build. To be fair, Russia\'s infrastructure lags far behind, has depreciated, but so does the US\'s (to a lesser extent). Regardless, you\'re comparing Russia to two very different economies in different stages of development. [The other huge factor is birth rate.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA:CHN:IND&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false). Russia has only recently picked up following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, China and India are prospering from DECADES of insane fucking. Moral of the story? Fuck a lot in a pre-industrialized country and your economy will grow. It should be interesting to see the difference in India vs. China in the coming years, because China put a stop to the intense fucking while India is still reproducing like rabbits. [India, the US, and China are flooded with 20-40 year old workers ATM.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Median_age.png/1280px-Median_age.png). Russia is aging like Europe. With low reproductive rates, that\'s significant negative points for Russia. BUT, don\'t ignore this fact either... "According to a 2008 World Bank statistic 54% of the Russian labor force has attained a tertiary (college) education, giving Russia the highest attainment of college-level education in the world." The US trails by almost 15%.\n\nOutlook wise? [In 2013, Russia was doing far better than India/Brazil when it comes to foreign investment.](http://www.ey.com/RU/En/Issues/Business-environment/EY-road-to-2030-russian-infrastructure-in-global-context) The sanctions change that, for obvious reasons, but the demand is still there. They only trail China by ~~12%.~~ 1.2% \n\n&gt;Russia doesn\'t even have enough financial reserves left to pay off the Fascist midgets criminal co-conspirators who are loosing their shirts right now.\n\nI don\'t disagree with that statement either. Putin has a hard fight, currently. Some of the oligarchs are loyalists, others are just businessmen. At the end of the day, there are plenty of trained marksman for sale and a leader with a target on his head who is the enemy of some of the richest, craziest motherfuckers in the world. Though I don\'t really see that happening either. \n\nUnless another round of sanctions hit it looks like the ruble is recovering. It\'ll probably only recover 50-60% of the lost value, but that\'s already foregone. Businessmen know this. Businessmen also happen to know that civil wars, assassinations, and major policy changes will hurt Russian morale. \n\nPeople underestimate Russia\'s capability because for the last 25 years they\'ve been recovering from the collapse of an empire aka glasnost. The US prospered following WW2 because they didn\'t claim land - they focused on Japan and Germany. Russia spread themselves too thin and tried to form too big of an empire quickly. But, underestimating your "enemy" is a huge, huge oversight. They still are an industrial machine. They\'re still the most matched and most willing military enemy of the US. Their military is fairly state of the art in that "If Russia goes to war, the US might have slightly better tech, but not enough to dominate," ignoring the nuke thing. [And if you doubt Russia\'s efficiency and competence, check out the Sukhoi T-50.](http://www.wired.com/2012/11/russia-stealth/) It\'s very comparable to the 1.5T F-22 at a cost of only 10B (Though that will surely go up with production and modifications). I\'d say they beat us there. Though, they do lag ~5-8 years behind the US so we\'d definitely have the edge - but I don\'t think anyone questions that. \n\n**TLDR; Hate Russia all you want, but their GDP per capita is the highest outside the Western World, their GDP grew at a similar rate to the US prior to sanctions, they have a decent - but aging - infrastructure, the ruble\'s freefall ended and is recovering, they\'re the most educated country in the world (by degree attainment), they\'re STILL recovering from glasnost, and their military tech is JUST BEHIND the US\'s at a much cheaper cost.** \n\nSorry if there are typos and bad transitions. It\'s 5AM here and I don\'t want to proof-read. Edit: also had to take a shit. \n\nEdit: also that completely looked at the good side of Russia in this comment. I could write a pretty long comment on the downsides too - such as worker productivity growth which is [shit in Russia](https://thereformedbroker.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/chopsticks.gif). '

The Vietnamese avoided mobilizing their regular divisions, and held back some 300,000 troops for the defence of Hanoi. The People\'s Army of Vietnam (VPA) tried to avoid direct combat and often used guerrilla tactics.\n\nThe initial PLA attack soon lost its momentum and a new attack wave was sent in with 8 PLA divisions joining the battle. After capturing the northern heights above Lang Son, the PLA surrounded and paused in front of the city in order to lure the VPA into reinforcing it with units from Cambodia. This had been the main strategic ploy in the Chinese war plan as Deng did not want to risk an escalation involving the Soviet Union. The VPA high command, after a tip-off from Soviet satellite intelligence, was able to see through the trap[citation needed], however, and committed reserves only to Hanoi.\n\nOnce this became clear to the PLA, the war was practically over. An assault was still mounted, but the Vietnamese only committed one VPA regiment defending the city.[citation needed] After three days of bloody house-to-house fighting, Lang Son fell on March 6. The PLA then took the southern heights above Lang Son[43] and occupied Sapa. The PLA claimed to have crushed several of the VPA regular units.[9]\n\nThe PLA now resumed their attacks aimed at the major provincial capitals and key communication centres in the border hinter land. Major battles developed at Cao Bng, Lang Son, Hoang Lien Son, Lai Chau and Quang Ninh. The aim of these attacks was to draw in the regular VPA formations and inflict heavy attrition on them through classical "meat-grinder" operations. There were fierce attacks and counterattacks; in Lang Son the Chinese launched 17 counterattacks to regain one objective.\n\nBy late last week of February, the Vietnamese had still not committed any of their regular divisions which were being held back for the defence of Hanoi. They had also not pulled out any of their 150,000 troops in Cambodia.\n\nOn March 6, China declared that the gate to Hanoi was open and that their punitive mission had been achieved. On the way back to the Chinese border, the PLA destroyed all local infrastructure and housing and looted all useful equipment and resources (including livestock), severely weakening the economy of Vietnam\'s northernmost provinces.[9] The PLA crossed the border back into China on March 16. Both sides declared victory with China claiming to have crushed the Vietnamese resistance and Vietnam claiming to have repelled the invasion using mostly border militias. Dr. Henry J. Kenny, a research scientist for CNA, points out that **most western writers agree Vietnam outperformed the PLA on the battlefield**'

aS'"1971 Bolivia - After half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President Juan Torres. In the next two years, dictator Hugo Banzer will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped and executed. (The dictator is not democratically elected either)"\n\n--Surprisingly this statement includes the word "leftist" being that the other posts purposely left out this angle to falsely give the narrative that the U.S. was involved only because it was being mean or just wanted to make money as you say. Again the people themselves rejected Torres and the CIA backed those opposition groups full on because Torres was in bed with the Soviets and the weapons involved in that violence came straight from the Soviet bloc.  "If in the wake of Vietnam I can no longer send in the Marines, then I will send in the CIA."Senator Frank Church, 1976\n\n"1963-65 Dominican Republic- A popular rebellion breaks out, promising to reinstall Juan Bosch as the country\'s elected leader. The revolution is crushed when U.S. Marines land to uphold the military regime by force. The CIA directs everything behind the scenes. Openly protect facist dictator that they had put in power AGAINST the wishes of the people."\n\n--Once again this statement purposely leaves out the conflict being centered on U.S. vs Communism and makes it seem like it was U.S. vs Dominican Republic. President Johnson sent in forces to prevent another Cuba situation.  Elas Wessin had stated: "The Communist doctrine, Marxist-Leninist, Castroite, or whatever it is called, is now outlawed." When forces loyal to the Soviet bloc, armed with Soviet supplied weapons, made headway the U.S. responded in kind. There is no way in anyone\'s imagination the U.S. would allow Soviet influence in this hemisphere to go unchallenged. The reason the Soviet angle is purposely left is to further the false narrative that the U.S. was simply acting to make money as you say. \n\n"1964 Brazil - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. Puts a millitary junta in power (Not democratically elected) and later it is revealed that the CIA trains the death squads of General Castelo Branco (who is one of the facist dictators US puts in power)."\n\n-- The people of Brazil and the military of Brazil overthrew their leader Joao Goulart because he began to socialize the economy. He gained power after Jnio Quadros resigned. Joao Goulart was in Communist China at the time and when he returned all three branches of the military tried to peacefully keep him from gaining power through a congressional avenue. A compromise was made that turned the government into parliamentary democracy that limited the power of the socialist leader. Afterwards he reinstated his powers and proceeded to make socialist reforms that upset the population and caused the military to revolt. Of course the U.S. backed the opposition groups because in the context of the cold war there is no way the U.S. was going to allow its enemy to gain a foothold in this hemisphere. Again this aspect was left out. \n\n"1961-63 Ecuador - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows President Arosemana, whose independent (not socialist) policies have become unacceptable to Washington. A military junta assumes command. (not democratically elected)"\n\n--President Arosemana was deposed by his own people after being accused of cozying up to Dictator Fidel Castro. Although he was not far left during the time of crisis he became a worthless alcoholic and even though he tried to make last minute concessions like breaking off ties with Cuba he was deposed by his military. Of course the U.S. backed the opposition.\n\n"1959 Haiti- The U.S. military helps "Papa Doc" Duvalier become dictator of Haiti. Not democratically elected"\n\n--Would you be shocked if once again communism was involved? The united States would have backed the devil himself if it meant keeping Soviet influence out of the western hemisphere. Haiti opposed Castro on the international level and Castro supported anti-Duvalier groups.  \n\n"1954 Guatemala - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Jacob Arbenz in a military coup. Arbenz is replaced with a series of facist dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years. Non of them are democratically elected."\n\n--Even the wikipedia page on the 1954 Guatemala [coup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) has the word "communist" listed over 40 times yet this statement blatantly leaves it out.\n\nHow is it that all of these examples leave out the context of the cold war? One of the few places the U.S. was unsuccessful in preventing a Soviet bloc leaning leadership from gaining power was in Cuba. The establishment of tactical nuclear warheads aimed at the United States is an indicator of the very high stakes in which this struggle entailed. The name "Soviet Union" simply doesn\'t carry the same weight with us modern reddit readers as it did during the cold war. When bringing the context back into the events it quickly washes away any notion that the U.S. acted the way it did simply because they "wanted to make money".  '

India's surface combat fleet is qualitatively superior thanks to access to Russian, Israeli, European and American technology.

In addition Indian Airforce training levels are much higher. They get more flying time than most NATO countries. Whereas the Chinese don't trust their pilots with a lot of flying time. (Even the Americans vouch for the training levels of the Indian Airforce)\r\rThe Indian Army is highly trained and had way more battle experience than the Chinese.

Because believe it or not, there is legal precedent in most cases for their legitimate control over those lands.  Now, it could be argued that China just barely operates within "legal" limits (and almost certainly against the spirit of international laws), but nevertheless, China usually does not outright violate international norms.\n\nIf you wish to know more, I\'d suggest looking into stances by various countries regarding these issues.  Look at the wording of those stances carefully.\n\nAlso, China did not try to annex Vietnam.  China had a defense treaty with Cambodia, which obligated them to come to Cambodia\'s defense when Vietnam attacked them in 1978 (although it could be argued that Cambodia begun the aggression).  Yes, I\'m simplifying the issue a bit, and most people on this sub won\'t go much further than "hur dur they fought a war and therefore they hate each other", but quite simply, the issue of the Sino-Vietnamese war went quite a bit further than Vietnam and China.  It had implications on the Soviets as well.  Although the Chinese offensive went rather badly, in terms of politics, they achieved everything they needed to do.  They humiliated the Soviets by coming to the aid of their allies while the Soviets hung back, not wishing to spark a war with China.  Even though they didn\'t actually manage to save Pol Pot in the end.\n\nBut yeah, it\'s a bit more complicated than "China want land, Vietnam gib" shit you see around here.'

aS'Thanks for your input. You hit the nail on the spot.\n\nReally, the entire area is so important not because of the resources (which is a nice bonus), or the land (the largest habitable island in the region is controlled by Taiwan and they have an EEZ as a result). It is the trade route that travels through the straits there.\n\nThe reason why China inherited the claim decades ago and is only now pressing to control facts on the ground today is because it had became their lifeline for vital commodities like oil and foodstuff. The same reason is what prompted China to invest in the "Maritime Silk Road" and an alternative port via Pakistan, the "One Belt One Road" railways/infrastructure investments through Central Asia and SE Asia, and the rail links with Russia. China is trying to protect itself from being easily starved via a blockade in the SCS, but they need time. As such, they will not take any concrete steps towards settling the dispute (or clarifying the vague U-shaped line like Taiwan did) until the alternative routes are properly set up.\n\nThe nine-dash claim was first known as the eleven-dash claim. The CCP removed two dashes as a favour to Vietnam, but now China sees security of this vital sea route as more important than their decades of "playing nice", and thus the new assertiveness. Obama of course is taking advantage of it to call China out, but of the ASEAN only Vietnam and Philippines have large stakes riding on the dispute. Malaysia for instance prefers better economic relations with China instead.'

The most likely scenario in all this is that Pakistan and India have a limited nuclear exchange followed by Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Pakistan has a shoot first nuke policy, the only one of its kind in the world.  The Saudis paid for their program and can license it out whenever they choose, which will happen when, not if, Iran goes nuclear.\n\nConventional warfare is very much off the table in the middle east.

China would not invade Taiwan though, because China expects sanctions afterwards.  Could China survive with trade inside Asia and Africa?  Could the West deal with a return to a mass manufacturing economy?  India (treated now as a younger non-threatening, China in terms of trade) would benefit greatly if China were to suffer sanctions.  Russia is in bad shape (.6% growth, GDP less than Italy) relative to their potential, but would also benefit as a half-resource half-service economy.\n\n \nTL/DR:  China invading Taiwan (what I consider the most possible China vs. West encounter) would force the U.S back into a manufacturing economy (very bad as manufacturing doesn't have the growth of a service/invest economy).

At least 130 people were detained or otherwise restricted to stifle criticism and prevent protests ahead of the leadership transition initiated at the18th Chinese CommunistParty Congress in November. Access to justice remained elusive for many, resulting in millions of people petitioning the government to complain of injustices and seek redress outside the formal legal system. Muslims, Buddhists and Christians, who practised their religion outside officially sanctioned channels, and Falun Gong practitioners, were tortured, harassed, arbitrarily detained, imprisoned and faced other serious restrictions on their right to freedom of religion. Local governments continued to rely on land sales to fund stimulus projects that resulted in the forced eviction of thousands of people from their homes or land throughout the country. The authorities reported that they would further tighten the judicial process in death penalty cases; however thousands were executed.\n\n...\n\nHere are some things that you cannot do in China: vote, start a newspaper, own a home, belong to a religion that doesn't have 'state approval,' choose where to live, freely travel to other countries, access a large chunk of the internet, determine the gender of your baby in utero, choose how many children to have."

aS"Oh, please don't misunderstand me. I absolutely agree that the US is a major perpetrator of human rights abuses. I'm only trying to say that the nature and scope of these abuses isn't as severe as China. Again, it's comparing apples and oranges but we could try to make analogies based on the type of abuse.\n\nGenocide/Democide:\n\nAs you pointed out, the US is reponsible for the near-extermination of native Americans, arguably tens of millions of deaths. China, particularly under Mao, is responsible for around 60 million deaths (varies based on the source) due to the hundred flowers campaign, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, etc. \n\nTreatment of minorities:\n\nMy understanding is that minority (non-Han) ethnic groups in China face systematic discrimination in socioeconomic mobility and unfair treatment in the judicial system, but I can't find any data at the moment to back me up. 93% of the country is ethnic Han, so it may very well be that the US has a more severe problem in this area by virtue of being more diverse.\n\nTreatment of migrants:\n\nChina has and continues to repatriate North Korean refugees, who face severe punishment upon return to North Korea. South Korea repeatedly asks that migrants be repatriated (if willing) to South Korea, but China generally refuses these requests. There are tens of thousands of North Koreans in China without access to education or basic government services due to the Chinese government's policy on repatriation. It should also be noted that China is a signatory to two UN conventions on the treatment of refugees.\n\nMigrants to the US have a comparatively much better situation, in spite of entrenched poverty and corrupt local law enforcement.\n\nI could go on, but like you said it's comparing apples and oranges. It's also kind of useless to see who has the bigger dick, here. Human rights abuses are very difficult to quantify in a way that allows for comparisons between countries, which is the main reason I felt a need to reply to OP in the first place.\n\nEDIT: Spelling"

You just see news every month because there is some new development that the media covers.\n\nThey are starting **only two banks**, each with the specific target of competing with some existing institution:\n\n* The New Development Bank (NDB), which will compete with the World Bank\n* The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which will compete with the IMF.\n\nNeither is being funded entirely by China, though China has the largest share given its large economy.\n\nThe NDB will initially have a lending capacity of $34 billion per year, which will be supported by an initial fund of $50 billion, which is contributed equally by the 5 BRICS countries ($10 billion each). In addition, they will have a contingent reserve arrangement (CRA) of $10 billion, which also be contributed equally by the five BRICS countries ($2 billion each). The goal is to eventually have a CRA of $100 billion, of which China will contribute $41 billion, Russia, India and Brazil $18 billion each, and South Africa $5 billion.\n\nThe AIIB has an initial capital of $100 billion, of which China will provide about half. So China does have the largest share, but it's by no means the only contributor. More importantly, this is just the funding at launch, when many countries are hesitant to commit money on something new. As confidence grows, so will investments.\n\nI know people like to demonize China on /r/worldnews, but as a matter of fact, these new banks will be a lot more democratic than the WDB/IMF. For example, with almost 50% of the initial capital outlay, China still only has 5.47% of the voting rights in the AIIB. Contrast that to the IMF with which it competes: the US and Japan (the two largest contributors to the IMF) have a 30% contribution to the outlay, but 26% of the voting rights. So with a smaller outlay (30% versus 50%), the US/Japan have 5 times more voting rights than China (26% versus 5.47%).\n\nThat doesn't make the AIIB an association of equals, we all know that China will play the biggest role. But it's still an improvement over the IMF.\n\nThe sad thing is that none of this had to be. China and India weren't asking for a whole lot of changes to the IMF. They only asked for 6% more voting rights towards the developing countries in the IMF. But US Congress refused that, so IMF reforms remain stalled.\n\nThe end result is going to be more independence from western control (which probably includes a lessening of US influence and a net gain of Chinese influence), and a weakening of the dollar."

aS'China didn\'t have the scientific base to industrialise. Europe didn\'t just wake up one day and industrialise. A long process by which modern science was invented ended up creating the engineer as a byproduct. There is no Brunel without Newton and there is no sign that modern science would have just sprung up somewhere else unless Europe got there first. The empirical approach with open and free discourse that became the model for European science was unique and absolutely crucial to the whole thing.\n\nChina was at one point clearly ahead of Europe but being ahead doesn\'t mean you have the cultural tools needed to expand that lead. It\'ll happen to Europe as well at some point. Claims that "well at one point Europe was ahead and could have done this" won\'t change the reality either.\n\n//edit - I\'d also say that there is as of yet no sign that China will surpass the west now. Right now China is a place that buys western machinery and has mass labour run it to produce commodities. Going beyond that is difficult. Japan tried it and it hasn\'t worked out for them. Chasing a target who are doing all the innovation is easier than leading from the front.'

aS'Part of the issue is that China is largely a conformist culture (the focus has changed but its still there) and what you are seeing is what has been going on for thousands of years, notably the family being and acting as a single entity. In this case the family would be the village and whilst they may disagree internally, externally they will present a unified "face".\n\nThe same thing used to happen in Japan where the village families would meet, talk then come to a "unanimous" conclusion at the end of it. \n\nChina also has issues with "independents" since they have caused so many issues throughout history. China is often referred to as the "land of the peasant rebellion" for a reason. A unified group survives much more easily especially in a land that experiences a civil war almost every time there is a food shortage due to climate.'

They have a vested interest in shaming western leaders to try and make them reduce emissions.\n \n\n.... \n\n&gt;As welcome as any growth in renewables is, I'd still like to point out that currently China uses more coal that the rest of the world combined.

That did not make it independent however. China kept trying to prove it's dominance (by sending armies) until 1921, when the White-Russian Army was asked to kick them out. The Red-Russian Army was then asked to kick the Whities out, and from that time there is a more or less independent Mongolia, but only recognised by Russia. At the end of WW2 (kapitalist) China was forced by the USA to recognise Mongolia, but they did not. The Socialist China of Moo Tse Tung finally did, in 1948, but still no other countries than those two neighbours. Mongolia applied for membership of UN each year from 1946, but each time this was blocked by Taiwan/Chiang Kai Chek.

China's communist party has achieved significant results but let's make no bones about it - the bulk of that good work was done by the people of China themselves, doing things that most people would consider inalienable rights - farming their own land, opening businesses, trading goods and services. Lest we forget, for thirty years these things were illegal in China, and the people were starving to death as a result of disastrously poorly though out economics. Deng Xiaoping opened things up and as a result China has bloomed. Should we thank the CCP? \n\nIf someone puts a boot on your neck for thirty years, would you thank them afterwards for your ability to breathe? \n\nYes, but the communists have engineered the system that achieved these results... (though they are plateauing well below every other East Asian country that has undergone the same process). Yes, but they've done nothing truly unique or original and they've had the help of the best economists in the world as well. I know I sound overly negative but I am just being a realist. \n \n \nThings work best in China when government claws are further away. Their SOE sector is a hideous drag on the economy as well as an affront to the notion of free market economics - even Xi and Li want government to retreat from the market.  \n Check today's sinosphere blog for more: http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/\n\nThe zeitgeist on China is about to change rapidly when people start taking an interest in their accounting practices.

Then the progressive Communists came and whipped both nations into the industrial revolution so that they could compete with Western powers. That alone is proof that communists can achieve strong growth - the Soviet Union's economy was growing faster than the US economy from it's creation to Brezhnev's stagnation - not including WW2 because large amounts of the Soviet industry and population was occupied. \n\nChina needed to open up not because communists couldn't achieve reults (under Mao the population exploded while GDP/c remained rather constant and human conditions vastly improved), but because it needed to import materials and technology from the outside world.

China's initial gains from 49-59 were followed by the disastrous Great Leap Forward which killed tens of millions, then the Cultural Revolution which significantly dented growth as well as turning society on its head. Deng's policies were more based on a sense of desperation and an understanding that they'd made a terrible choice when choosing state planning over free market economy. The opening up and reform period was far from a unified and controlled process. It was stop-start, varied from area to area, and saw experimentation trying to find a suitable balance between the absolute political control the party wants and the necessary freedom that free markets require. There's no evidence that there was any master plan or cunning blueprint. Quite the opposite. \n\nAnd most of the GDP gains are just natural, given the low base China started at. Not to deny the CCP all credit. The last 20 years of macroeconomic policy has been pretty inspired, though it seems to have led them to the same cliff that Japan found after going through the same process, and China only managed to climb half as high."

Furthermore officials almost always report being on target with whatever government policy is made regardless of reality.\n\nThis report was ultimately based off of official government stats. Governors that report anything worse that the required quotas can get demoted or fired, those that report great stats get promoted. There's no verification, so it's questionable.

aS'&gt;  but being ahead doesn\'t mean you have the cultural tools needed to expand that lead\n\nChina did have the cultural tools. If you look at the Tang Dyansty they already had a growing semi-industrial base. Also take for example [the philosophy of Mozi, who emphasized scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi):\n\n&gt; [Mozi\'s]... teachings emphasized self-reflection and authenticity rather than obedience to ritual. \n\n&gt; ...he criticized the Confucian belief that modern life should be patterned on the ways of the ancients. After all, he pointed out, what we think of as "ancient" was actually innovative in its time, and thus should not be used to hinder present-day innovation.\n\n&gt;  Mozi believed that people were capable of changing their circumstances and directing their own lives. They could do this by applying their senses to observing the world, judging objects and events by their causes, their functions, and their historical bases. This was the "three-prong method" Mozi recommended for testing the truth or falsehood of statements.\n\nThere were periods of scientific enlightenment followed by bureaucratic safety. And it was during a down period in Chinese culture that the Europeans were having their scientific revolution.\n\nAt this time, it was also nearing the end of the Ming dynasty, so of course they were more focused on politics. Whose to say that if let on their own, the Chinese wouldn\'t emphasize science and industrialization again.'

The people's whose homes are destroyed so some billionaire can open another shopping mall. They are of course compensated at the fantastic bargain of 50% of  the value of the land.

China is much bigger than the U.K. so naturally you'd expect things to drop at faster and bigger rates even if a large portion of the population still emits the stuff because the population itself is just so massive. I guess my point is people shouldn't jump the gun and start derailing other countries because China still has a lot to improve on, just like everyone else. Still, I think it's great that they've made this progress."

aS'&gt; So they arrested random civilians that had nothing to do with Hamas? They did everything they could to find the boys, including arrest of Hamas bureaucrats, is this not justified?\n\nYou\'re trying to tell me that 300-500 arrests were needed, that those 300-500 people all had something to do with the murder? And that there was also a good reason for not telling where those people were detained? This is btw not only collective punishment, but also a violation of the Geneva Convention.\n\n&gt; The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.\n\nProtected persons are civilians (the people who commited/helped with the crimes aren\'t protected)\n\nThe majority of the people who were detained hadn\'t anything to do with the crime or it\'s investigation, thus there was no lawful reason to arrest them (thus it\'s akin to kidnapping). They were unlawfully, against their will transported to an unknown place, pretty much the definition of kidnapping. And you know, you don\'t have to do anything brutal with them for it to be kidnapping. Even if you release them later it would still be kidnapping. The kidnapping is the part of taking them unlawfully against their will and maybe holding them somewhere against there will. It had an effect on the population, an effect of fear. They didn\'t have anything to do with it, yet they got "arrested" for it and Israel denied to say where they\'re being detained.\n\n&gt; Yeah I don\'t believe it that IDF attacks civilians on purpose. If we wanted we could kill off Gaza population in about a week. If civilians don\'t leave battle area it\'s their fucking problem. There\'s enough room in Gaza, enough good neighborhoods without tunnels. Look at the map of the fighting if you can find one, I\'m sure it\'s localized to just a few hotspots. I read that Hamas executed people for protesting against the war and for trying to leave battle areas. Too bad, but not my problem.\n\nNope it isn\'t. There are civilians in the area, you aren\'t allowed to ignore this. You can\'t go and say "well it\'s their problem that they were there". Civilian deaths are only allowed as part of collateral damage, but if there is no good reason to for example shoot at a building and a civilian gets killed in the process, then it\'s murder. It\'s a violation of the laws of war. Hamas could say "well all Israel is our war zone", so all civilians there can be killed by them, it\'s their issue for being in Israel? And also you say they should move away, yeah, many did move away during attacks. And returned after the attacks to scavage what\'s left of their belongings.\n\nMany moved to UN shelter during the war, which you bombed even though no attacks came from them. Oh wait, the UN inquiry was a lie fabricated by Hamas, and you believe IDF shot at them for a good reason, even though they can\'t show any evidence for it... Oh and all lies by IDF are just mistakes from Spokesman according to you...\n\nAnd also, you can\'t kill the whole Gaza population, because if you do this you\'ll be suddenly alone in the world. Even US won\'t side with Israel after commiting a genocide. The damage to Israels reputation would be so big, that you would suddenly stand alone in the world, US won\'t protect you anymore and Israels economy will collapse from sanctions. There is no way that anyone with a bit of brain would risk this, this is probably also the only reason why Israel didn\'t conquer everything yet, because the reputation loss would be too big for them. And yes they would without the world out there stopping them from doing so, they would\'ve build way more settlements without the world being angry at them for doing so. They stopped building settlements due to political pressure, not because they didn\'t want any more.\n\n&gt; I don\'t think settlements are war crimes. Where did you take this definition? Population transfer is a war crime if it\'s forceful, Jews moved to settlements voluntarily. The law may be applied but there\'s no precedent, despite many other occupation situation like Tibet, Crimea, Cyprus.\n\nI think this is pretty clear:\n\n&gt; The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention)\n\nIt doesn\'t metter if they want to go there or not, they\'re not allowed to build settlements.\n\nAnd also your examples, I don\'t know what it has to do with Tibet or Cyprus, but Crimea...\n\nWant a list of the sanctions that were put on Russia for what happened in Crimea? Want a list of sanctions that followed it? The world was pretty much completly against it, even Russias ally China didn\'t side with them! If Russia wasn\'t that powerful (nukes and oil), then the sanctions applied to it would be more significant, and maybe even military actions against it.\n\n&gt; International courts are total bullshit, it\'s where the strong exert their power on the weak, it\'s a popularity contest much like the Eurovision. \n\nMuch like Israeli courts? Using Human shields as Israeli soldier = 3months suspension and a demotion? But yeah, the world is against you all, all courts etc that aren\'t Israeli are just bullshit...\n\n&gt; About your last paragraph. There\'s nothing Israelis want more than peace. We thrive in peace, we sell a bunch of stuff to people, we invent stuff, we provide services to tourists. it\'s a great tourist area - I advise you to visit some time. We don\'t gain anything from war. We don\'t gain territory, or money, or respect.\n\nTell me, if you want peace so much, why vote for someone who said that under his reign there won\'t be a two state solution? The most likely solution for permanent peace, he said there will be none under his reign and you voted for him. And also Netanyahu is a notorious liar, you want me to believe lying isn\'t an Israeli strategy with someone like this in power?\n\nIf you want peace why hide the fact that the teens were most likely dead and send your soldiers into Area A without coordination with Palestinian Authority, a violation of the Oslo Accords, the IsraeliPalestinian peace process?\n\nIf you want peace so much, then why do Israeli soldiers who break the laws of war (like using Human shields) only get a slap on the wrist as punishment? (3months suspension and a demotion)\n\nIf you want peace so much, then why build settlements in the occupied territory, taking land from Palestinians and making it more difficult to come to a solution? I mean it\'s pretty difficult to make a Palestinian state if there are Israeli settlements spread throughout it... (Mind you that they only stopped building more settlements due to pressure from UN, US, etc., not because they\'re interested in peace and didn\'t want to make the situation worse down there)\n\nAnd how about [this](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-to-legalize-four-west-bank-settlement-outposts-slated-for-demolition-1.524291)? Right before peace talks, Israel "legalized" 4 illegal Israeli settlements in West Bank, which were marked for demolition. It\'s like saying "hey I just took another piece of your land, now we can talk about peace". Do you seriously want me to believe that people who act like this really want peace? It looks more like they want to take as much away from Palestinians as possible, giving them as few as possible, if they don\'t agree, take even more from them.\n\nAnother post is following since this one was too long...'

Reputation or more eloquently in Asian cultures "face" is as much a currency as the money in your hand. \n\nIts why China is cracking down on bad tourists, its hurting China\'s "Face" which means that its hurting China\'s social currency with the rest of the world and they are going to be punished as a result.\n\nIn terms of people deferring to you its very much a case of "avoid conflict". As in if you say something they will smile and nod then forget you exist the moment they walk away. Conflict in public is very much the ultimate embarrassment and they will do almost everything to avoid it (it changes in the big cities to more Western values due to American cultural immersion). Conversations (of note) are rarely held in public, its as much body language as anything else with the important things done in private. \n\nIts all very interesting and you can see aspects of it in popular culture i.e. the more "diplomatic" (read frustrating) species in Sci-fi/Fantasy as a result of historical views of Chinese people notably from that of European missionaries and traders.

aS"The Chinese have done extensive research on their energy and pollution challenges (e.g. [IET](http://english.iet.cas.cn/aboutus/overview/)) and National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIn 2013, they consumed 22.4% (US 17.8%) of world total energy and produce 23.2% while emitting 27.1% of world CO2 emissions. Overall, it's low on a per capita basis (1/4 of US/Canada). From 1990 to 2013, energy consumption increased 3.8x or 6% annually.\n\nProblem with their pollution: \n\n1. Highly dependent on coal (67%) vs US (20.1%) for energy production while US has much higher use of oil and gas. China has higher hydro production, but lower in nuclear until a dozen or so new reactors come online this year or next. Other renewables are negligible. Their domestic coal reserves are high, but have recently started importing. Their gas reserves are low and fracking has yet to begin due to the remoteness of their reserves and deeper locations (requiring more scarce water). \n\n2. Their industries are energy intensive and many have yet to be fully modern and more inefficient resulting in 30%-40% more energy use. They produce 48% of world cement, 49% of world crude steel, are #1 in many other energy intensive industries. These are low profit margin industries with high pollution (1 ton steel requires 600kg coal and 3-6 ton water for 60 cent USD profit in 2014). China's metals, oil and coal, minerals and chemicals contribute 9.6% of their GDP, but 52% of CO2 production.\n\n3. They have made some headway. They put sulfur scrubbers on 90% of their plants (from 48% in 2007) with 14% reduction from 06 to 2010. NOx and COx are still problems, but NOx is declining since 2011. At Copenhagen, they made commitments to reduce CO2 intensity by 40-45% from 2010 levels by 2005. The three main factors to CO2 production are economic growth, carbon intensity (inefficiency) and industry structure in their economy. On Jan 1st, 2015, the [new Environmental Protection Law](http://www.acc.com/accdocket/onlineexclusives/prcnepl.cfm) give their EPA more power and greater enforcement abilities and a shitload more. \n\nMore reading: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544207001284\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544215001966"

aS'&gt; China didn\'t have the scientific base to industrialise. \n\nNot really true. Stanford Historian Ian Morris has done some very interesting analysis about societal development in history.\n\nIt turns out that humans tend to breed out their surplus resources. Or at least used to. This means that while technology will be advancing very quickly at the "peak" of such a civilization, it won\'t be growing as fast as the population is eating away at the surplus which means that things are about to blow up.\n\nChinese peak (the time when it was clearly the most advanced place on the planet) was around 1150 in the Song Dynasty. However, it\'s massive population was already placing a tremendous weight on everything and Northern China got invaded at this point. By the time Genghis Khan rode in a hundred years later China\'s population had already shrunk by 33% and industrial production (in terms of steel &amp; shipping) had shrunk even more. \n\nThis was the third period in recorded history when humanity as a whole went downhill in the sense that the biggest city on the planet was smaller than a decade ago, the biggest army smaller than a decade ago etc. The other two incidents were in the Eastern Mediterranean in 1200BCE (the incident known for the whole "Sea Peoples" bit) and in Rome in the first century very soon after Augustus died. \n\nWhether Europe &amp; US continue to lead the way or not is an interesting question. There is no reason to assume one way or another based on history, as we\'re in really new territory right now. Though based on what we\'ve seen before, it\'s a good question whether we have the technological knowhow not to hit another "peak" and regress.'

I feel like countries like such as the US and China are now entering the phase that we had during the 60\'s and 70\'s.

You don\'t just become a "Communist state" overnight in terms of development. It takes generation and global communist revolution to accomplish Communism. It\'s the end stage of international human societal development.    \n2. The term "Communist state" makes no sense as Communism seeks to destroy the concept of statehood. Communism is what happens once all major countries adopted socialist governments and abandoned their national borders AND governments as well as the concept of national currency.  \n3. China never stopped being Communist. China is currently in the capitalist stage of national development. Which is a [necessary step](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx\'s_theory_of_history#The_stages_of_history) in ultimately becoming "communist".     \n4. China is a [socialist republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_China), which developed its own form of socialism (called [Socialism with Chinese Characteristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics)).   \n5. China continues to endorse Marxist ideals and continues establishing new legislation based on a Chinese interpretation of Marxist concepts.   \n6. While currently subscribing to capitalist development, China already considers itself to be in the early stages of socialism. Which is very true if you look at how the Chinese government actually operates and what the central planning in the country is aimed at and accomplishes.\n\nIt\'s really not that hard to look these things up, either, so I am very confused why people continue being so completely misinformed about both China and Communism.\n\nEdit: Great, keep downvoting the only comment actually explaining why these upvoted falsehoods are false.

aS"So tomorrow America and Europe decide to embargo all Chinese goods.  They are by far the largest consumers of cheap Chinese goods in the world.  Does China keep producing all those goods (and pollution) just because?  Or will pollution levels drop almost immediately?\n\nNow will the US and Europe look to themselves to create all those missing goods, making moderately more expensive domestic products?  Or will they look to the most cheapest alternative to Chinese goods?  Say they choose India to be their main producer.  They'll have to start from the ground to build all the infrastructure to compensate for the loss of China.  Will they build state of the art production facilities to produce environmentally sound goods, raising the cost of the final product by a marginal amount?  Or will they choose to get the cheapest most dirty product they can get their hands on?\n\nNot all the blame needs to go on the US and Europe, but their demand and corporation's lack of responsible sourcing are the main cause of pollution coming from China.  You can blame China for not introducing responsible environmental controls, but the same thing would happen no matter what country you decided to pick to be the main producer of the world's goods."

aS'Well, it\'s important to be able to make distinctions across history. If you look back at Maoist China, Holy Fucking Shit, yes, that was an *incredibly* totalitarian regime. During the cultural revolution, Mao\'s cult of personality was... unthinkable. The largest cult ever, in history. Using the phrase "brainwashed" to describe participants would be, I think, quite fair. China continues to engage in censorship and imprison/kill political opponents, but this isn\'t really in the same spirit as Maoist China. Back then, you had a system that was more akin to mind control than speech control. So China\'s current regime is very much qualitatively different from Mao\'s regime. This qualitative difference is, I think, best described as a difference between *totalitarianism* and *authoritarianism*.'

In terms of resource demand all that matters is absolute numbers, and in those raw numbers China's resource demands, especially for things like oil, are increasing faster than ever.\n\nJust kind of trying to expand on a related piece of what you're getting at - China is doing much better than we seem to want to believe in the West."

However,\n\n&gt;Not all the blame needs to go on the US and Europe, but their demand and corporation\'s lack of responsible sourcing are the main cause of pollution coming from China.\n\nIt seems like your point hinges on blaming those slovenly, shallow westerners because if China weren\'t the ones we\'d seek for these goods (because China would have better regulations), then we\'d just find another country for that.  Sure.  But how would blaming regular consumers change a thing?\n\nIt would change absolulely *nothing*.  You\'re not going to guilt-trip *anyone* to not buy any consumer goods anymore.  The percentage of people who would feel guilt-tripped is very small.\n\nBlaming the americans and westerners would have near net-zero effect on the amount of pollution.  Putting pressure on China, however, may move some industry but don\'t forget that not all industry is shallow consumer goods for shallow Americans.  No matter what, China has a billion people and will always have huge industry.  Getting them to be stricter about pollution would help matters far more than just saying "Well, if fat slovenly Americans weren\'t such capitalists, then we wouldn\'t be in this mess!"'

As for morals, if I had to apply anything, it would be greed and ignorance.  Greed for the corporations who don't care about where they get their product as long as it is as cheap as possible.  Ignorance applies to the consumer, since they will always look for a value and most will not care to find out the true cost of their purchases.\n\nI'm pointing out that consumer demand is driving the pollution problem.  If you had no demand, you would have very little pollution.  It's not a guilt trip.  It's a reality check.  Everyone is blaming China for the pollution problem, but they don't accept their own responsibility for the problem.  It's their demand for cheap goods which drives the problem.  \n\nChina is already working to fix the issue, but guess what, it's going to come at a price.  When that price gets to high, companies will get their products from somewhere cheaper and probably a lot more dirty.  Then all the pressure you put on China will be worthless as some other country with lax environmental laws will become the major polluter on the planet.  \n\nWestern corporations are outsourcing their pollution problems.  The manufacturing that is done in China used to be in America.  It's a shell game, they swap their pollution to China, so now the corporation and the US don't have to be responsible for the pollution that their products create, China does.\n\nChina should be held responsible for the issues they are causing, but to blind yourself to the fact that it's customers are equally as guilty, is plain ignorance."

aS'The reason the US did not accept legal responsibility is because the US does not acknowledge the existence or authority of any international legal body or legal theory that supercedes the US Constitution.  To accept legal responsibility would be to acknowledge the authority of some other legal body to judge US international or military actions.  To do otherwise would be to subject US officials to tribunals like the International criminal Court and the like.  \n\nThat said, the US did pay restitution, did acknowledge that faulty equipment coupled with very bad judgment led to the incident, and did immediately alter its behavior in the Gulf.\n\nNow with all of that said, please find for me any written evidence where Iran apologized for, paid restitution for or accepted legal responsibility for (a) illegal boarding civilian vessels in the Persian Gulf during 1988; (b) the illegal mining of international waters within the Persian Gulf frequented by commercial shipping vessels and civilian vessels necessitating the presence of US warships to escort them in and out of the Gulf; or (c) the attacks on civilian and US military vessels by those mines, including [this one](http://articles.philly.com/1988-04-15/news/26252750_1_escort-mission-iran-s-farsi-island-sowing-mines).\n\nThere isn\'t enough space in this thread to provide you with all of the background that led up to the shooting down of Iran Air 655, which itself was a minor sidenote to the longer history of the US military involvement in the Middle East.  But I will tell you that in 1988, every single paper ran stories about tensions in the Persian Gulf on the front page every morning, and newscasts at night led with the story.  This is against the larger background of the Cold War and the alliances created by the US since the 1950\'s to ensure the order and stability of world petroleum markets.  Bray and squeal all you want about "blood for oil" and the Bush family, but nearly every European country that wasn\'t occupied by the Soviet Union backed the US, as did every other country in the middle east.\n\nAnd despite all that, the US owned up to the tragedy immediately.  No denial, no finger pointing.  \n\nNow look at what Russia is doing.  Look at the broader context.  Has post-communist Russia developed in any way like post-communist China, with thought and careful planning?  No.  Russia took all of the absolute worst superficial aspects of western capitalism--the gawdy consumption, the greed, the cronyism, the lowest-common-denominator mercantilism--and took absolutely none of the rest, the ingenuity, the industriousness, the meritocratic ideal, none of it.

aS"&gt;*The point isn't whether they should do it or not, the point is that it's an unsustainable solution that will have catastrophic-like effects on their economy if not addressed very soon.*\n\nSince it's unsustainable, that means China shouldn't ever have done it. Double-digit economic growth is unsustainable, China should've grew at a more sustainable 3% in perpetuity like a developed country so they can enjoy living in poverty for a few decades more.\n\nChina should be giving away the huge influx of investment money too as a result of their unsustainable manufacturing policies so they can be a backwater like Central Asia, instead of using their money to transition into a more domestic consumption-based society and leap up the production ladder like every single other country in East Asia following the Japanese/Korean/Asian Tiger development model. Surely China will now deviate from this model they have been following ever since Deng Xiaoping and be content to remain the world's factory forever.\n\nI mean, it's not like China were making low quality textiles 50 years ago, and then moved onto VCRs and plastic toys a few decades ago, then flooding other markets for low-end electronics in the last 20 years, then video game consoles and smartphones recently, and now exporting solar panels and high-speed rail to the rest of the world.\n\nYou've convinced me!

aS'What pain would that be? The current rate of global warming is pretty slow even though global CO2 emissions have continued to rise - mostly because of China\'s industrialisation. Also switching from coal to gas for electricity generation actually causes CO2 emissions to fall. So the US\'s CO2 emissions fell at a time when the EU\'s rose. The same thing happened in the UK during the \'dash to gas\'. One of the reasons the UK didn\'t have a problem with Kyoto is because it was already on track to make the necessary CO2 emissions reductions thanks to the switch from coal to gas for power generation. \n\nThe US famously didn\'t sign Kyoto but made the cuts anyway. Meanwhile apart from the UK and Sweden most countries that signed Kyoto didn\'t make the cuts. And in any case China had the most dramatic rise in CO2 emissions over the lifetime of Kyoto but was exempted. Even now China\'s emissions will continue to rise until 2030. Which means that global CO2 emissions will rise too.\n\nEdit I replied to this comment which /u/morsas deleted\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SgcLK0t.png\n\n&gt; How is the fasted climate change ever recorded pretty slow?

Long before that we\'ll all be that. 50 thousand years is not much in the lifetime of a species and it is the blink of an eye to the planet.\n\nIt\'s not going to keep warming at two degrees per century though, for the simple reason that it\'s not linear. \n\nhttp://motls.blogspot.com/2014/09/one-half-of-co2-doubling-achieved.html\n\n&gt; The doubling defines more natural benchmark values of the concentration because it suggests that we should look at the behavior of the temperature assuming the exponential growth of CO2. That\'s natural because the temperature increase is approximately (very accurately) proportional to the logarithm of the CO2 concentration increase (thanks, John). Consequently, every time you double the CO2 level, the temperature increases by the same amount (ignoring non-CO2 drivers). The global mean temperature as a function of the CO2 concentration is\n&gt;\n&gt; T(c)=14.5C+sensitivityln(c/280 ppm)ln2\n&gt;\nThe temperature 14.5 degrees Celsius is the holy "optimum" global mean temperature that the climate alarmists want to see forever (yes, they will also protect our blue, not green planet from future ice ages when the temperature would otherwise drop by 8 C as many times in the past) because it was how things probably were in 1750 although no one can really reconstruct the temperature in 1750 with a sub-degree accuracy (and even today\'s "global mean temperature" depends on so many technicalities that it\'s fair to say that it isn\'t defined at a sub-degree accuracy, either). The ratio of logarithms may also be written as the "base two logarithm" but I wanted to use basic functions only. Note that ln20.69315.\n&gt;\nThe coefficient "sensitivity" is theoretically equal to 1.2 degrees Celsius if we ignore all the feedbacks. The total figure when feedbacks (especially those related to various forms of water in the atmosphere) are included is unknown and it may be higher or lower than 1.2 degrees Celsius. One of the unjustified assumptions of the climate change ideology is that the full figure has to be higher. The higher value of the climate sensitivity you defend, the greater influence over the climate alarmist paramilitary movement you achieve. If you believe that the value of the total climate sensitivity is below an offensive threshold, you are a heretic. The offensive threshold used to be 3 degrees Celsius but the alarmists were forced to lower the threshold of heresy to 1.5-2.0 degrees Celsius because those values are obviously consistent with all the known data (and probably still overestimates).\n\nWhy are you worried about the weather in 50,000 years time.

aS"Depends on who it fails between.   Iran/Israel or India/Pakistan would kill millions (possibly billions in the case of India/Pakistan) and devastate an entire region of the globe.   But the radiation released would be less than by the atomic testing carried out during the 50s.   The people back then set off 521 **above ground** nuclear tests with a yield of 279 megatons.   That is a much larger yield and vastly more bombs than the combined arsenals of India/Pakistan and vastly more than anything Iran/Israel will have anytime in the near future.  The world survived the radiation released by those tests despite many of the bombs being unusually dirty by modern standards.   \n\nWhile they don't talk about it publicly, it is believed that both China and Israel have both drastically reduced their stockpiles by retiring many of their crude older bombs.   China is estimated to have around 240 active nukes and Israel around 80 active.  India has around 110 and Pakistan had approximately 120 in 2013, but unlike the others they are building more.  So unless the US (1,900 active) and Russia (2,500 active) get involved the world would have a very bad day but would almost certainly survive.   The giant species ending 30,000 plus nuclear weapon arsenals maintained by the US and Russia in the cold war are thankfully a thing of the past."

aS'In this context, consumption-oriented really only refers to the components of GDP which contribute to the total national economic growth figure most economists use as a rough barometer of a country\'s economic health. [Here is a quick chart](http://imgur.com/6LbLEXT) I put together showing the breakdown of GDP for a handful of illustrative economies. In this simplified framework, GDP is the sum of household consumption, investment (also known as capital formation, i.e. building a new mine, or constructing a new factory), government spending, and the net trade balance (simply exports - imports). Over the past decade, China has been embarking on a grand economic experiment, where the government facilitates the mass injection of investment capital into the economy to build out infrastructure, production facilities, natural resource extraction, power generation, etc. As other commenters suggested, China is effectively trying to accomplish in 10 years what most of the developed world accomplished over the course of the 20th century.\n\nIn order to fund this experiment, the Chinese government has gone to great lengths to artificially suppress the value of their domestic currency. In so doing, they have been able to maintain a net positive trade balance, which has helped to fund the mass development described earlier. Ultimately, as their own citizens\' living standards rise, and become less competitively priced (from a global labor perspective), China will struggle to maintain this currency suppression and positive trade balance. This whole endeavor, according to many observers, is inherently unsustainable, as it in many ways relies on the persistence of the very same global trends and imbalances that it steadily erodes. Thus a consumption-oriented economy, one in which the majority of the country\'s GDP is driven by domestic consumption, is considered more sustainable (by some) in that it relies primarily on local, rather than global, dynamics. Recall that extracting natural gas in Texas, turning it into plastics in Michigan, turning that plastic into a toy in Illinois, and selling that toy to a child in Minnesota, is all rolled into domestic consumption (the toy\'s retail value theoretically reflects all of the component steps, materials, etc.). So "consumption" is not necessarily dependent on imports, despite the fact that the US has maintained a net negative trade balance since 1975. Germany, for example, is a consumption-oriented economy that maintains a positive trade balance.'

A nation that has opposed the jihadism of Iran, Houthis, Hezb, AQ, ISIS, and Hamas? Do you know the individual ways each of these guys have spread the ideology of violent extremism? That\'s not Saudi Arabia doing that. I assure you, the king prefers docile, passive, non-violent citizens to rule over.\n\nChange doesn\'t come overnight like in a democratic nations\' elections. It takes decades of modernization programs and multiple reigns of different leaders/kings.\n\nWhy would you wage war against friendly nations to the West? Just because you disagree with their methods? \n\nWe are enemies with countries that have attacked us or harmed us or our allies. We are not enemies with countries just because of some methods they used. We may condemn them for it in front of the UN to "use more humane tactics", but we won\'t become enemies with them.\n\nAnd for the record: **Iran and China execute WAY MORE than Saudi Arabia**.

Aside from demands of the separatists (who literally commit acts of terror), most of the grievances the Uyghurs have involve not sharing *enough* with China's economic growth, especially when they seek employment in China's wealthier Eastern provinces.  \n\nThe Tibetan Autonomous Region is 90% ethnically Tibetan.  Most Han migration has been to the larger cities which, as of right now are something like half of Tibet's population but have historically been less than 10% (the population of Lhasa was less than 5% of the TAR's population in the '60s whereas it is 20% of it today).

aS'Uhhh... I seem to recall some clauses at the end of WW2 and some language in the ceasefire agreement pertaining to Japan. \n\n&gt;One Japanese contribution that was directly controlled by the United States Navy was ScaJap, or the Shipping Control Administration Japan. Operating under the orders of Commander Naval Forces Far East, ScaJap provided logistic support for the Occupation forces with its fleet of Japanese-crewed ships, most of which were former U.S. Navy Landing Ships Tank, or LSTs. From the first days of U.S. involvement in the conflict, ScaJap transported men, weapons and supplies to Korea. Its LSTs were absolutely invaluable to the prosecution of the War, representing as many as three-quarters of the LSTs available for the amphibious operations at Inchon, Wonsan, and Hungnam, as well as for the day-in and day-out work of routine logistics.\n\nWhen the Korean war began Japan was still occupied:\n\n&gt;In the third phase of the occupation, beginning in 1950, SCAP deemed the political and economic future of Japan firmly established and set about securing a formal peace treaty to end both the war and the occupation. The U.S. perception of international threats had changed so profoundly in the years between 1945 and 1950 that the idea of a re-armed and militant Japan no longer alarmed U.S. officials; instead, the real threat appeared to be the creep of communism, particularly in Asia. **The final agreement allowed the United States to maintain its bases in Okinawa and elsewhere in Japan, and the U.S. Government promised Japan a bilateral security pact.** In September of 1951, fifty-two nations met in San Francisco to discuss the treaty, and ultimately, forty-nine of them signed it. Notable holdouts included the USSR, Poland and Czechoslovakia, all of which objected to the promise to support the Republic of China and not do business with the Peoples Republic of China that was forced on Japan by U.S. politicians.\n\nFrom the bilateral agreement:\n\n&gt;The agreement contained five articles, which dictated that Japan grant the United States the territorial means for it to establish a military presence in the Far East. Moreover, the accord stated that Japan be prohibited from providing foreign powers any bases or any military-related rights without the consent of the United States. \n\nThis agreement was superseded in 1960 by the mutual cooperation treaty:\n\n&gt;Article 5, which dealt with armed attacks by a third party, required that the United Nations Security Council be involved and that any measures taken by the U.S. and Japan be ceased "when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security."\n\nAnd the argument that Japan\'s constitution prevents them from interceding in foreign countries because the US is attacked is false as of 2014:\n\n&gt;In July 2014, the Japanese government approved a reinterpretation which gave more powers to its Self-Defence forces, allowing them to defend other allies in case of war being declared upon them, despite concerns and disapproval from mainland China and South Korea, whereas the United States of America supported the move.\n\nHowever even still the text of Article 9 makes it clear that Japan renounce their *sovereign right*,\n\n&gt;ARTICLE 9. Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\n\nBecause of the emphasis given to the UN &amp; the Security Council (where the US holds a permanent seat) it could be argued that Japan cannot legally act without US (or UN) permission, and therefore is subject to US command as agreed to by South Korea in the armistice. There is ample precedent for this.\n\nHowever, because it is fully understood that any attack on America would result in an immediate and unavoidable war... the Japanese are basically saying they would act on American behest and retaliate immediately until UN Command (cough, America) gets a handle on the situation. \n\nThis would be legal if America/UN doesn\'t object after the fact, but could also be used against them. In the case of North Korea attacking... that probably isn\'t going to be the case.\n\n\n'

aS'Let\'s tackle your post in bullet-points:\n\n1) Based on my submitted evidence, China has also demonstrated clear intent to assert soverignty in the region, administered it as part of Hainan, managed its resources, and contested claims against France. China is "most active claimant", earliest "effective occupant", and possessed similar historical claims (if not superior) to the island. The article\'s impression of an unbroken history of Vietnamese administration by omitting everything in the gaps is rather academically dishonest, don\'t you think?\n\n2) Following French withdrawal, North Vietnam (the side that won) actually admitted the sovereignty of China for a time, and supported China expelling South Vietnamese ships from those isles.\n\n3) Vietnam "peacefully" slaughtered the indigenous Champa people to get at those islands, which strangely is not mentioned by your article. It is on Wikipedia though.\n\n4) China has been militarily occupying the islands far longer than 1956, as mentioned.\n\n5) Somehow for doing similar things to what China had already done, Vietnam has "legally and effectively established its title to the islands" whereas China according to this writer has not. Sorry, who is the legal body here?\n\n6) China has settled 17 of its 23 disputes without relying on international arbitration, and has loudly condemned unrelated third parties from involving themselves in territorial disputes in which they have no stake.

aS'I only remember this from a documentary and don\'t have a source at hand, but I think the especially preferential treatment in Japan wasn\'t solely due to a desire to avoid Weimar Germany 2.0.  Again, from my hazy memory, I believe that the US wanted a strong ally in the Asian region, and were learning towards the Republic of China.  When things went sour and the ROC made its way to Taiwan, there was even the thought of working with Mao\'s communist China (oh, the humanity!).  Unfortunately, the Korean War broke out and Japan was left as "the next best choice".  I doubt that Americans would have been too happy with buddying up with Japan so quickly with the memories of the war so fresh if there was another alternative. '

aS"We appreciate this, Japan, we really do.\n\nBut the moment North Korea launches a first strike is the moment the regime loses all credibility.\n\nThink about it.\n\nSo long as North Korea doesn't engage in any sort of war, the people will remain convinced nobody WANTS to take them on. This ensures their confidence in the regime, keeps them from wanting to leave, and keeps them from wanting to revolt.\n\nLet's not forget the best nukes North Korea has are 1/3 the power of the Fat Man Bomb, meaning they could only kill about 8 city blocks worth of people, and they only recently were able to miniaturize the technology to be fitted on rockets, and even then, they can't get very far.\n\nEven in submarines, North Korea couldn't move out very far without being detected.\n\nLastly, China has had just about enough of the DPRK's shit. The current president has never even visited there. North Korea purely exists as a buffer between SK and China; the moment North Korea fucks up, China will withdraw any support whatsoever.\n\nIf North Korea WERE to go on the offensive, it could be decisively crushed within a few months at the very most. The North Korean elite aren't stupid enough to risk their very livelihood on a suicidal mission.\n\nThe sad thing is, when Korea is eventually reunified, there will be the occasional holdout lurking in the mountains determined to reestablish True Korea, since they could never adjust. There'll be a mall shooting and such every so often, until they either give up or die trying.\n\nSo again, thanks Japan for the kind gesture, but chances are we won't need your assistance. You are a terrific ally and we appreciate your being there."
p1639
aS"Exactly. [I'm chinese btw.]\n\nIf Japan were to rearm themselves officially, no country in the region (By that I mean NK, SK, Russia, and China) would be happy and it would justify further Chinese scrambling and declarations. \n\nJapans navy is already equivalent to China's and their army matters little since they're an island. The US also has a fleet based there. \n\nWhat Japan needs is to continue to keep their JSDF at the level it is, but not provoke China. China is looking for an opportunity to force the US to make a choice between political fallout or the loss of a close ally. A Japanese change in the constitution and rearmament would not only allow China complete justification for their own military build up, it'll make the US look bad and it'll also start a mini-Cold War in the area. \n\nTl:DR: Japan getting rearmed will only cause trouble for everyone, and the Japanese people don't even want it. Japan's got a powerful force already anyways. "

What benefit does China get? No they did not veto the sanctions because they don\'t want Iran to even have the technology!\n\nNow why does Saudi Arabia not get punished? Well first of all, their expression for nuclear weapons is a negotiation ploy, to put pressure on Iran. Which is understandable, if your enemy has a nuclear program, you want one too right? But the most important reason is that Saudi Arabia can influence the price of oil and is one of the most important strategic relations the USA has. Simple as that.\n\nWhy Pakistan wasn\'t punished? They were, you can read about it, but life goes on. Israel was never punished, but again, huge ally. I don\'t think you can call Israel a volatile nation.\n\nThere are some questions about Iran\'s nuke program, I think consensus is that Iran wants to build "breakout" capability. That means they have the know how to make a nuke, but don\'t actually make it. Sort of like how Japan is. But, Iran did look into some aspects of nukes that they have never explained, you can read about it in the IAEA reports.  \n\nAnd thats just the nuke program. We have absolute solid evidence that Iran is building a ballistics missile program. You know, to be able to hit Europe, or the US. You don\'t build that for just regular explosives.'

aS"After Pakistan and India got their Independance from the British Empire in 1947, they were heavily opposed to one another, especially due to the massive deaths that took place on the border as thousands of Hindus in Pakistan and Muslims in India were displaced from their homes.\n\nIndia, under Jawaharlal Nehru began to move towards a socialist style government, as Nehru believed in the idea that everyone was equal under the government, and a socialist government would be one of the best ways to recognise India's secular ideals. This made India and the USSR natural allies.\n\nThe USA at this point in time was operating on a policy of containment. China was already on its way to Mao Zedong's rise, which happened in 1949, and the US was beginning to worry about the spread of communism. The USA's policy in order to counteract this spread by aiding those who were seen as the direct opposition to these ideas. As a result, the US naturally sided with Pakistan. It is important to note that this was hardly a bad choice at the time, as we had not yet seen the full threat of radicalised Islam, and Pakistan and India were on somewhat equal footing. \n\nHowever, even after India began to quickly pull ahead, and started the non-aligned movement to counteract the Cold War, the US chose to maintain its close relationship with Pakistan. It projected its power in 1971, and may have gotten involved in that Indo-Pakistan war, had India not asked the Soviets to make it clear that such an act would result in the USSR's involvement as well.\n\nAs Pakistan began to fall behind India, it also began to fall prey to fundamentalist Islam. In order to keep Pakistan on the path of progress and maintain its competitiveness against India, the US chose to supply it with economic aid. Although the Cold War is over, and Indo-US ties have warmed considerably, Pakistan is still the US' staunchest South Asian ally. The US infrastructure and military bases there mean that propping up the government with exorbitant amounts of money is cheaper than simply letting it get destroyed. Much of this money that goes to support the Pakistani government is designate as aid for various reasons.\n\n**TL;DR:** India was socialist, so the US freaked out and supported Pakistan. Now they're so invested, it's cheaper to single handedly support the Pakistani government than it is to let the government fail."

aS'&gt;If NK were to use such weapons against anyone in the world, it would result in the rather immediate disassembly of their entire country.\n\nThat\'s highly debatable. Even if they nuke an American city, the response would never be to glass the whole country. First of all, that would be murdering millions of innocent people who had no say in their government\'s attack. Second of all, that even would not happen in isolation, and at the very least you\'d had tons of radioactive fallout landing in South Korea and Japan, possibly even China if the wind is right. Politically this would be a *highly* destabilizing event as it would ensure that total nuclear warfare is now on the table and thus a thinkable option for every other nation. Say the US and China go to war for something; how hard to you think China would believe it could hit the US before it gets the full nuclear treatment? Do you think they\'d test it to find out? Or do you think they\'d skip a few pages and preemptively nuke the US in an effort to mitigate the US\'s ability to nuke them? It\'s impossible to know, but the precedent would have been established: the US nukes countries into dust (even if they might have asked for it). \n\n&gt;Unlike radical terror groups, NK isn\'t fighting for an ideal.\n\nAbsolutely laughable. They fight for their Stalinist/Maoist hybrid version of Communism, which is their state religion and which is diametrically opposed to everything the ROK stands for. Their cause is unification, just like the South\'s. Also just like the South, the only scenario they can accept is unification under their form of government and on their terms.\n\n&gt;They want to exist and prosper as a nation.\n\nYeah, they\'ve clear got that at the top of their list of things to do... Seriously, where are you getting these ideas? The entire purpose of the entire nation is to fight the final war with the South and unify the country, and in the process push out the Americans, which they see as imperialists on par with the Japanese. Their entire society is geared towards that end, and nothing else really matters, at least officially. \n\n&gt;Lashing out and dying is not an acceptable strategy for them.\n\nIt most certainly *is*. Their endgame scenario is making a last ditch all-out assault on the South when it is clear that any other choice will lead to their destruction, whether from within or without. They can\'t allow a certain level of instability to prevail or else it will have a snowball effect, so when they reach a critical point of instability, for whatever reason, their plan is to pull the rug out from under the forces causing that stability by initiating the final war, which naturally has a unifying effect on populations and which can be used to justify extreme measures while being easy to cover up such measures.\n\n&gt;Their nuclear capability prevents others from taking initial strikes against them: a nuclear retaliation is a serious threat.\n\nNot really. Their massive conventional force has done a great job of preventing initial strikes against them, especially their artillery. Nuclear weapons, for them, are bargaining tools, and they always have been. With nukes at the ready, they can initiate their final war, safe in the knowledge that if things stall or start to go sideways, they can lock down their gains and prevent counter-attack by threatening to nuke stuff if their enemies don\'t come to the negotiating table. Unlike before, they would likely have the ability to lock down a proper peace treaty. If this happens when Seoul and its surrounding metro area are in their control (which would only take a matter of days to accomplish), then they would effectively win the conflict as the South would no longer be economically, politically, or militarily viable. It would only be a matter of time before the North would then be able to absorb the rest of the South. This plan isn\'t fool-proof, but they do stand a good chance of getting at least part of it done, whereas before they had nukes they had pretty much no chance of ending a war on their terms before a counter-attack would be managed.\n\n&gt;But for them to take the initiative is basically inconceivable. They can\'t blow up the rest of the world. A nuclear attack would unite the entire world against them.\n\nFor the most part, that\'s right, and they know that. They have a no first use policy (though who knows if they\'d actually stick to that), and they have a lot more incentive to just threaten with their nukes as opposed to use them. But if they did use them, it certainly wouldn\'t be "the whole world against them". You\'ve been playing too much Civ4. Most countries would not care, or would merely condemn their attacks, lacking any reasonable means for retaliating or punishing them. Most European countries can barely maintain their military forces, let alone deploy them to the other side of the planet to fight a massive military force. China wouldn\'t do anything, nor would Russia. They\'d have nothing to gain from that and it would degrade their nuclear strike capabilities if they were publicly condemning North Korea\'s nuclear first strike (they both have first-use policies in place that help maintain deterrence, as does the US). But for the most part, North Korea is largely immune to global reactions, economically or militarily. South Korea, Japan, and the US are in a position to punish them, sure, but outside that the rest of the world would be unwilling or unable.'

The acid very, very slowly eats away at the structural integrity of the concrete support structure.  Even the slightest deterioration can be catastrophic when dealing with heavy load-bearing structures.  Add in acid rain (also prevalent in China), and the weaknesses are further compounded.\n\nThe majority of China's infrastructure has been built with essentially lame concrete.

I think it's not smart for Beijing to piss of its neighbours with the tough stance in the South China sea, but China has claimed the area since (at least) the 1940s.

aS'Good post, thank you.\n\n&gt;*I think it\'s not smart for Beijing to piss of its neighbours with the tough stance in the South China sea, but China has claimed the area since (at least) the 1940s.*\n\nI think this area deserves special emphasis: why now? I have several hypotheses, but the true answer may be a combination of these:\n\n1) Xi Jinping\'s assertiveness: he\'s different from his predecessors in terms of distancing away from the "peaceful rise" of China, in which leaders try to minimize challenging the global status quo. His leadership style is considered more dominant by China analysts due to the anti-corruption purges that has been happening. Rising relative military strength of the PLA versus other countries and the US also plays a part in this explanation.\n\n2) Fostering nationalist sentiments at home: possibly to take the focus away from current/future economic woes. However, China is noted to be actually quite generous in settling territorial disputes if there are problems at home, instability being a big factor in quick settlements of land disputes with China\'s neighbours. But: maritime disputes may be different, which China sees as more vital than land disputes.\n\n3) China "backed into a corner" in terms of strategic vulnerabilities in the straits: I\'m a bit biased towards this explanation over the others. As you say, it is not smart for Beijing to piss off their neighbours with an overly tough stance. However, if a certain line is crossed and China would lose less (strategically) if they adapted a tough stance than the diplomatic penalty, then China would adapt a tough stance. This coincides with the US "Pivot to Asia" in terms of timing, so it is likely that China fears that future meekness may allow the US to put a stranglehold on China via control of this region.'
p1722
aS"Well, I was just pointing out that the US is targeting China explicitly with this policy, not that it's unfair so the US shouldn't do it. I do think it is unfair, but the US isn't going to stop no matter what I believe.\n\nI agree with you why the US did not make a move against Vietnam building islands, but did so against China. Vietnam isn't a threat. If the positions were reversed and China was much weaker than Vietnam, then the US would've focused on them instead."
p1723
aS'Some thoughts\n\n1) China actually took back Paracel islands decades ago, killing some Vietnamese occupiers. Xi is not more assertive than Mao or Deng were. He has been open to making peace with India and is definitely a lot more "open-minded" on Taiwan. The rest of the world is simply more sensitive to the same assertiveness China has always had.\n\n2) China has been settling borders for a long time now, with long-running discussions from 1950 through 1991 and ongoing peaceful discussions with Bhutan. It\'s just that Vietnam and the Philippines have never really been at the negotiating table, whereas Malaysia has and therefore has refused to align with the other two.\n\n3) If you\'re saying China is being more assertive because the US is being increasingly obnoxious and hypocritical I\'d agree. China basically did everything America wanted so now they\'re reaching deeper to find pretexts to essentially oppose every single thing China does. US whined about currency, China appreciates currency by 5-6% a year. US moves on to Iran, China gets on board about Iran. US complains about North Korea, China gets friendlier with South Korea and attempts to bring NK to the negotiating table. US whines about espionage, then Snowden blows the cover off that. So now America needs to crap out some nonsense about "freedom of navigation" as if China has ever considered restricting it in the SCS last 2,000 years or so. Even as far back as 1979 China got the States\' (and Thailand\'s) blessing to smack Vietnam for trying to militarily dominate Indochina in Russia\'s name. \n\nEven if Xi capitulates, which he absolutely will not, the States will just invent some other pretext for its hostile, menacing behavior toward China. I\'m guessing it\'ll be the "Uyghur" next. Once Chinese leaders realize this they will "normalize" i.e. start spending more than a piddly 1.8% or less of GDP (and 5% of the budget vs. 16% in India and the States) on defense. THEN America will actually consider treating China on more equal terms, contrary to everything they\'ve been saying.'

aS'Actually there were lots of literate non-Chinese in the region so yeah we have a large number of sources attesting to why the Mongols, Manchu, Tibetans etc were annexed. All of them have been waging war against China for hundreds if not over a thousand years. China has no reason to expand into barren, desperately poor regions except to use them as buffers and pacify the locals - they on the other hand have had all the reason in the world to repeatedly loot Chinese cities. Now they consider themselves to be part of "Zhongguo" anyway, for the most part. Regardless of what CNN, Fox, etc propaganda is saying.\n\nOnly southward expansion was morally questionable. But the experience of Taiwan and Canton show nothing but restraint - it was only when Northern China was destabilized that military aristocrats moved South, established a government, and created states out of dozens of warring tribes. Even so aboriginal welfare was a priority for Chinese states as well as other non-official "Chinese" powers such as rebels or rump states. Koxinga, a CHinese merchant-pirate warlord, showed more kindness to Taiwanese aborigines than any European power ever did to natives in Canada, Australia, Americas, Siberia, Africa, India ... etc.'

China is reclaiming land because every single claimant to the SCS has been doing it for decades, and China is only playing catch up after it\'s clear they\'re not going to stop.\n\nChina tried to pursue diplomacy but the Philippines and Vietnam gave her the middle finger, immediately occupying about 20 and 50 unoccupied features in the area respectively.\n\nChina has solved almost all of her land borders peacefully, with states much weaker than either of those two, like Laos and Tajikistan.\n\nUS corporate media is lying through its teeth as usual.'

p1766
aS"&gt; Reclamation isnt necessarily a violation of international law, but its certainly violating the harmony\n\nThe big part of this is that China is a signatory to maritime territory laws that state that reclaimed land and artificial islands do not count as territory and cannot be claimed and used to extend an exclusive economic zone or territorial waters. China isn't making these claims yet but when they do, then it will be illegal and that's when it could spark a war. \n\nThe US does freedom of maritime navigation operations through that area all the time. This just means that US flagged governmental vessels transit through the area. It's a show of force to show that the sea lanes are open and navigable. One of these days, China is going to claim this area as their territorial waters which means they are well within their rights (if it were their territorial waters) to sink the American ship. If they don't, they look weak and so does their claim in the area which undermines the governments push to be a world power.

Looking at debt-to-GDP, China is still far below many Euro Zone countries, the US, etc. Their debt as a whole is mainly domestic, from state-owned banks and companies that don't carry much default risk.

There is a consequence to it. The Chinese government doesn't just create this stuff for free. It is taken directly from the people's pockets.\nTo answer your question, I think government has a responsibility to fill in the gaps in things like public transportation, housing, etc. However, they are not filling in the gaps, they are instead creating a whole new set of gaps that will have to be filled eventually. The common people will be footing the bill for that when it happens as well."

But just as much as they'll delay other purchases. I think the particular public obsession with Chinas real estate market is simply due to our last crisis. **Everybody always looks back when trying to look ahead.**\n\nThat said, **there is** still **trouble brewing in china**.

This type of practice really dates back to the "5 year" soviet style economic plans whereby the policies all focused on being able to report big numbers. The soviets would famously make vastly excessive quantities of something they focused on and not of other things.

The new leadership dismantled the policies put in place for a greener australia. Funnily enough, the labor party still tried to negotiate that they should be able to save carbon units saved from the previous schedule for businesses cooperating with the original green plan. And the UN caved. Basically they got the trade benefits for being green by only doing half the things they needed to do and then dismantling the program. \n\nChina threw a bitchfit when they moved to schedule 1 because they are now held accountable for their carbon emissions to maintain trade rights with the UN. They did the same thing australia did: poured money into companies that promised renewables. However,there was very little oversight. The biggest player in solar: Hanergy went bankrupt this morning after it revealed that it was channeling the money to a holding company to buy real estate in HOng kong.

This trade would be largely uninterrupted in any military conflict with China.  \n\nThe US does have the dominant blue water navy and China ships most exports by sea.  It is easy to imagine a scenario where the US all but stops Chinese trade while having their own non-chinese trade uninterrupted.  "

But for Western narrative thinking ahead means creating a bubble because it's impossible to imagine China making greater progresses then anyone else.

(who is most likely from a 'first world' nation)\n\n2. Copycat points out that the 'middle classes' of 'first world' ie (majority western) nations pollute far more per person.\n\n3. I say Copycat should be careful because people like 1. don't like to be shown how hypocritical they are.\n\n4. You start wailing on 2 + 3 then bizarrely ask for information on who pollutes more per capita and for how long they have done so, which when you research, will simply reinforce what 2 + 3 are talking about. Ie Western Nations have polluted for longer and more per capita until something like 2009 when China took over in Carbon emissions at least.\n\n5. wtf you even chattin bout?"

aS'This is just one example. Another way in which they don\'t *really* play by the rules is with their currency valuation. Most currencies in the world are "free floating" in that market demand for them can increase or decrease their value. \n\nChina practiced currency devaluation for many years by purchasing huge amounts of foreign currency and debt. This kept the value of the currency artificially low, which kept the prices of their goods around the world very low. This is called a "pegged" currency because the government picked a value and kept it there through externally influencing the currency market.\n\nMore recently, they have switched to a "controlled peg" in which the value of the currency is allowed to "float" within a certain bracket, but it is controlled through the same means as in the pegged system from exceeding the boundaries of that bracket. Still controlled, but less so, and only at the margins.\n\nThere\'s lots of other ways in which the Chinese economy is falsely propped up, which is why there is a lot of talk about the Chinese bubble collapse. When you see lots of Chinese money in foreign countries buying up property and assets, it\'s not because they are trying to expand economically, necessarily. It\'s because anyone who has seen the guts of how that economy works from the inside knows it won\'t last and wants to get their puffed up Chinese money that they made through various forms of corruption, graft and favoritism into a real economy that is based on real rules. \n\nIt\'s like pouring hot air into a balloon and then trading it for a helium balloon. Once the hot air cools, the balloon will sink - but the Chinese guy doesn\'t care because he traded it for a shiny helium balloon that will float forever.'

In the mean time lets rage on how we are being held down every day by the corpratocracy independently of the TPP.\n\n&gt;Why should I be afraid of some Chinese families building decent houses with electricity, air conditioning, clean water, food, medicine and education for their children anyway?\n\nKind of hyperbole kind of strawman? I am not trying to say the US should keep the Chinese down, I am suggesting having strong trade agreements in place for these economies is good policy to not be hedged out of emerging or growing economies so long as they are mutually beneficial. It is in the interest of the average US citizen to remain the key financial center of the world and I think the US would be wise to retain it if it is ethically feasible. \n\n&gt;There's more than enough natural resources to go around.\n\nNot rare earth metals, of which China holds nearly 97%. \n\n&gt;I'd rather we focus on those kinds of problems, quit playing stupid games trying to make sure the other guy doesn't get to have the same kinds of things we have.\n\nI agree to a point. However, I see what kind of positive gains can be made from economic warfare as opposed to actual warfare. Look at Russia turing suddenly expansionist within the last few years. I believe the US leveraged OPEC and its own oil interests to destabilize the price of oil. Thus seriously crippling the Russian economy and preventing further expansion into Ukraine. Now, this could have happened by chance, but I strongly feel based on the illogical actions of OPEC that it was by design."

The united states/ particularly the canadian oil sector is being affected just as much if not more than the russians. Though I would not put it past the u.s. to hack off a finger(their oil industry) to save a leg(halting Russian expansion), I think with how much of a vested interest the elite have in the oil industry that if they had any leverage with opec they would have used it to prop prices up instead\n\n|Not rare earth metals, of which China holds nearly 97%\n\nI was under the impression they don't actually hold 97% of the rare earth metals, rather they flooded the market for several years making it unprofitable to mine these metals in other countries, once those other countries mining industry was destroyed they cut their output so they could enjoy the profit (very similar to the game opec is playing right now)"

The 1951 Soviet argument and the supposed limited ratification does not alter the point that historical claims are not generally grounds for acceptance under UN treaty.  The fact remains that, under UNCLOS, China agreed explicitly to the principle that territorial disputes shall be resolved by multilateral negotiation and arbitration - not building sand castles, making threats over the radio, and physically intimidating those smaller than you.\n\nThe book you cite discusses only the late- and post-colonial activities in the area 1930-1956.  There is nothing in there that seems to have any relevance, other than noting that nobody after the war really wanted to spend money defending the islands for little apparent gain.\n\nThe plain fact is that these islands have been uninhabited throughout history.  As such, there is no justification for sovereignty other than the existing rules under UNCLOS and related treaties that have been well accepted by all nations (including China with regard to several other territorial disputes) - i.e. the 12 mile territorial zone, etc.'

Now, their urbanization is coming from regional consolidation (changing the paperwork, so a few "village" government merge into a city, or a city and the outlying suburbs are merged into a bigger city).\n\nChinese house prices are flat or dropping.

aS'Actually this is false, China construction to GDP percentage is significantly lower then the Western world. So while you see a lot going on here, mind you it\'s a massive country, it\'s still less then the West. This could partly be explained that you get in the end here due cheap materials/labour/development more money for your buck.\n\nFurther I see here a lot of strange ideas about China and construction. You always here about ghost cities and such. I think it\'s important first to understand "real estate" is a big market, even bigger because it\'s China. What happens in Beijing isn\'t the same as in some second/third tier city as Maoming South China. Even Beijing it\'s fucking huge. Then consider real estate is a lot, not just residential but also commercial and offices.\n\nWhile China certainly is something to be worried about, Li Ka Sjing (HK wealthiest developer) pulls back out of all commercial and office space.* Residential on the other hand he still is going strong in it. It makes sense because China it\'s vast and still hundreds of millions of people are expected to migrate to the city. Empty blocks today will be full in the near future. Combine that with a strong government which does a lot to change the market into something more affordable it\'s not unthinkable it\'s still all fine. The government for example puts restrictions on expensive projects but also forces developers to merge to improve their liquidity. That said there are still developers in perile here, some due corruption, some due shitty projects, some because they were forced into shitty projects by the government. Synocism keeps track of developments and every once in a while he has an article on the property market and current trend in the T40 seems that most prices are flat or even going down, slightly. Then again, China is big, even cities. I live in a city of 17 million people so while maybe the outskirts drop massive in price, the CBD is still very strong.\n\n*Office space on the other hand is really worrysome. I\'m a developer/construction guy in the finance world myself. Back home even a shitty office we would demand 150 euro/m2 bare and here I got my office in a top location, the IFC and I pay less then 30 euro/m2 and as a foreign company I\'m convinced we still get fucked. Even so, the building less then 100.000m2 out of 250.000m2 is filled and at the same time hundreds of offices are being build including infront of me which is double size. It really makes no sense. Same for commercial space, they aren\'t super expensive but for the market alright, but the landlords here have the tendency to simply screw over the tenants when they can in hope for a new one after. It\'s a messed up market.\n\nI think the market here still has plenty of space, and while the growth might be out of it (cement production is flat for years) and there are certain problems to overcome it\'s not a market as dire as some like to believe.'

aS'&gt; Ghost cities are a myth. \n\n"Ghosts" are a myth, yeah, sure. Cities that remain completely empty and are now beginning to fall into disrepair are *not* a myth. \n\nThere was a book published about the whole situation just a few weeks ago, titled "[Ghost Cities of China: The Story of Cities without People in the World\'s Most Populated Country](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghost-Cities-China-Populated-Arguments/dp/178360218X). It actually puts the situation in a slightly more positive light, but even it admits that the Ghost cities are a problem.\n\nCNN just did a piece on China\'s ghost cities [just a couple months ago.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/19/world/gallery/china-tianjin-ghost-city/)\n\n&gt; It generally takes between 10-15 years for them to reach decent occupancy.\n\nThat doesn\'t make any sense. Brand new homes and buildings begin to fall into disrepair after a couple years. They need upkeep and maintenance. Anyone who says that has never worked in construction before. And that\'s in the west where the build quality is higher. I can\'t even begin to imagine what a Chinese house would look like after 10-15 years with little maintenance. \n\n&gt; www.bullionstar.com/blogs/koos-jansen/guest-post-5-chinese-ghost-cities-came-alive/\n\nWell of course some filled up. That was inevitable. Nobody expected every single one of them to remain empty forever. But there are dozens upon dozens, if not *hundreds* of these ghost cities all around China. Just 5 of them filling up is actually less than I thought.\n\n&gt; They\'re filling about as quickly as is possible.\n\nNo, they\'re not. Worse, they\'re counting that as part of the GDP growth. That will have horrendous affects on their economy when it all comes to ahead. They might very well be worse off than when they started. When things are not looking so good for other countries\' economies, they do all they can to mitigate the fall out. China is basically doing the opposite of mitigation. When the shit hits the fan (and it will, no economy can grow forever, it\'s impossible) they\'re going to fall hard.\n'

Because they\'re pretty fucking ok with how things have turned out!\n\n\n&gt;Just because Bush got away with it and has yet to be punished doesn\'t mean we allow a free for all for everyone else.\n\nOf course not! YOU\'RE saying this again, not me. You\'re putting words and sentiments on the table that i don\'t share in order to ter them down and "win". What crap. Angain these are YOUR sentiments, not mine. Just like this:\n\n&gt; Maybe we should let China have Tibet you know so everyone feels happy\n\nWhich makes no sense from my point of view and is illogical as fuck. \n\nEDIT: you know what\'s hilarious? 1. The time i spent "defending" the US\'s actions in iraq from people who go to the other extreme. They aren\'t very different from you, they are just from "the other side". 2. That you try to write it off as just bush. But it wasn\'t: it *was* America. I know several marines who served there and were proud to be doing so and felt it was entirely justified "because Saddam". Now they\'re all really quiet and some blame bush too. But it was you *as a nation*. And i really really don\'t feel you\'ve learnt from it. It\'s most probable that you\'ll repeat the same thing in the next 50 years (to be fair that\'s actually very good behaviour for a hegemon, considering how badly just about every other one in history has behaved.)'

aS"&gt;im from new zealand not the US\n\nThen you've got an extra big helping of talking through your hat going on.\n\n&gt;im basing all of this on US fighting china with no other countries intervention. if you want to make it a more realistic scenario, think about what russia would like to do if china and america had themselves a nice big war. \n\nYou mean the Russia that has been threatening the US with Nuclear attack for the last year? The one that is allying with China to establish an investment bank to try and undercut the US Dollar as the world trade currency and replace it with the yuan?  The Russia whose largest petro customer is now China?  The Russia whose fondest desire is the destruction of NATO, and who will be conducting joint military exercises with China?  Gee, I wonder who they'll side with.\n\n&gt; taking chinese territory while china's power was arrayed against the US would be an excellent move, as the chinese cant fight on two fronts against those two nations. \n\nIt is by no means a given that Russia wouldn't side with China\n\nRussia doesn't want Chinese territory, Russia wants European territory.\n\n&gt;china will pretty much certainly be the aggressor, \n\nNot if history since 1952 is any indicator.\n\n&gt;so russia has rock solid reasoning to get involved. thats a lot of territory and resources to be had, and don't think for a second they wont go for it.\n\nAgain, Russia does not want Chinese territory more than it wants European territory.  It is by no means a given that they won't side *with* China.\n\n&gt; also, the US allies will reinforce them,\n\nLess certain than ever, since Iraq and Afghanistan, especially if the US starts it, as demonstrated last year by the UK concerning Syria.\n\n&gt; japan is the perfect place to launch long range bombing and missile attacks.\n\nWhich is currently under going a popular movement to force US airbases out of the country.\n\n &gt;India's position, right on the chinese border, and their disposition towards china, will all most certainly bring them into the war as well, opening up a third front. \n\nIn what way is that certain?  \n\n&gt; you take the 4 most powerful nations, and pit three of them against one,attacking that one from three directions. china has no fucking chance in hell.\n\nBut there is nothing that says it would happen that way but your conjecture.  It's just as likely Russia will side with China against it's historical nemesis, and that India will decide it's aims of realizing itself as a superpower are best served by staying out of it.\n\n&gt;also, the US have anti-ship and anti-air missiles and silkworm batteries do not have the range necessary to engage carrier groups,  \n\n Ship based ones do.  And the land based batteries can reach ships that are at bombardment range- no FO + no satellite guidance means ships will have to close on targets to engage them.\n\n&gt;and torpedo boats are vulnerable to air attacks, \n\nYou don't seem to understand how hard it is to hit a moving target from a moving airplane over an ocean...\n\n&gt;with all those carriers with long range attack capability, torpedo boats will find themselves under attack before they can engage. \n\n... Or how hard it is to hit a moving target from a moving boat when you're shooting at something you can only see on radar.\n\n&gt; air attacks against carrier groups will have limited success, as the groups have good anti-air defense and can utilize the carrier based aircraft as well. \n\nNeither Aegis nor Phalanx actually work particularly well, and even if they did,  the Chinese tactic is saturation.  It only takes one exocet to sink a cruiser or destroyer.  As for the carrier based aircraft, the US Navy currently has no air superiority fighter at all- the Tomcats are gone, and as said before, the F-22,and F-35 are sucking hind tit in a big way and will continue to do so for years to come.\n\n&gt;awith the amount of aircraft carriers china has, they have to use land based craft, giving them much less offensive flexibility,they simply cant bring enough firepower at once to cripple a carrier group without losing most of what they attack with or failing altogether. \n\nThis analysis is based on what?  It isn't history or demonstrated capabilities, so what is it?\n\n&gt;these groups can stay outside of effective Chinese naval engagement range, and use SLBMs to effectively engage land targets from outside of chinese land based defense system range.\n\nNot without FOs or satellite guidance they can't.  Without those things, the tomahawk might as well be a catapult flinging rocks.\n\n&gt; if china wants to attack a carrier group they have to leave land based defense behind,\n\nNo, they don't.\n\n&gt; without land based aircraft their navy stands no chance of overcoming the US much more mobile and varied defenses. \n\n...which are no more mobile than China's and demonstrably not that effective.\n\n"

aS'Do you honestly think they are just as English as you are? Imagine a scenario where the English economy collapses and everyone looses their jobs, while the Indian economy booms and becomes the new China. Do you think that these English Indians will think twice before moving to India? They will go there and everyone will treat them like indians and after a while they will fit right in. Meanwhile, you would be stuck in England, perhaps trying to immigrate somewhere else. If you did choose to leave, lets say to india, you would be viewed as a complete foreigner, unlike your english indian friends who would fit in. \n\nThe point being that your culture and ancestry is a lot more difficult to lose than you might think. Sure, asians in England might speak english and embrace english culture, but they will always still be aware of their ancestry and cultural heritage. Just take a look at jews and romani. They have been in Europe for hundreds of years and have still never completely assimilated. They have come very close to doing so, but have not. \n\nEngland suffers from the same problems as the states do and its all because of immigration. If an immigrant is shot by police people start asking right away if it was because of the colour of his skin. Of course no one should be shot because of their ethnicity, but in homogenous societies the question is never asked because their is only one ethnicity, one people, and no ethnic tensions. And when different people live together, there is always tension. Just take a look at the former yugoslavia, Lebanon, or Israel. Take a look at Sri Lanka were an ethnic minority (Tamils) went to war, actually trying to carve out a piece of the country even though many of them were 2nd generation migrants that came from southern India.   \n\nSeriously, England lets in so many worthless immigrants who just want to receive government benefits and to sleep with English women.

aS"&gt;In point of fact, ISIS attracts young men of all stripes, whether economically disenfranchised or not\n\nI actually don't know as much as I'd like about Daesh's demographics, other than that it's predominantly men from the Levant, supplemented with Caucus mercenaries and a small percentage of European/Americans. This is backed up by numbers given by the [CIA/UN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ISIL#Troops_in_Iraq_and_Syria); showing around 15k foreign members, most of which are from Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. I'm making a leap by assuming the people coming from poorer countries are, themselves, poor, but I think that's about as good as estimates get.\n\n&gt;Were this the key element behind the formation of such an organization, we would expect to find equally vehement groups gaining strength and even taking power in the many regions of the world\n\nBut we do. Boko Haram has made the news lately as a Daesh-like force in Africa. Hamas (while older) engages in more traditional terrorism, but maintains a similar set of enemies as Daesh (even though they consider Daesh their enemy) and uses similarly callous tactics, the Uyghurs in northern China / India have been growing in strength, and there are dozens of smaller brigades that arise independently but have recently pledged themselves in service of Daesh. Daesh in the Levant may stand out as a more stunning example because of it's history, but the things that cause it to rise as a force in the first place are not unique.\n\nI agree that religion may be one tool to retain troops and justify brutality - it's always a good way to tempt people into suppressing doubt.

aS"You've consistently avoided engaging any of the arguments I've made, instead contenting yourself to belittle them without offering any sort of substance. So I will say this: economics as a discipline is bankrupt. It is in no way scientific and lacks any real explanatory power. It makes wild assumptions about human nature and physical reality that are easily contradicted. At it's worst it the pseudo-academic legitimation of horrifically violent government policy. The murder of thousands of innocents in Argentina has the implicit approval of the ideology of Milton Friedman and those advising Pinochet's regime. \n\nA whole slew of economists are now coming out in support of Keynesian economics and a return to fiscal policy. Even the IMF of all groups is saying we should reconsider Keynes. It is overwhelmingly clear that capitalism exists between the poles of a demand crisis, like the one we are now in and was previously exemplified by the Great Depression era, and of a supply crisis like was experienced in the 1970s. \n\nIt is hard to ignore the fact that this is something that Karl Marx conjectured more than one hundred fifty years ago. He has a far better explanatory record than any mainstream economist, yet we ignore that because it is politically inconvenient.\n\nIt is ironic that you would accuse me of having a narrow view of the world when I am advocating explicitly that we connect all the dots and look at the world as a whole. By themselves, the last eleven US presidents being war criminals, top soil being depleted at a breakneck pace with deserts expanding into human settlement, global warming threatening to collapse global ecosystems, countries all over the world engaging in mass surveillance and lurching closer and closer to a police state, or China using half the world's concrete production to build cities that no one will ever live in can all be dismissed as aberration. But you can't write off all of these, and all the other problems we face. At this point it is hard to conclude that an unwillingness to engage on systemic level is anything other than politically motivated sophistry."

aS"&gt;If there's another recession, it actually doesn't mean they all shut down. They've all survived in the past.\n\nI didn't argue that they'd shut down.  Still, if we could minimize the number of people hurt by a recession, or more quickly redirect resources and capital in the midst of one (because even a completely free market system will have recessions)... shouldn't we?  Wouldn't it be better to hurt fewer people?  Wouldn't it be better to NOT cause or exacerbate recessions through bad government policy in the first place?\n\n&gt;Every country has their own military. Because it isn't as large as their own doesn't mean anything.\n\nYes, it does.\n\n&gt;I actually wish no country had such a large military.\n\nYou and the rest of the world.  Unfortunately, as we've seen with Bush's America and Putin's Russia, there are countries out there that are happy to use the barrel of a gun to get what they want.  It's that Europe benefits from looking the other way from the U.S. military, and Putin wouldn't dare fuck with Europe as long as the U.S. military stands at it's side.  \n\nFurther, you'll argue that you wish no country had such a large military, but you're clearly in favor of supporting a huge institution of force that will see to it that your way is implemented.  If there were no police to haul away doctors and businessmen working against the laws of your system, they would freely be able to just ignore your regulations.  Does that network of force come for free?  Or do those agents require guns, a paycheck, armor, prisons, etc?\n\n&gt;I think that money could have been spent on giving everyone healthcare and basics like food and shelter.\n\nI don't.  The USSR tried that.  China tried that.  It failed.  Hundreds of millions died.  But you undoubtedly live in a country that, at least partially, employs the forces of markets.  Where you can strike out on your own to make a good life for yourself, and it just so happens that countries that do this, *even just a little bit*, are the richest in the world.  Their *poor* live a life that is the envy of the rest of the world.\n\n&gt;We can provide these things to everyone. Its been done around the world and the rest of us are already enjoying it. If you don't think its that important of a goal or you don't like the concept of having to pay into a pool for everyone to receive, thats fair enough, your opinion. But it can and does work.\n\nI don't think it can *persist*.  There's no question it can work.

Vietnam were building artificial islands on reefs for several years now. Yet somehow when China builds these things after Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines, the US sent warships and spy planes into the region to "ensure freedom of navigation".\n\nOne notes that these waters are where ~90% of China\'s maritime trade routes goes through, carrying vital commodities like oil and food, and as such are strategically vulnerable. If any incident (no matter who caused it) disrupted trade in the area, China would be affected the most. The question now is: why would China do anything to harm freedom of navigation in the region? Perhaps they believe it was more in their interests than doing nothing?\n\nAnother fact is that the US has made it a common strategy to deploy sanctions/embargoes on its rivals, i.e. China in the past, Cuba, Iran, and Russia today. The US is NOT a signatory of the UNCLOS, again citing freedom of navigation. China and the Philippines when signing UNCLOS expressly stated that existing disputes (like the SCS) do not fall under the treaty. So are those warships really there to enforce freedom of navigation?\n\nJapan\'s dispute with China is not in the South China Sea, and involve a difference in interpretation over WWII surrender terms for territories. The recent CIA declassified report on the Sino-Indian war placed the blame more on India for provoking war, and the dispute was a historical leftover from the colonial era.\n\nWithout US presence, China has generously settled 17 of 23 territorial disputes with its neighbours, giving away more than 50% of its total claims.\n\nSo yes, really.'

A reasonable person afflicted with the horrific psychological disease of Islam can still be quite reasonable and a productive member of society. If you have recently seen "A Beautiful Mind" and read about the death of John Nash you might understand.\n\nHowever the underlying roots are simply barbarism. Because they have oil we sell them roads and modern techologies so they look advanced but as a society and culture they are not. They are cargo cult. You cannot slap roads and modern infrastructure in place or democracy and expect instant miracles. It takes generations of cultural adaptation and it\'s that which made our western societies great ones with modern technology, infrastructure and societal systems or values like secular systems, democracy, equal rights. It\'s not the other way around. I think people mix cause and effect too easily. Definition of people in the middle east or other parts of the developing world: More often than not, cave men in suits.\n\nThat\'s the true definition of a developing society but the middle east manages to hide it the most because big oil means they can buy a lot of suits.

Both sides are unwilling to compromise in strategic purposes, then tactically, Washington will draw closer to a tipping point. The trend will lead to a dangerous outcome if China does not and will not allow excessive concessions. Thus, it is essential that both sides should show their bottom lines to each other, and see if one can respect the other on these.\n\n&gt; For China, one bottom line is that the reclamation of these islands must be finished no matter what.

Imagine if, fifty years, ago, China conquered America (or wherever you live) and decided that the area you live in is now part of Mexico, and you happen to disagree with the way Mexicans run things. If you were in a shitty situation today, would you take personal responsibility for it, or blame China for ruining any chance of having a functional nation state?\n\nAdditionally, it isn't as if they have had 70 years to freely advance themselves. Especially during the Cold War, foreign powers have constantly backed dictators throughout the Middle East, always preventing the people from expressing their own ideas as to how they ought to govern.

The US pushed them out of the south and then kept going, but only had around 160k troops in korea at the time.\n\nChina invaded with over 1.3 million troops and the US stalemated with them for a while until a peace deal was reached.\n\nAt any point the US could have used nuclear weapons to end the Chinese, at any point the US could have fully entered the war and mobilized and crushed the Chinese, it was a small force of UN soldiers protecting SK.\n\nIt also basically a surprise attack by the Chinese.\n\nThe only real goal of the Korean war was to protect SK, which as you can see clearly happened.\n\nOnly Chinese delusion and historical revisionism can claim otherwise.'

aS"yeah, so they beat north korea who attacked south korea, but they lost to china who came to defend north korea. What's the problem?\n\nsaying US defeated China in Korean war is like saying Greece defeated Germany because they defeated Italy, in WW2 - thats not what happened, Greece pushed back Italian forces and began taking territory, but then the Germans came and put a stop to that. It wasnt Germany who lost, it was Italy and Greece, in that order - in this case, North Korea lost and then the US lost."

aS"Strategic purpose.\n\nAlso, this China (PRC) have been talking Taiwan, Tibet, and South China Sea as the three core interests since they took power. Losing one of the core interests is risking losing all of them. \n\nBy the way, the reason China wants Taiwan and Tibet is also strategic propose. The reason US initially took interest and support in Taiwan back in the day is also due to strategic interest.\n\nTaiwan serves as the jump off point for anyone that want to attack coastline of China from the pacific ocean. The coastline of China is arguably the most important part of China. Taiwan can also serve as the defense line against outside attacks.\n\nTibet is the high ground that over looks the plains of China. Also Tibet due to it's height makes a easy defense position, for both attacker and China. Therefore, whoever, gains Tibet or influence in Tibet can mount a long term assault into China easily or serve as a wall to hold of attack.\n\nSouth China Sea due to the geography (low ocean depth) is a natural hiding place for submarines, this makes South China Sea a easy place to defend. Much like Tibet and Taiwan, whoever control this area will have a much easily time defending or attacking China. It is also where all China's trade goes through."

aS'you should read more history, the original goal was to protect SK, but then the general commanding the US forces in Korea basically went rogue and attacked NK which wasn\'t part of the plan, but the president didn\'t exactly stop him either.\n\nAfter this happened the Chinese attacked full force and won, US being outnumbered or being far away is all details that don\'t change what happened.\n\nChina outnumbered US forces sure, thats because it has a land border and the US doesn\'t - thats what happens when you fight a war 1000\'s of km away vs someone who fights a war in neighboring country and pretending that thats not fair is just stupidity, thats why now in Ukraine nobody could defeat Russia militarily without using WMD\'s because the logistics just make that much of a difference, every tank the west might send to Ukraine, Russia can send in 100 tanks for the same cost.\n\nthe US didnt want to escalate the fight with China because then the USSR would step in and it would go WW3, they couldnt win with what they had so they negotiated a deal based on "we cant win without ww3 escalation" which is still a loss, its just not a unconditional capitulation like at the end of WW2. If they knew China would fight them they probably wouldnt have invaded, likewise they didn\'t expect Russia to fight them in Ukraine and they know they cant win, but they dont want to retreat and look weak.'

aS'Well, I think that RizzMustBolt was hoping to celebrate the decline of fossil fuels, as our primary energy source, and celebrate the rise of solar power instead. \n\nHowever, it appears that RizzMustBolt, might be slightly ahead of schedule in that regard.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nFor now, we still need to rely heavily upon fossil fuels, and I believe the USA should continue to supplement their fossil fuels from Canadian sources rather than Saudi Arabian sources. \n\nIn fact, that is exactly what the USA is already doing: Canada now supplies MORE oil to the USA, than even Saudi Arabia. \n\nThis also makes Canada the LARGEST trading partner of the USA, and not China -- China is in second place.\n\nThis is surprising to many Americans, as many believe that China is the largest trading partner of the USA, and that Saudi Arabia is the largest oil supplier to the USA... but again, Canada is in 1st place in both of those categories... \n\nwhich is probably a great thing, considering how much Canada shares with the USA, in terms of values and culture, as compared to Saudi Arabia and China which have some rather striking value differences/conflicts with the USA.\n\nSo ya, I personally believe it is better to send US money to Canada, rather than China/Saudi Arabia.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBut back to the main point of RizzMustBolt: in the end it\'s probably better for America to keep it\'s money at home, and rely on solar power, rather than sending that money, even to Canada!\n\nAnd that day is likely coming. Perhaps sooner than we suspect.\n\nThe amount of solar energy that strikes the Earth ever hour is staggering... and will go MUCH FURTHER than fossil fuels, once we perfect solar energy, and it becomes more widespread.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nSo while I can\'t put words in RizzMustBolt\'s mouth... if I am not mistaken, I think that is what RizzMustbolt wants to celebrate: complete energy independence, and not "unemployment" and "high gas prices" as you might have accidentally misinterpreted.\n'

I never denied that it is disputed territory, but in the past it had been advocated by Beijing that the dispute should be resolved in a peaceful manner via dialogue and ongoing negotiations without any party escalating the situation. Back then it was simply small patrol boats circling around each other, now by building a permanent fixture, China is actively upgrading its ability to project its power and give itself a noteworthy advantage to enforce its claim (improved surveillance and patrol capabilities). This puts other contenders for the region in a disadvantage and thus it can be reasonably inferred that China is seeking to 'move things forward' in its favour.\n\n&gt;to protect its vital trade routes for both shipment of its goods, and more importantly, shipments of natural resources to china such as oil.\n\nThat's WW2 era thinking, especially now in the modern Asian region where every country is actively seeking to improve economic growth through growing cooperation. There are general international law providing for free movement at sea. At most a country will stake its claims at the waters for, say, tax/custom purposes, but that runs contrary to the policy of economic growth facilitated by trade, China does not need to do that.\n\nI personally think this alleged 'aggression' is more so the result of China's growing, but misplaced, sense of confidence in its capabilities and supposed status among the Asian powers.

By the time you get back I'll just be sitting on my hospital death bed dying of old age or something related).\n\nSecond, even if Europe as a continent opened up for the very first time to chinese made goods(newsflash, they're already being sold) and ignoring the fact that the first thing to go would be chinese made goods if china got into a war with much of western europe's greatest ally, you'd then be expecting them to magically be able to pick up the slack(which they couldn't at all even as a new market for chinese made goods). And cynnically, all the markets you mentioned already have chinese goods. Do you have any idea how much the entire world would have to spend to pick up the slack and prevent an economic meltdown the likes of which all of Asia wouldn't recover from for decades? Honestly, that's pretty laughable.\n\nAnd while India might not be able to pick up the ridiculously cheap manufacturing market, you do realize you proved my point,right?  China is the world's largest export market, dwarfing indonesia, india and every single other economy in it's same market by a large amount even if they all combined. But let's not ignore thata large part of that is because they export to the US.

I don't know the numbers to be honest, but I imagine a modern carrier full of planes and trained personnel costs dozens of billions to replace. A anti-carrier missiles on the other hand isn't anywhere near the same ballpark. "

Anything that destroys China's economy (instantly?) will do the same damage back on Americas economy.

China also has a weaker economy than the US (China would take a much larger economic hit than the US would) because they're an export based economy and the US is a consumer based economy.\n\nThis is why China is trying to build up their navy right now to match the US navy, because in the event of a war China will basically be blockaded after a while and take massive economic damage."
p2044
aS"The Chinese navy buildup is for two purposes. To serve as a trip wire for the launch of Chinese carrier killers and post carrier killers when there is no more American navy to blockade the USA mainland.\n\nChinese have Russian anti air tech. Russians have the best missiles in the world. USA pilots trying to bomb the Chinese mainland will be dying like flies on a hot plate.\n\nThe Chinese constantly monitor the location of every American carrier frigate destroyer and likely airboat everywhere in the worlds oceans and where their satellites don't cover Russian satellites will. They are not waiting for war to break out them locate targets. They are tracking targets finger on the kill switch right now.\n\nThousands of hypersonic missiles some nuclear tipped will lance out from the Chinese mainland traveling at around Mach ten traveling thousands of miles in minutes and will come down on those carrier groups and blow them to bits before they've even had time to change direction to head towards china.\n\nCarriers are sitting ducks to anyone with missiles.\n USA naval power would be ended in a heartbeat and Chinese gunboats will be in every American port until the USA sues for peace.\n\nNuke your way out? America spends 10 cents per head per year on civil defense. The Russians and Chinese spend 20 USA dollars per head per year. They can shelter their entire populations. Not to mention china and Russia are much larger and much hillier and so nukes won't do was much damage. Also Russia's has more nukes than all NATO combined. In such a nuclear exchange The Chinese and Russian mirvs will pour over the North Pole like a storm and glass every square inch of American soil and kill every living American until even the memory of your nation has been destroyed. Meanwhile the Chinese and Russians survive as a people and as nations.\n\nSo even just china versus America China would win if America was invading china or on its borders. \n\nBut in any such war Russia would stand by china. \n\nThis is why there will never be a war between American and China. There was only ever one war between the two and China tore America a new arsehole in that one and ever since then America has been terrified to face down china.

aS"DF-21D exits the atmosphere in a ballistic trajectory. It's vulnerable to SM-3 Block 1B deployed on Japanese and US Burkes/Kongos. It's only hypersonic on re-entry, and guiding a Mach 10 projectile on a terminal re-entry towards a moving target is fairly difficult and the CEP is fairly large. Trying to hit a carrier, or any ship for that matter, when you have a CEP of 200-400m is laughable. Given the fact that you also need real-time tracking of your target to narrow down location, because even with realtime warhead guidance you still need a fairly small target window. This is something China lacks, and is compounded by the large area that a carrier battlegroup can occupy. Especially within the Pacific, and even within smaller areas like the seas. \n\nDF-21 is fairly similiar to Pershing II which is very similar to the targets used for Aegis BMD, THAAD and GMD intercept testing. \n"

aS'Again, I\'ve already addressed your concern. The links I\'ve provided in my other comments acknowledge the dearth of statistics regarding evolution/creation distribution in developing countries **but** there IS hard data showing the vast majority of the world believes in god. Subscription to evolution has yet to reach even 50% in many first world countries (including the most populated first world country, the USA) so, *as I said before*, I think it\'s a *safe bet* that the majority of the world subscribes to a theistic religion AND some sort of creationist model.  Yeah evolution is gaining ground at a rapid pace throughout the world but for you to say the majority of religious people in the world also subscribe to evolution just tells me you don\'t really have a firm concept of how big the world truly is and how far behind most of its people are in terms of education and development.\n\nNow, does that claim apply to *every* single country in the continents I listed?  Of course not, China being the biggest exception, although claiming all Chinese are evolutionary atheists is [absurd; it\'s a complicated question.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_China#Statistics).  I\'ll concede it to you though just for the sake of the argument. \n\nI think my claim does, however, apply to most of of the people of those three continents. There are over 2 billion Christians, 1.6 billion Muslims, and 1 billion Hindus in the world. You trying to point out individual exceptions that still don\'t account for 50% of the world population (assuming every single one of them was an evolutionary atheist) doesn\'t refute my overall point, nor does regurgitating the same "theism =/= creationism" argument I\'ve already thoroughly addressed.'

aS'a brief overview of the M.E\n\nthere are two major factions in the M.E. Sunni and Shiia. the US backs the Sunni.\nThose Sunni countries being Saudi, Egypt, Kuwait. \nthe Shiia being Iran, Iraq, Syria.\n\nIt\'s all about the ability to control access to the worlds most plentiful source of energy. 50% of the worlds oil is sourced from the M.E.  \n\n[Here\'s a real US policy doc from 1955. Take note of the objectives. Its not mythical. Its there in black and white.  ](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB78/propaganda%20127.pdf)\n\nAmericas number one objective in the Middle East: **The availability to the US and its allies of resources, the strategic positions and the passage rights and the denial of such rights and resources to the soviet block.**\n\nSo in 1955 the US sought to control the Gulf, to have the ability guarantee its access and to deny access to others.  Oil has not become less important in the prevailing 60 years. \n\nFormally the USSR was the rival and was seen off with the help of Israel, ( It was what proved Israels worth to the US ) Iran was a client. Iran is no longer a client and so currently the US would like to prevent the formation of  the a [**Shiia crescent,**](http://bintel.com.ua/uploads/images/2014/vol3.jpg) with Iran at its head. \n\nThis crescent would include the Shiia land in Saudi. This is why Saudi and Iran are implacable enemies. Saudi is a US client for protection against Iran. [**If you look and Shiia land in Saudi**](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w26Pl18fmRY/TzFc-rnckII/AAAAAAAAAMg/z8K_-AuXefQ/s1600/Saudi_shia.jpg) you\'ll note it sits on top of the [**big oil fields**](http://www.reallycoolblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Oil-Gas-Fields-Map.gif). "Find Shiia find oil" is a local saying. The Shiia are the potential rivals to US hegemony in the gulf.  \n\nShould Iran succeed in creating such an entity this would be a genuine threat to Americas passage rights and strategic positions in the  region, which as you will recall is America #1 objective in the M.E.\n\nThe US will seek to control the M.E. so long as oil powers the world. Control of this resource is a major plank in the USA\'s super power status.    \nI don\'t think there is a better ally in this ambition to control the gulf than Israel. Israel is a western enclave in the region, is a regional pariah completely dependent on the US for weapons and coverage from UN sanctions and proven ability to kick arab ass. Who would be better?\n\nIf you view everything in the M.E. through a Sunni/Shiia/Oil lens all becomes clearer.\n\nThe US state dept has called Saudi and the description can be extended to the region [**a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history.**](http://revcom.us/a/090/iran-pt2-en.html)  \n\n[Zbigniew Brzezinski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski) former United States National Security Advisor said America\'s control over the Middle East [**"gives America indirect but politically critical leverage on the European and Asian economies that are also dependent on energy exports from the region."**](http://www.idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/GlobalOilPoliticsandtheEnergySecurityintheAsianregion_JNandakumar_110405) . [George Kennan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan) put is as "Veto power". Truman\'s Secretary of Defense James Forrestal noted that [**whoever sits on the valve of Middle East oil may control the destiny of Europe**](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a916768279&amp;fulltext=713240928) and now Asia. \n\nControl the M.E and you have your foot on the windpipe of the European and Asian economies. relinquishing that control is  unthinkable. (Having permanent military bases in Iraq makes very good sense in this context ) relinquishing control to an Iranian shiia block /China/ Russia is doubly unthinkable. All other potential rivals have to figure Americas control of the oil flow into their calculations. The USA controls the oil. If the USA decides, say China, will not be getting M.E. oil then it can stop the flow. China knows this, the USA knows this. Thus before things get violent China will have to back down. ( China used for example only ) \n\nBTW China is taking steps strengthen the sea route from the Gulf to China, [**the string of pearls naval ports**](\nhttp://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/string-of-pearls1.jpg)\n\nOn the Petro$: The Shiia would not use the petro$. The use of the petro$ means that the US can print dollars to pay for price increases in oil. Industrialized countries without oil, such as Japan EU or China, have to export to the US in order to obtain dollars to exchange for Opec oil; for example, cars in the case of Japan. So America gets oil and services and goods (eg cars) in exchange for pieces of paper. Not only that but Opec\'s excess dollars were then reinvested in the US and other industrialized countries, thus funding the US budget deficit and reducing US interest rates.\n\nIt would be a massive blow to lose the petrodollar. The value of the $ would plunge, the PetroEuro would rise. The Europeans would plunder US assets.\n\n\nTL:DR if you look at any conflict in the M.E. look at the sides, Shiia and Sunni, I\'ll find the US will back the Sunni as they have oil and use the Petro$\n\n'

aS"Russia has been very weary of giving any kind of military technology to China since the 60's.  Russia and China will provide logistical aid to each other, but Russia giving China any kind of advanced military technology would be very surprising.  Russia and China have not gotten along well historically because of Russia's paranoia over China's ambitions.  When Russia does give military technology to China it's usually outdated.  Most Chinese weapons are Russian knock offs that have been reversed engineered either from captured weapons, or from old technology given to them by Russia.  As far as I know, the only thing that China has been able to make on their own that is of any value are their new tanks and their diesel subs and it took them decades to get it right. \n\nI would be shocked if Russia gave China the ability to produce advanced naval, jet, or missile technology.  Even if Russia did give China the ability to build advanced Russian weapons, the Chinese would actually have to set up an infrastructure to build them, they'd have to do it right, they'd have to do it quickly, and they'd have to train their people how to build and use this new technology.  You don't just learn that overnight.   They'd also have to get all their materials either from inside their own country or overland from Russia.  Russia is not going to start sinking US ships that are seizing Chinese cargo ships.  I seriously doubt Russia would get involved at all.  They'd probably see it as an opportunity to weaken China while simultaneously selling them gas and outdated military equipment for exorbitant prices.    "

p2058
aS"The US would never pour cruise missiles into the Chinese coast.  The US just has to stop all shipping going into and out of China.  Almost all of China's economy relies on shipping.  The US doesn't even have to get close to the Chinese coast.  They can sit out around the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and behind Taiwan and just seize cargo ships.  Not to mention, who is China going to export goods to?  Who will buy their stuff?  They'd have no economy.  Most of the stuff they sell goes to the US and Europe. The US could just sit back and strangle them economically."

The US could just sit back and strangle them economically.\n\nDon't you see that you contradict yourself? US will be hit HARD by this, and we're talking 1932 level hard, unless they start to change their economy now. Imagine all the wares from China not arriving anymore, and everything worth, say, 30-40% more? US will be dealt a less severe blow, but would it matter to the general populace? The party that would lead the country in a Depression will commit political suicide, will your politicians be ready to do that just to piss off China instead of profiting from it?\n\n&gt;Not to mention, who is China going to export goods to? \n\nIt's not like Europe and US are the only places on Earth. Yes, profit margins will be slimmer, yes, Chinese explosive growth will become a thing of the past, but do you REALLY think that only US/EU can buy things? They are simply preferred wealthy customers, not the only customers.\n\nOf course, China will be hit harder. Of course, US can retool their economy easier.

We're talking about a situation where China takes an island in the South China Sea from a US ally, or does something aggressive which causes the US to blockade China, and then China starts waging war.  At that point there would be threats of nuclear war and the world slips right back into the cold war and the 1960's dynamic returns.  Russia and China trade with their allies, and the US and Europe trades with theirs.  The US already won the first cold war, and I'm pretty sure the US and Europe are very confident they can win another.  \n\n&gt;Don't you see that you contradict yourself? US will be hit HARD by this, and we're talking 1932 level hard, unless they start to change their economy now. Imagine all the wares from China not arriving anymore, and everything worth, say, 30-40% more? US will be dealt a less severe blow, but would it matter to the general populace? The party that would lead the country in a Depression will commit political suicide, will your politicians be ready to do that just to piss off China instead of profiting from it?\n\nThere is cheap labor all over the world, and the US could weather the shitty economy better than China could.  Everyone in the world will have a shitty economy, and the staying power of the US economy has been proven over and over again.  \n\n&gt;It's not like Europe and US are the only places on Earth. Yes, profit margins will be slimmer, yes, Chinese explosive growth will become a thing of the past, but do you REALLY think that only US/EU can buy things? They are simply preferred wealthy customers, not the only customers.\nOf course, China will be hit harder. Of course, US can retool their economy easier. But both countries would suffer greatly, and it's not like their adversaries will be sleeping.\n\nNo one is going to want to get on the bad side of the US, especially when the US controls the banking sector, and when the US economy will recover faster than China and be more stable.  Who is going to buy anything from China if it means getting the US on your bad side and you can just buy shit from India or Africa? "

Naturally, the US have never once worried about "freedom of navigation" during this time.\n\n2) The US actually SUPPORTED this dotted-line claim (and Chiang Kaishek) by outright rejecting the Philippines\' attempt to annex the Spratlys, by citing how their former colony did not include the islands as part of its territories when ownership was handed over to the US by Spain.\n\n3) Both China and the Philippines are signatories of UNCLOS while the United States is not. However, both countries publicly stated it does not apply to existing disputed areas, i.e. the South China Sea.\n\n4) China\'s building of military facilities / airstrips in the region FOLLOWS several years of Vietnam artificial island construction &amp; military facilities building, the Philippines having their own airstrip and a makeshift "base" in the form of a warship ran ashore, and the Taiwanese stationed at Taiping island which also has an airstrip. In fact, China is the last of the major claimants to do this.\n\n5) Disputed territories are not "sovereign territories". By pretty much every measure China/Taiwan\'s claim is stronger than the others: they have the oldest historical claims, they are the "most active claimant", they are the "earliest effective occupant", they were the designated party to receive Japan\'s surrender of the islands, and China was the one who contested French claims back in the colonial era.\n\nDo your homework.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea#19th_century'

Japan would even come and play.  Identifying and destroying the launch sites of the DF-21s would be a top priority, along with reducing China's maritime strike capability in general.  There's a reason the F-35 has a frontal radar cross section equivalent to that of the B-2.\n\nAny aircraft or ship within range of these battle groups (with Aegis and Carrier aircraft that's a 500+ mile-wide dome) would be destroyed; China doesn't have the tech to go toe-to-toe for more than 1 round.

Uncertainty around the indigenisation programme, the perceived lack of a free press, the possibility of abandoning the US dollar as official currency, and political uncertainty flowing the end of the government of national unity with the MDC as well as power struggles within ZANU-PF have increased concerns that the countrys economic situation could further deteriorate.\n\nIn April 2014 Chinamasa admitted that the country was heavily in debt and that the country desperately needed to come up with policies to attract foreign direct investment. Officially Zimbabwe's debt is $7 billion or over 200% of the country's GDP however this figure is disputed with figures as high as $11 billion being quoted once debts to other African countries and China are included.

And to repeat myself "they are concerned about the Chinese showing no interest in using international venues of arbitration in settling maritime territorial disputes with America\'s treaty allies." China promotes its claims using coast guard and PLA Navy vessels, the Philippines attempts to do so through [international arbitration and mediation mechanisms](http://www.cnas.org/sites/default/files/publications-pdf/CNAS%20Yung%20McNulty%20Maritime5_for%20web_0.pdf). China has few allies in the region because they see themselves as superior, they\'ve almost [said as much](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/magazine/82211/china-foreign-policy) at ASEAN. They bribed the annual chair, Cambodia, with economic investment in order for them not to allow a joint statement be released by ASEAN on the issue of the maritime disputes, the first time in the entire history of the organization that ASEAN has failed to issue a closing communique. It is also makes complete sense to put 60% of the fleet in the region because of the trillions of dollars of water borne trade there that also affects the American economy, and which happens to be proximate to the world\'s largest ocean. It also makes sense because there are five American treaty allies, most of the world\'s population,and most of the world\'s emerging economies. It is also the most militarized region in the world, it is the center of the gravity for the global arms trade, and most nations in the region have rapidly increased the pace of modernization and size of their navies in recent years. It is no secret that this part of the world is more important than the Middle East overall, but two protracted conflicts in the region along with tension with Iran had dominated the demand for American military assets for more than a decade. The Asia-Pacific would have clearly dominated strategic focus and resources of the beginning of the 21st century if not for 9/11. This is the difference between a rebalance and containment. '

Sure, you have homeless people in the U.S barely sustaining themselves, but the sheer scope of it in those African countries are just on a completely different level. \n\nOne of the biggest issues with China\'s pollution is that we can\'t really get accurate reports since China is notoriously secretive when it comes to its own public image.

It is common knowledge that the US say one thing and do another, and the fact is that both China analysts and Chinese officials themselves believe that the US is pursuing a containment strategy against China. Even Henry Kissinger mentioned it.\n\nYou on the other hand believe that any time anyone has anything good to say about China, they are bribed. Did Vietnam bribed the Western media to ignore them when they were building artificial islands, military facilities and airstrips? Malaysia stated outright that they have no problems with PLA patrols despite also disputing the SCS and "your enemies are not my enemies", are they bribed too? Hell, is everyone in ASEAN apart from Vietnam and Philippines "bribed" by Chinese investment? Oh wait, it\'s called diplomacy and seeking your own self-interest. Vietnam and the Philippines are the loudest claimants, and the other countries won\'t risk poor relations with their major trading partner up north for someone else.\n\n~90% of the ships passing through the straits are bound for China, sir. The Chinese aren\'t going to disrupt "freedom of navigation" there since any disruption in the region is going to hurt them the most. The US on the other hand has a history of forcing embargoes, trade sanctions and blockades against its rivals, and this region is only in the interest of the US because they can pressure China by blocking it.\n\nAs for "few allies", didn\'t stop China being one of the largest trading partners of most of its neighbours, didn\'t stop those countries joining the AIIB, didn\'t stop Chinese investment into local infrastructure.'

aS'You have it backwards.\n\nChina actually has much more rigerous environmental laws on the books than the US but because of China\'s government structure, enforcing them is hell.\n\nThere is a ton of nepotism and lack of oversight amongst party Cadres and because of this enforcing environmental protections just doesn\'t happen most the time.\n\nHow party Cadres rise through the ranks of the party is by meeting "priority, hard, and soft targets". Priority targets are things like quelling protests.  If your county/township has no social unrest that looks good and you are available for promotion.  Hard targets are things like growth (I.e. your county/ province has to grow x% this year). Hard targets are preferential but as a cadre they don\'t matter as much and they don\'t make or break you like priority targets.  Soft targets are things that look good on paper and can help a cadre get promoted but they just aren\'t as important.\n\nWhy does this matter? Environmental targets are soft targets.  Although this is slowly changing, as it stands, growth and political targets get priority over environmental targets Every. Single. Time.\n\nFurthermore, the act of passing a law in China is an often multiple years long process.  Passing a law in China requires all the relevant ministries to put forward a CONCENSUS DRIVEN LAW. This means the growth and energy ministries must agree with the EPA to get a law passed.  The result?  The laws are often really vague and open to interpretation meaning different ministries can pick and which choose parts of the law to enforce.  This means that sometimes environmental ministries get to punish polluters (like the story in question) but most other times big polluters either bribe an official,are ignored by officials for advancement reasons, or get out of abiding by laws because of a loop hole.\n\nIn the end, law enforcement in China is often arbitrary and inconcistent and in NO WAY WHATSOEVER a model to look to.\n\n\nTL;DR Thank your lucky stars you were born in a developed country that gives at least a little bit of a shit about enforcing environmental protection laws.  Lord knows China is not one of them.'

aS"I'm not sure I'd agree the US is going in the wrong direction, I don't see much pullback of environmental regs (although I certainly am not in this day to day like you are!) - simply we allow more than other countries might for new tech like fracking.  This of course is open for serious debate as there are serious drawbacks, and very compelling reasons both for and against.  If you had the choice between engaging in wars in the middle east, or polluting locally which do you choose?\n\nThe US is in that weird in-between state in my opinion.  Where the regulations have become so much like the IRS tax code, where there are thousands of pointless trivial rules that regulators will come down on you like a ton of bricks for.   Minor shit like missing a barrel of used motor oil and not reporting that it spilled in the back storage lot, while ignoring huge loopholes like allowing fracking wastewater to be disposed of barely treated into local ecosystems.  This is why the EPA is a bad word in my redneck circle of friends - they work at small companies like machine shops, and see how onerous and stupid some of the regulations and fines are.  Then they watch other industries get away with comparative murder.  I'm not saying they are correct, but it's really easy to see why the perception is there.\n\nChina I agree will (hopefully) eventually catch up, but it's decades - at best - away at this point.  They have a whole lot more industrializing and pulling people out of abject poverty to do before environmental protection becomes any form of priority.  This is all my opinion of course :)\n\nThe kids comment was not directed to you, my mistake there.  Was directed to the morons trying to compare stuff like Deepwater Horizon to the everyday normal course of business currently in China.  They also forget China is simply where the US was 100 years ago in terms of this - at points in our history rivers would catch fire due to pollution.  We've come a long way, and I think it's hard for people to see that.  Mandatory world travel would be nice, if it were possible :)"

They'll dominate that region since those lanes are a cornerstone and lynch-pin to the economies in those areas, trade between East and middle Asia, Europe and Africa.\n\nWith control of those trading lanes, the Chinese will dominate that region by controlling these important trade routes and forcing the US/Anglo alliance to resort to more expensive means for power projection.\n\nThe doubt is the Chinese will be able to defend their claim to the territory if the US/Anglo alliances decide to contest again."

All the previous wars instigated by USA had little negative internal impact; war or even localized conflict with China will bring a lot of shit while American economy adapts. \n\nDo you think people will take kindly to a recession in America?

I agree that India is more likely to side with US than with China, but then there\'s Russia, which has been an Indian friend for the longest time, and Russia will undisputedly take Chinese side in that conflict if only to spite USA. At best India will remain neutral. Geopolitical affairs are much more intertwined that simply the current relations of two states, you must take your allies (even temporary ones) stance in consideration too.\n\nAnyway, this whole post is a simple American military dickwaving, which is so common it\'s not even funny. "What? Our most important trading partner that manufactures most of our goods is having some political ambition? We\'ll just ruin their economy with our mighty Navy, that\'s a good plan!" If anything, China is more important to USA than all its Asian allies combined, economically speaking - and Americans are the most economically-motivated people on Earth. While we can expect some diplomatic notes from USA and some economic pressure, raiding Chinese trade marine is a fantasy of military supremacists, it will not happen before USA becomes mostly independent from Chinese economy.

Mao's downfall was starting a cult of personality after himself (something Marx nor Lenin never advocated at all for Communism) which basically made his chain of command useless as they only cared whether he was happy or not. That lead to the failure of the Great Leap Forward.

India has 1.3 billion people (as of 2011, likely ahead of China now) while China has 1.399 billion out of a total of almost 4.5 billion people in asia. \n\nThe next six countries by population have another billion people and each with their own individual issues that contribute to the reasons behind child labor. \n\nhonestly you need to get your head out of your bum and learn about the world so you can get rid of pre conceived notions that are based on media reports from before you were born "

And we have much much more sophisticated supply routes and communication networks. \n\n\nTheir ability to fight is not in question, its more how the hell the economies would react. Maybe even so that fighting over key areas might not be resource based like Stalingrad but infrastructure based like Mariupol. \n\nI think it would be very different then previous wars. Honestly don\'t think we can comprehend what it would be like if great powers fought today. \n\nBut anything is possible. China is on the up and up and they have everything to loose.

The points I ignored regarding your post are all irrelevant excuses for the US\'s behaviour, as such not worth addressing. Let me summarize our exchange of words:\n\n1) The US is employing a containment policy. You disagree, and cite nothing but justifications for this US policy. I on the other hand provide plenty of articles talking about the existence of this policy, meaning many China analysts/officials believe this is an actual strategy at play.\n\n2) The "sovereignty" of disputed territories. You claim falsely that these disputed areas are already the sovereign territories of the ASEAN claimants, as as such under US protection as an "ally". This is completely and utterly incorrect.\n\n3) You claim that the trade directly affects American interests and as such requires them to put US warships there. Not only is this a blatant lie, the only reason they are of American interest is because China relies on this trade route for most of its energy supply, and China is the destination of the vast majority of these ships. And as for "it\'s impossible to blockade it", one notes that the USA is currently sanctioning Russia alongside Europe, has employed a decades-long embargo of Cuba, and has sanctioned China in the past. They are perfectly capable to doing so again, even if it hurts them.\n\n4) Now you are forced to admit that the other claimants all have their own installations for years, yet you try again to spin it as "but they\'re not constructing as fast as China". Well of course they aren\'t, they\'ve got their own installations set up for years. China doesn\'t have any installations, so they\'re building them quickly now. Is that seriously a surprise to you? Anyways, you haven\'t answered the question: why is it that any other claimant\'s military installations in the region not "tension-raising", yet China\'s building of artificial islands to do the same invites such a disproportionate US response?\n\nIf you can\'t sufficiently answer the above points, then we really don\'t have much else to say to each other. Good day to you.'

UNCLOS is irrelevant only from the perspective of the Chinese.\n\n&gt;  The Philippines has been able to challenge Chinas nine-dash line before an international audience; China has boycotted the proceedings and refused to acknowledge the tribunals legitimacy, yet submitted its own brief nonetheless; Vietnam refused to formally join the case but submitted its own statement unexpectedly to support its Philippine neighbors and advance its own claims; And despite its neutral position on sovereignty disputes and its non-ratification of UNCLOS, the United States has cast doubt on Chinas claims through its Limits in the Seas paper."

Second, U.S. forces have multiple options for actively and passively impeding the effectiveness of any attack, including targeting forces ashore.  Third, if a carrier actually were hit by anything less powerful than a nuclear weapon, it could absorb the damage and continue operating in some diminished capacity; it almost certainly would not be sunk.

To quote that Forbes article again. \n&gt;With regard to tracking and targeting a carrier, it is important to understand what a big place the Western Pacific is.  The hotly contested South China Sea measures over a million square miles, and it constitutes only a small portion of the waters adjacent to Chinese territory.  While it might be possible for Chinese satellites, aircraft, warships or land-based radars to detect a carrier there, it is quite another thing to continuously track and precisely target the constantly moving vessel.  Satellites close enough to distinguish the carrier will quickly disappear over the horizon, planes will run out of fuel or be scared off by the carriers fighters, and other approaches produce similarly spotty results.  China will need to invest billions of dollars over a period of many years before it has the assured capacity to find and track U.S. carriers.\n\nYou could bring up the Fiery Cross Island that they are building.

aS"/u/Yx1317 is correct. The reason that China is effectively uncontested (in the sense that they are significantly stronger) is because most of the competing countries also are essentially ignoring UNCLOS which gives them little legal basis to challenge China multilaterally in the UN. The whole region should probably be considered the high seas, but none of the countries involved are willing to settle to that so China has (rightfully) been able to dispute everyone's claims on a unilateral basis instead of a multilateral one (The region vs them). If the other countries involved were willing to abandon their claims (which are equally as ridiculous as the Chinese claim), they'd probably stand a chance battling it in the UN. "

Now what about the the PRC?  They aren't Taiwan, yet.\n\nBut let's assume that the PRC in facts owns all the EEZ rights of Taiwan.  Is this what you're arguing?  Then China has a 200 mile circle around Taiping, *and nothing else*.  All of the rest of the SCS belongs to surrounding countries, subject to their EEZs, correct?\n\nYet the 9-dash-line is much bigger than a 200 mile circle around Taiping.

p2246
aS"&gt; Then your point is moot because China isn't claiming an EEZ.\n\nSee https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42784.pdf\n\n&gt; In a document submitted to the United Nations on May 7, 2009, that included the map as an\nattachment, China stated: *China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the\nseabed and subsoil thereof (see attached map [of the nine-dash line]). The above position is\nconsistently held by the Chinese Government, and is widely known by the international\ncommunity.*\n\nChina actually goes beyond an EEZ, claiming control of all activity (navigation, not just economic exploitation) within a 200  mile zone.  This is what US naval activity is challenging, because it contravenes generally accepted international law.\n\nHowever, as the article points out, there is also a strategy of deliberate ambiguity and creeping annexation - they take islands an assert control without making a 100% clear (and legally challengeable) claim.\n\n&gt; China has maintained some ambiguity over whether it is using the map of the nine-dash line to\nclaim full sovereignty over the entire sea area enclosed by the nine-dash line, or something less\nthan that.37 Maintaining this ambiguity can be viewed as an approach that preserves flexibility for\nChina in pursuing its maritime claims in the SCS while making it more difficult for other parties\nto define specific objections or pursue legal challenges to those claims. It does appear clear,\nhowever, that China at a minimum claims sovereignty over the island groups inside the nine line\nsegmentsChinas domestic Law on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, enacted in 1992,\nspecifies that China claims sovereignty over all the island groups inside the nine line segments.38\nChinas implementation on January 1, 2014, of a series of fishing regulations covering much of\nthe SCS suggests that China claims at least some degree of administrative control over much of\nthe SCS. \n\n&gt; Observers frequently characterize Chinas approach for asserting and defending its territorial\nclaims in the ECS and SCS as a salami-slicing strategy that employs a series of incremental\nactions, none of which by itself is a casus belli, to gradually change the status quo in Chinas\nfavor.39 At least one Chinese official has used the term cabbage strategy to refer to a strategy of consolidating control over disputed islands by wrapping those islands, like the leaves of a\ncabbage, in successive layers of occupation and protection formed by fishing boats, Chinese\nCoast Guard ships, and then finally Chinese naval ships.40 Other observers have referred to\nChinas approach as a strategy of creeping annexation41 or creeping invasion,42 or as a talk and\ntake strategy, meaning a strategy in which China engages in (or draws out) negotiations while\ntaking actions to gain control of contested areas.43"

It is commonly accepted that rocks and artificial islands do not generate EEZ. China has expressed not a single attempt to contradict this, and them building artificial islands are not done for the purpose of EEZ, but for the purpose of building military facilities.\n\nThe basis of your argument is that you said the Philippines have claimed rocks don't generate EEZ, but my citation proves that is only half of the story. The Philippines are reiterating the UNCLOS point that rocks do not generate EEZ, *and claiming that the Spratly archipelago are only comprised of rocks*. As such, they can claim the islands as part of their EEZ projected from their mainland.\n\nThe only fact I have stated is that Taiping Island is the only habitable island in the region, and thus according to an acceptable interpretation of UNCLOS the only island that generates an EEZ. All your arguments based on EEZ are incorrect in light of this examination, unless you care to provide a counter-argument to disprove the interpretation I cited.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the nine-dash claim except for the fact that China/Taiwan's claim are strengthened by their control over Taiping."

aS'Well just to start, there\'s obviously the issue with Crimea. Russia is largely a landlocked country. The only traversable river in all of Russia is the Volga, and that\'s often frozen over. Their northern ocean ports are usually hampered by ice and weather, and their port at Sevastapol represents their sole access to the Black Sea and to the Mediterranean. Putin *needs* unfettered access to this port to have any real chance of asserting Russian will over the seas, and to keep goods flowing in out of Russia via water (much easier and cheaper than over land). It\'s such a critical geopolitical objective that he was willing to flat out invade Crimea immediately following the Kiev protests and the ousting of the pro-Russian Ukranian president, regardless of the consequences.\n\nSecondly, the big picture. The Eurasian Plain that makes up Russia\'s western border is almost entirely flat, easily traversable land. This is a problem because it is extremely easy to invade Russia along this route. It\'s is compounded by the fact that Moscow and virtually all of Russia\'s other industrial/population centers are only a short distance from the Western border (Hitler made it to the gates of Moscow in less than a month). Thus, even a *somewhat credible threat* of the invasion of Russia from the west represents an existential threat to them, and they have to spend inordinate amounts of resources on border defense. Think about how the borders of other countries are set up: China is essentially encircled by inhospitable deserts and the Himalayas. European nations are criss-crossed by rivers and mountain chains that have historically set up dozens of choke points for any potential invading force. The United States has had the grand gift of being separated from any competing powers by the two largest oceans on the planet (and now the most unequivocally dominant naval force the world has ever seen to boot). All of these are luxuries that the Russian nation does not have.\n\nSo, Russia has this problem regarding the defense of it\'s western border that has repeatedly whooped its ass since before the time of Peter the Great. How do you solve this problem? Strategic depth. By bringing as many Eastern European nations under the Russian fold as you can (as the with the USSR), or at the very least subjugating those nations to Russian influence (as with the Russian Empire and today), you build a buffer between yourself and the competing Western powers. Therefore, even if you do get "invaded" the enemy will still have a lot of ground to cover before they reach Russian territory, giving them time and space to set up an effective defense. For Putin, ideally this depth would stretch all the way to the Danube, though it\'s likely that he will have to settle for Eastern Ukraine.'

I am not actually trying to engage in conversation on this point though because I think OP's original point was really simple, but reddit is obsessed with atheism so there's an intense backlash.  The simple point is that from what everyone agrees is religion, the USSR and China did not have official state religions, and they persecuted people.  Immediately that caused philosophical word-twisting with trying to compare Stalin to some sort of religion, but why are we doing this? We know that the USSR was vehemently anti-religion.  This should be a very obvious point. "

At the time both Vietnam and Philippines were still technically colonies so they didn't get a say in deciding who should get the islands the Japanese occupied, while China was considered a major ally of US, and thus was given tacit approval.

Twice Vietnam made made it well into their country and could have attacked their capital but withdrew. In return the khmer rouge said if they could rally an army of 2 million and every soldier kills 20 Vietnamese there would be no more Vietnam problem. What were they to do but eliminate such racist genocidal maniacs? \n\n"Invade Thailand" is dishonest. Thailand was providing refuge to the khmer who were waging guerilla warfare against Vietnam and her ally, the current regime in power in Cambodia. The Vietnamese never launched a full incursion into Thailand they fought near the borders because Thailand involved itself in the war. China did invade Vietnam to back their psychopath allies though, and left a trail of destruction in their path. According to Beijing it was to teach Vietnam a lesson.. One that costs thousands of Vietnamese and Chinese lives.\n\n The khmer rouge repeatedly killed UN peacekeepers despite the UN recognizing their regime.

aS'&gt;*That doesn\'t make it any less ridiculous.*\n\nWhat\'s ridiculous about it? To me, what\'s ridiculous is Vietnam making the claim based on their former colonial rulers\' claims on the Spratys and Paracel islands (France contested control of the islands with China in the 19th Century). What\'s ridiculous is that the Philippines made the claim based on "terra nullius" which is literally contradicted by every other claim in the region (they made multiple attempts to acquire the island despite China\'s control over the archipelago even before their independence). What\'s ridiculous is that somehow when ROC first made the eleven-dash claim decades ago it wasn\'t an issue with the US (and in fact the US pointed out to the Philippines back then that the Spratlys are not theirs), but after all these years China building artificial islands now "causes tension".\n\nIf proximity was all there was to a territorial dispute, why is the Falklands part of the UK?\n\n&gt;*The worst part is that the PRC doesn\'t even seem to be trying to negotiate on reasonable terms.*\n\nWrong. The PRC\'s terms was that the negotiation be strictly between each country and China, instead of any united group designed to shut China out while they split the area amongst themselves. China\'s record of settling disputes is extremely generous, giving away more than 50% of their original claims in 17 of 23 disputes. China is also both the last party to build military facilities and airstrips in the region, and after Vietnam in building artificial islands on areas they control.\n\nThe Philippines and Vietnam are just using the US to back up their own claims in the region.

p2333
aS'&gt;*Now that we\'ve cleared that up, let me repeat my stance on this matter. Any construction undertaken in disputed land is per definition a hostile act to the other claimants, it\'s, from their perspectives, a foreign power exercising control over what they see to be their land.*\n\nFirst of all, if you open Pandora\'s box, don\'t expect it not to bite you in the ass. This is what happened with Vietnam building artificial islands on disputed lands, thus setting precedent for all other major claimants to do likewise. And China has vastly more financial resources to engage in such faster and bigger than everyone else, which is what is happening now.\n\nSecond of all, no Vietnam\'s land reclamation is not "reported for years". There are no 70+ articles on /r/worldnews about Vietnam\'s island building in 2014 when they started, despite the US clearly have the satellite data to prove this. The US is doing nothing but a selective interpretation of the facts, otherwise known as propaganda.\n\nThird of all, Chinese "domination" of the area is by no means a "threat" to the US or the West, except in terms of the US\'s ability to impose a blockade/embargo/sanctions on China via blocking the Malacca straits. As said elsewhere, ensuring "freedom of navigation" for the ships in this region is very much in China\'s interest as the vast majority of those ships are bound for China in the first place, and the only party that will ever threaten this in the region would be the strongest naval power in the world: the United States.\n\nFinally, China is not going to stop construction when they are the LAST of the four major claimants to build military facilities and airstrips in the region. To do so would be against their country\'s self-interest, and unlike Japan and Korea the US hold no sway over China to force this demand upon them.'

aS"Correct. But guess some SJWs just can't face it.\n\nOne of the more obvious red flags is that offices outside China like the ones in HK has been rendered almost completely irrelevant in global manufactring industry since the day China joined WTO and had the world's largest and busiest seaports. But for some people and SJWs who don't know what's going on in the region, they will fall for the same agenda led by the rich and the liberals in countries like US or UK. In fact, countries with population that actually know what's going on in the region like Korea and Japan are moving every factory they can from China to Vietnam or Bangladesh in the past few years. Just compare the assemble sites of Samsung and Apple you can already tell. Samsung have even more investment in Vietnam and Korea in the future. Apple, aka the middle class liberal's favorite brand, invest almost nothing in Southeast Asia and the US."

Without China doing this, more and more control will ultimately fall into the hands of the Americans. If anyone believes that's a better option than China, that person is entirely naive. At least necessitating amicable relations with China ensures peace within the region while having to suck up to the US, some warmongering nation on the other side of the planet, while ruining relations with your neighbour whom that warmongerer wants to destroy - inevitably ruining your own nation in the process.)"

China\'s basically "justifying" and expanding its claim the the sea by building these islands. Other countries, especially the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam (all of which have coastlines/ depend on the sea for access to maritime trade and access), the U.S. (trade), etc., who depend on/ have a lot of activity in the area, while certainly not exactly innocent parties themselves, rightfully have a lot to be angry about over China\'s actions. \n\nBasically, due to the way "Exclusive economic Zones" are decided, China is artificially expanding its claim over the sea by building artificial islands.

Both are history if you look at it that way and both events happened when the US and China were very different countries. Exactly how is China being aggressive right now? The US still hasn\'t ratified the UN law on maritime borders, so the US can not say that China is building in other countries waters, that is why all we hear is "China should stop creating tensions." \n\nI don\'t look at Chinese state controlled media, that is a waste of time and every thinking person knows that. Propaganda does not only have to be state sponsored media outlets. The US media always tries to paint these incidents as US good, China bad. Even though the US has no legitimate reason to be involved in the area, since it can\'t get itself to ratify or respect international laws. \n\nThe statement the article talks about is propaganda, since its only aim is to smear China and make the US look like it is trying to stand up for the little guys. None of those make any sense. \n\nThough i am curious if you would define propaganda differently. '

aS"Good. China has attempted to bully every single one of it's naval neighbors into a psychotically redrawn map that would give it control of an entire sea. This is nothing new for China, which has had no problem killing civilians and suppressing information to annex or control land, which can be seen in their actions taken to control Tibet and their regular support of the North Korean regime.   I know a lot of Redditors in this sub love to bash America, but the reality is that between Russia and China there are a lot worse in this world, and we should give them a good sharp kick in the nuts.

aS"I think we both agree that what China is doing in the SCS is bad right? The US wants to contain Chinese dominance in the region, i want that too. The way the US could do this is by ratifying international maritime laws and follow them, then without double standards, the US could slam China for not following said international standards, giving their argument legitimacy. Instead, the US does not want to follow international laws itself, because this may be against US interests in other areas. So the US tries to make up excuses to be relevant in the SCS conflict, but can't really come up with anything worthwhile. "

The US cannot echo this, because they do not actually ratify that treaty. \n\nThat is what i am talking about and why the US involvement in the region makes little sense. The US does not even recognize its allies claims in the region. All the US is doing is saying "China is creating tension, bad China" because that is literally the only argument they can bring to the table.

p2404
aS'Odds are though in a war between China and the US, the US destroys the Chinese navy and its artificial islands, and then proceeds to blockade China.\n\nAfter that everyone starts yelling at each other, neither side would want to escalate things further and risk a nuclear war. \n\nSo outside of initial naval battle, blockade, and the occasional airstrike, not much would actually happen in a war with China.  \n\nThe results would probably be China giving up its claims and not doing much for a decade, and then go right back to claiming the South China Sea.'

Meaning China wins.\n\nIf the US would make a real case out of this in the UN by ratifying the treaty, the US could make a huge deal out of this and maybe get China to back off. However the US wont out of self interest. \n\nMy opinion on this is that China is probably going to walk away with the whole SCS and the US will have no one but itself to blaim for its loss of control. And the whole west will probably suffer for it. \n\nI would love to be wrong about this, but it seems to me that this is going to be China's win unless the US changes attitude about upholding international standards.

aS"&gt;It doesn't matter if everyone is stupid. There is a sufficient amount of stupid people to generalize. \n\nIf the world keep generalizing us as a whole country, I don't understand we should try to become what the rest of the world is. If you, as in the world, don't give the population in this country a chance to prove themselves how is that right? I'm not saying that it's going to be easy, we've easily screwed up a lot of countries in this world and have done some of the worst things in history, but we aren't the only ones. Has East Germany been completely forgiven by everyone? No, but half of the population there opposed the Nazis and still they are ridiculed. I'm not trying to use other countries to justify our mistakes, as I don't believe they should.\n\n&gt;Stop with the relativistic argument. It's simply not valid. The US is the absolute worst when it comes to brainwashing and having insane people living in it. No other country is as horrendous. \n\nI agree, unfortunately. Just look at our military. Sure, it's one of the strongest among countries, but it's as corrupt as the religious wackos we have here. Our government lies to us, tells us that other world powers are trying to take over the world so we agree to blindly attack. Unfortunately with the rich in our society, throw a lump of cash in front of them and they'll wag their tails like the bitches they are. Our government is the worse and it's the elder people who vote them in. But you can't possibly group all the bad and good people together. That would be saying everyone is a murderer here; even the infants. Now I'm going to an extreme, but still this is what you imply.\n\n&gt;Yeah, but they are also not doing anything to change things and they are completely misinformed about the rest of the world and what's going on on this planet and their own country. Just talk to Americans on this site. They make excuses, they explain how what their country is doing is normal and acceptable, they go to great lengths to explain that their country is a good one. They are crazy. Americans are crazy. \n\nI refuse to vote in this country as a 23 year old. Maybe that's a bad thing, but my voice isn't enough. I'm a child in the eyes of the law still. Hell, I look like a child still. My one voice, or even the voices of my peers, will never get through to our government. I really don't think you understand how hard it is to be heard in this country. NO ONE CARES. And maybe that's the overall problem. We've let our government run us and decide what's best; I call it blissful ignorance-same with religion. Americans are crazy. You're right. But so is the rest of the world in their own way. Maybe we're crazier, or maybe you watch too much Larry King. Not everyone here is an ass or treats others with disrespect. And I would never try to defend this shit-hole the evils that come from it. We poison our communities with GMOs and without our knowledge. We are given decisions and then they decide for us anyway. How are we suppose to stop that when there are more idiocy than intelligence. I'm sorry you have a generalize view of us and I know it wont change. I don't care, personally. It's not my responsibility to go somewhere and convince them America's great, because I try not to lie to people. Believe me, if there was a way around ignorance, us intelligent people would've taken over a long time ago so we could let other countries go about their daily business.\n\n&gt;Just look at the downvotes I'm getting while the person I responded to got upvotes. \n\nSorry, just had to comment on this last thing. You shouldn't get downvotes because you are right. But maybe open up to the fact that the people who are upvoting me believe in the same as I. Our government is a corrupt piece of genetically modified cow shit and it would be amazing if people would open their mind for a minute to hear the things that need to be done. We all know you hate us, but our government has taught us - in schools mind you - that we are the ultimate superpower, China being behind us of course. This in itself is bullshit. I haven't been proud of this country since 9/11 and probably will remain that way until all the old shitty people die. All I can say is sorry; although a lot of ass-kissing would probably help as well. I suppose replying back is just a way to show you we aren't are all mentally challenged idiots. Here in the US, it's just easier to stay if your born here, doesn't mean that people wouldn't want to leave; our government just makes it damn near impossible. Like you said, though, everyone hates us. How are we to be accepted anywhere else, no matter what our views were?

They conclude that, in some highly regulated countries that do not have effective government institutions and governance systems, corruption can compensate for red tape and institutional weaknesses and grease the wheels of the economy.\n\nThis argument does not stand up to scrutiny when looking at the long-term corrosive impact of corruption on economic growth, equality and the quality of a countrys governance and institutional environment. Evidence indicates that corruption is likely to adversely affect long-term economic growth through its impact on investment, taxation, public expenditures and human development. Corruption is also likely to undermine the regulatory environment and the efficiency of state institutions as rent-seeking distorts incentives and decision-making processes.\n\nNot only does corruption affect economic development in terms of economic efficiency and growth, it also affects equitable distribution of resources across the population, increasing income inequalities, undermining the effectiveness of social welfare programmes and ultimately resulting in lower levels of human development. This, in turn, may undermine long-term sustainable development, economic growth and equality\n\nhttp://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/answer/the_impact_of_corruption_on_growth_and_inequality\n\nChina's growth has more to do with the exploitation of it's large population of unskilled workers and poor long term economic policies which China is reaping the benefits of now. \n\n\n"

The difference is that China is trying to infringe on default coastal EEZs, whereas the others are trying to grab open ocean, for the most part.\n\n&gt;  The Philippines could challenge China in the UN if it was purely over their EEZ under UNCLOS, but because they are claiming more than they are allowed (just like everyone else), they don't have a strong case.\n\nThe Philippines are mounting a legal case, arguing among other things that rocks and semi-submerged islands don't count toward an EEZ.\n\nhttp://www.lawfareblog.com/2015/01/unclos-on-trial-in-the-south-china-sea/\n\n&gt; [Jay Batongbacal leads off with Arbitration 101](http://amti.csis.org/arbitration-101-philippines-v-china/), a terrific primer on what has happened so far in the arbitration and what we might expect from the South China Sea case in the coming months. Batongbacal reviews the events that led the Philippines to initiate arbitration in 2013 and explores the legal basis within UNCLOS for it doing so. He explains how the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) has proceeded with the case despite Chinas refusal to participate and discusses the submissions that have taken place so far, including the Philippines Memorial submission in March 2014, and the relevant papers released by China, Vietnam, and the United States in December 2014.\n\n&gt; ... Batongbacal reviews the core of the Philippines argument in the case: Chinas nine-dash line claim is inconsistent with UNCLOS; China has illegally occupied or controlled eight features in the South China Sea and claims excessive maritime entitlements from them; China has unlawfully claimed or exploited resources within the Philippines EEZ and Continental Shelf. He also summarizes Chinas counter-arguments in its December 2014 position paper: The arbitration is a dispute over territorial sovereignty over features in the Spratly Islands and Scarborough Shoal, which UNCLOS does not address and the Tribunal cannot solve\n\n\nOne of the problems is that China is being ambiguous - they're claiming everything inside a nine-dash line, but declining to state the basis of the claim (presumably EEZ based on islands).

These items represent a "shared heritage" between a number of different cultures.

aS'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea\n\n&gt;*The nine-dotted line was originally an "eleven-dotted-line," first indicated by the then Kuomintang government of the Republic of China in 1947, for its claims to the South China Sea. After, the Communist Party of China took over mainland China and formed the People\'s Republic of China in 1949. The line was adopted and revised to nine as endorsed by Zhou Enlai.*\n\nIt is an official claim of Chinese control over the Paracels and Spratly islands, that can be traced back to 3rd century (Jin Dynasty), then Southern Dynasty, then Sui, then Tang, then Song, then Yuan and Ming etc via archaeological remains and ancient records.\n\nIn the 19th century, Qing China contested various Western powers over the ownership of the islands (being a sovereign state while Vietnam and the Philippines were colonized). China defended its ownership against the likes of Germany, Britain, France etc.\n\nWhen Qing collapsed and the Republic of China was formed, China focused on defending its claims on Paracels over that of Spratly. During WW2, Japan conquered those islands, and after its defeat the ROC were given control of the territories (Paracels and Spratly) Japan surrendered. The ROC also took effort to establish a base on Taiping Island, the largest island of the Spratly archipelago. In 1947, China officially declared its control via the eleven-dotted line (turned into the nine-dotted line when the CCP inherited the claim).\n\nThe Philippines and Vietnam seized the opportunity to take control of what they could in 1950s-70s when ROC lost the civil war and withdrew their ships, an act that was long planned for as they had their eyes on the waters for a long time.\n\nIn short, Chinese claim is strengthened by the fact that they are "most active claimant", most extensive historical records of ownership/control, "earliest effective occupant" from 1947-50 and 1956-now.  The Philippines and Vietnam on the other hand have none of these things, and rely on stealing territories that were formerly under Chinese control and then justifying their actions by portraying themselves as victims.\n\nConsidering the Chinese claim (before the 19th century) precedes the Philippines\' status as an independent country (1946 Treaty of Manila), is it really that much of a surprise that the Philippines\' EEZ (UNCLOS signed and ratified 1982-84) overlaps the Chinese claim?'

aS'That\'s quite the essay you just wrote.\n\nProblems with it.\n\n1. the 9 dotted line is much bigger than the Paracels and Spratlys.  It covers over 80% of the South China (West Philippine, or maybe East Vietnamese?) Sea.  Why not just claim the islands, and leave the sea alone, if China does not want to claim any EEZ?\n\n2.  Did China really historically control  *all* of the Spratlys and Paracels?   Or does it have a claim to just some of the islands?\n\n3. When you  refute any Chinese claim to an EEZ (ie, claiming that only Taiwanese controlled Taiping is entitled to an EEZ) , are you saying that China is abandoning all claims on oil and fishing inside other countries\' EEZs?  If so, why does the 9-dash-line extend into the EEZs?\n\n4. Are you thus saying that *if* a \'Chinese\' island lies inside another country\'s EEZ, China admits it has no right to fish in that region, except perhaps within the 12 mile territorial limit of that island?  (In fact, non-islands like the Spratlys don\'t even have a 12 mile limit by Article 60(8)) of the LOS Convention).\n\n\n5. What rules do you (and China) think apply when the 9-dotted-line overlaps an EEZ?\n\n6. Why does China [officially say](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234936.pdf) "China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent\nwaters, and enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed\nand subsoil thereof (see attached map [9-dash-line])."  I thought you just told me that there was no EEZ attached to the islands, but China is *saying* it claims all rights within the line.\n\n7.

Mr. anonymous-coward asked me to explain China\'s reasoning behind the nine-dash claim specifically, not an overview of all claimants\' reasoning.\n\nChina has repeatedly insist on bilateral negotiations, so no they are not going to take it to "international court" because that will set a precedent for the world (read: the US) to meddle in China\'s affairs. It has nothing to do with the "strength" of the claim.\n\nIf you want to challenge what I\'ve wrote, feel free to point out the areas you disagree. Otherwise, don\'t waste my time.'

aS"I agree With that logic no doubt. But China is a rising power. They will do everything that is necessary to keep us at bay. this whole island building is designed to give the chineese an extra 1,000 miles to defend their homeland and you can bet your bottom dollar they're going to put anti carrier missiles on those island and radars with the intent purpose of destroying our navy. That's just how it is. You better hope we can jam their sats and hack those missiles or our carriers could quite possibly be destroyed by cheap missiles.."
p2486
aS"China is thinking about countering our defenses while they build islands 1,000 miles from their coast. Probably with the intent of radar stations and missiles that can defelct lasers or electro magnetic resistant materials to make sure they don't get hacked. No doubt we can block their satelites but something tells me when they militarise those islands it's going to be dificil for us to counter"

Only the subjective opinions in the last paragraph are my own words.\n\n&gt;*the 9 dotted line is much bigger than the Paracels and Spratlys.*\n\nSo? The claim was made before UNCLOS. China on the ground has not acted to enforce their claim over the entire sea, as you should be well aware. As for your suggestion, that is what Taiwan is looking to shift their claim (currently identical to China\'s nine-dash claim) towards in an effort to "modernize" it.\n\n&gt;*Did China really historically control all of the Spratlys and Paracels?*\n\nAll of them. This is a problem?\n\n&gt;*are you saying that China is abandoning all claims on oil and fishing inside other countries\' EEZs?*\n\nNo, China has explicitly excluded the South China Sea from their ratification of UNCLOS, as such EEZ is irrelevant. One notes that the Philippines are also arguing that the Spraty islands (Taiping included) do not have any EEZ and they are claiming the islands based on the EEZ of their mainland, but they are incorrect as Taiping fits the definition of "habitable island" under UNCLOS. Also, one cannot claim territory based on EEZ. The ownership of Taiping is in reality just an extra point in China\'s favour in terms of their claim, and refers back to their historical ownership of the archipelago.\n\n&gt;*What rules do you (and China) think apply when the 9-dotted-line overlaps an EEZ?*\n\nThat is what will require bilateral negotiations.\n\n&gt;*Why does China officially say "China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters...*\n\nYes, China did say that. China is not going to openly bend until bilateral negotiations start, but until then China will not fully engage in resource extraction in the disputed waters as their official statement allows them. This is called a negotiation tactic. Taiwan has suggested a joint resource extraction scheme in highly contested areas, which may be a way out for the major claimants.'

aS'I\'ve a love-hate relation with Chinese ATM\'s. Mind you I\'ve little experience with American ATM\'s so maybe somethings are normally elsewhere. To begin China had little experience with card copiers so their machines are still poorly protected, I\'m just waiting for a gang to do something about this. Further more their layouts always seem to change, the numbers but also correct/enter/backspace. Then the menu some are in English, some not, some touch, some not, some have different items in the menu just for entertainment. You get then ATM\'s who refuse cards from certain banks (China has a fuckton of different banks) or limits what you can draw. ATM\'s hand out fake money (you read that right) I\'ve had already a few fake Mao\'s from Bank of China, walking in of course is a waste of time. Then ATM\'s also process cash, since payments are pretty rudimentary you often end up going to the bank of "destination" pick up physical cash and deposit, only to see the bills you just withdrawed to be refused for whatever reason. Cards get eaten for fun or your card is being held for 5 minutes to process and then to see them returned. Not to mention, if your card gets eaten a replacement isn\'t a replacement you get a whole new account and your old account gets transfered. There must be millions and millions of dead accounts out there.\n\nThe only neat thing is that they can recognize NFC chips and if you got a preferred card your life will be much easier. \n\nThat said I would rather see them work out a proper banking ATM before adding more futures which will throw you back.'

That's more than anyone lost in the Korean war where we were fighting over 1.7 million troops and China was involved.\n\nNot to mention NK is still using the same technology from this time period, maybe even worse now because it wasn't kept in shape.\n\nYeah they could use nukes, it's debatable they have real nukes capable of being deployed though.\n\nThe nukes they have would be VERY small."

aS'&gt; China on the ground has not acted to enforce their claim over the entire sea, as you should be well aware. \n\nThus they are NOT fishing in the EEZ of another country (barring interior lagoons of these \'islands\'), and they have no aims to extract gas or oil?    This is your claim?\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Did China really historically control all of the Spratlys and Paracels?\n\n&gt;All of them. This is a problem?\n\nPerhaps it is, unless China can show a historical, archaeological presence on each island, if this is basis of the claim.  I don\'t think anybody claim an area of ocean and say "whatever happens to be here, I own".  All that "Jin Dynasty" stuff applies to each tiny little rock.  Gotta find a coin or a fortune cookie on all of them.\n\n&gt;&gt; Why does China officially say "China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters...\n\n&gt;Yes, China did say that. China is not going to openly bend until bilateral negotiations start, but until then China will not fully engage in resource extraction in the disputed waters as their official statement allows them.\n\nSo you\'re now admitting that they claim more than would be permitted under an EEZ/territorial water scheme?\n\nIf in fact we accept your claim that only Taiwanese controlled Taiping is entitled to an EEZ, then NONE of the other islands even have a 12 mile zone, and there is no room for resource extraction other than within an interior lagoon (perhaps), or on the rock itself.   \n\n&gt; This is called a negotiation tactic. Taiwan has suggested a joint resource extraction scheme in highly contested areas,\n\nThere\'s nothing to negotiate!  China owns no territorial waters around the Spratlys, if your statement is right, besides Taiwan owning Hainan and a 200 mile zone around it.    If China seeks to extract resources or fish based its claims of these rocks, your belief that China concedes that only Hainan qualifies for an EEZ is wrong.  \n\nIn short, YOU may claim that only Hainan is entitled to territorial waters, but I don\'t see China agreeing with this, or giving up all that potential oil and gas and fish.\n\n'

aS'This is the LEGAL ivory industry that they are starting to phase out. Elephant poaching and ivory smuggling is already illegal. The legal industry refers to ivory from elephants that die from natural causes such as old age. Many asian nations have a strong history of ivory carving so China being one of them was reluctant to get rid of the legal industry. They wanted to preserve this cultural heritage. But the illegal poaching and smuggling had become such a big problem that they are now contemplating banning ivory across the board to make it harder for illegal ivory to masquerade as legal ivory.\n\nedit; this is indeed good news and probably game changing'
p2504
aS'So...the US is willing to be "bound" by the UNCLOS so long as it doesn\'t affect them?  This is the gist of a non-self executing treaty I believe, and the exact same position China has.  Interestingly, the Philippines makes this same claim, as its signing statement when it ratified the UNCLOS explicitly prohibited the terms of that treaty from affecting its sovereignty.  \n\nBuilding onto the islands to make the territory larger is permitted by the UNCLOS, although it is not a means of extending an EEZ.  That isn\'t a problem from the Chinese position because it claims the South China Sea as territorial waters, therefore the airstrip isn\'t the "legal basis" for its exploitation rights.'
p2505
aS'"In short, Chinese claim is strengthened by the fact that they are "most active claimant", most extensive historical records of ownership/control, "earliest effective occupant" from 1947-50 and 1956-now. **The Philippines and Vietnam on the other hand have none of these things,** and rely on stealing territories that were formerly under Chinese control and then justifying their actions by portraying themselves as victims."\n\n                 Insert       UGH            -\n\nThis is an accusation of the other claimants reasoning. That they have no proof and are justifying their actions by portraying themselves as victims. That\'s their reasoning. You said this.\n\nHere\'s Vietnam claims, which are as good as China\'s claims in trustworthiness. Which is why court of law is a better medium. \nhttp://southchinaseastudies.org/en/publications/vietnamese-publications/698-a-legal-analysis-in-support-of-viet-nams-position-regarding-the-paracel-a-spratly-islands\n\n\n\nNext, bilateral negotiations with a country much more powerful with more leverage (military power, economic power, sheer number of people power) is a mistake. Bilateral negotiations would give China an unfair advantage cause they simply have more leverage. It would also lend credence to China\'s bullshit nine dashed lines claim because they\'d first have  to acknowledge that china\'s claim has any grounding in international law in order to start negotiations on how to divide the sea.\nInternational court is better for all parties involved. No unfair leverage, only historical and effective occupation claims. According to you China would win easy cause other claimants claims are BS. And it is not \'China\'s affairs\' it is a global multilateral affair. Many countries depend on  SCS for transportation, food, resources.\n\nBilateral negotiations with China are a throwback to the tributary system:\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Chinese_tributary_system\n\nIn which China is the big boss in the area and all other kingdoms must adhere to its judgements. That may be why they want all other claimants to negotiate with them separately. China wants to be the big boss again, but other countries have moved onto the 21st century. You lend credence to this because you see international court as US interference, while other countries see it as the new global world we live in. One in which countries are equal in the court of law and MIGHT =//= RIGHT.\n\nWhatever though. You think China owns all the islands. I think that\'s complete shite. It\'s cool. At least you remained civilized - some of the other pro CPC posters made nasty remarks for no reason.\nDone here. Have a great life.\n\nOh PS: the distribution of the islands matter little at this point. Not worth human lives or a war. The right of other countries EEZ is more important.  And freedom of navigation.'
p2506
aS"This might be true in some of the war films, but their historical films often portray Chinese officials in a negative way, back when South Korea was a Chinese vassal state.  \n\nStill, the South Korean position with regards to China is probably tempered by practicality.  China virtually shares a border with South Korea.  While the US and Japanese fleet could likely defend Japan from Chinese aggression, that deterrence is much less significant on the Asian mainland.  Chinese cooperation will also be essential if SK ever intends to annex NK.  \n\nFurthermore, Korea has often benefited significantly from the China-Japan rivalry.  Korea's trade volume with China is larger than its trade with the US and Japan *combined* and exports reached new highs after the Senkaku-Diaoyutai debate flared up.  "

For example, Russia violated NATO air space with it's fighters several times, in threatening ways; yes, testing reactions was part of the point, but so was sending a message, especially as a response to the trade embargos.  Or, for another example, the US and China frequently do this over the South China Sea, both in a way that sends a message; China claims it as it's own territorial waters and says no one else has  a right to be there, but the US and other Asian nations in the area consider it to be international waters, so both sides make a diplomatic point by flying their planes there.  And so on.   "

p2511
aS'By repeating a lie often enough, it becomes truth in the eyes of the masses.\n\nFor instance, people here believe that China is unilaterally building islands. When that is proven wrong, they move to China bullying its neighbours. When it is shown they don\'t do much worse than what is done by other claimants, they move to how their claim is "ridiculous" and far from the Chinese mainland, which is funny considering the claim existed before some of the other claimants did as independent countries.\n\nAnd I\'m confident that everything refuted here will be repeated again as truth in the next thread, and the thread afterwards, and the one after that, probably by the same people who bullshit here.'
p2512
aS'No, Vietnam\'s claim is nowhere near as good as China\'s. Did you bother to read your own link? They claim historical continuation of ownership, which is already contradicted by Chinese ownership. They claim that colonial France "defended" their territory, which is again wrong because that\'s like HK claiming parts of the commonwealth, and Vietnam actually fought a war with France for independence, during which France did not control the disputed islands.\n\nThey are not "most active claimant", not "earliest effective occupant", or any other things. They started enforcing their claims only after China loses its grip on the islands due to civil war, and if their claim is "equally as strong as China\'s" they would\'ve been chosen to recieve Japan\'s surrender of the islands.\n\nHow is bilateral negotiations a mistake? China has been extremely generous with all of its bilateral negotiations thus far, and if you believe China bullied its way to get deals that gives away more than 50% of their claims, then is China really something to worry about?\n\nInternational "norms" are set by countries that did not include China: China has ratified some but for UNCLOS rejected the application to the disputed waters. Again, China is not going to set a precedent for multilateral negotiations, because obviously the US will try as hard as it could to meddle.\n\nFreedom of navigation is priority one of China. The maritime trade route is the source of China\'s critical oil imports. The ONLY country with the least stake in the region\'s "freedom of navigation" is the US, and they also have both the most powerful navy in the world and a history of enforcing sanctions/embargoes/blockades of their rivals.'

South Korean people's is increasingly viewing China more positively over the last few year."
p2514
aS"These islands are literally land. They also obviously belong to the Chinese. Thus they are no longer in international waters. The islands come with a new Chinese economic exclusion zone that pushes back the zone of international waters.\n\nI think china just found a clever way around the rules the USA unilaterally enforced on the world for the last hundred years. Nothing they are doing is illegal under international law. The USA created laws designed to benefit themselves and handicap rivals. Now China has become powerful enough to literally create new lands in the middle of the ocean and it's too late for the USA to change the rules again.\n\nI bet those islands will serve to push back American carriers from the Chinese mainland as the Chinese will stock them with carrier killing missiles so they can reach out and touch American naval groups even further now. I bet they'll also put Russian anti air tech on them maybe a few dozen ICBMs on each one radar and early warning and surround them with Chinese naval groups and submarines. \n\nThis is the end of American naval dominance in Asia."
p2515
aS'&gt; Nothing they are doing is illegal under international law.\n\nWell, there is such a thing as the World Court to decide these types of things. Of course, the US refuses to abide by the World Court since they ruled in Nicaragua\'s favor in our 1980s war on the democratic government of Nicaragua.\n\nEither way, the way to solve this issue is by sitting around a table and having diplomats argue while they order expensive lunches. Sending in the US Navy to harass China is military madness, but it does fit in with the mindset behind the US\' "Asian Pivot."\n\n&gt; "There has never been, nor ever will be, any such thing as a good war, or a bad peace." -- Benjamin Franklin.'
