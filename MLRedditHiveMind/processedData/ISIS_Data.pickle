In Saudi public schools the kids are taught that Shias/Chritians/Alawites are Infidels. Nothing's changed and it won't. ISIS is not a direct threat to the kingdom, in fact they share the same religious ideology and only differ on who should be king."

aS'I did say they are a lot \n\n&gt;are taught that Shias/Chritians/Alawites are Infidels.\n\nThat\'s because they are in Islam, they are all arguably Infidels in the eyes of each others. they have to implement religion into the curriculum and that\'s what their religion says. And you can\'t just remove religious studies from schools, they are so indoctrinated it will just feed into their "evil westernization" narrative and piss them off.\n\n&gt;ISIS is not a direct threat to the kingdom, in fact they share the same religious ideology and only differ on who should be king.\n\nboth are following *what i can argue* is -for the most part- the true version of islam. however, the religious indoctrination in SA has more emphasis on obeying the nation\'s ruler. in short: the religious nuts of SA -unlike isis\'- are controllable.\n\nEdit: arguably '

aS"Israel has 400 people/km^2. Kuwait has 200/km^2, Lebanon has 500/km^2 ...the Gaza strip has 5000 people/km^2. \n\nI am always so fascinated with Israel's pompous attitude on the matter. Its as if you think we don't understand that the UN and America gave you everything you needed to invade what is now your country, and then have the audacity to act as if it was smoke and mirrors and Gaza just simply came from nothing. I agree with the nation of Israel as an idea, whole heartedly would like to see it prosper, but actions do speak louder than words or ideas. \n\nWhat happens if someone is drunk in one of those buildings and asleep? What if someone is sick? Regardless, this is much more than bombings. Gaza is a wasteland, with poor sewage, little infrastructure, and a blockade blocking any supplies to rebuild at pace needed. They are forced to travel into Israel nonetheless (if they can) and are accosted by dozens of restrictive checkpoints to check their identity etc which can make going out and buying something a day's errand. I think the average Israeli poorly understands what the situation in Gaza is like, similar to how many Americans have no idea what Tijuana and South America is really like. They have never seen true poverty. Perhaps from so much experience roaming Gaza, the military does understand the situation in Gaza.\n\nAnd you're right. Sadly Gaza will be a pivotal fuel in causing both Israel and the West to fight this nonsense ISIS in Iraq and Syria for at least the next 20 years, radical Jihad as a whole probably the lions share of this century. \n\n \n\n\n"

Can you jew haters just for once admit that jews are a shining light to other nations. what other country as small as Israel devotes resources to rebuild an entire village? \n\nFor your 'rebuild' gaza bull... shove it right back up where it came from. Hamas, and let me go out on a limb and say the PA, don't want peace with Israel. THEY WILL BE IRRELEVANT WITH PEACE. Kinda like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton in the US with blacks and being equal.\n\nSo lets stop pretending that Hamas, the PA, and Hezbollah are some humanitarian angels.

But maybe that's intended and useful for keeping a high defense budget and keeping America as a superpower.\n\n If you can't give people a compelling reason to fight  (ie  ISIS)  they wont want to go back, they won't want to fund high tech military projects, etc, etc. Which the hippy inside us all may be happy about but, in the long term we dont consider how much it would suck if 'we' weren't the people with the biggest stick."

aS'&gt;Just like the Sunnis were purged from Iraq, right?\n\nYes, actually, a lot like that.  Our disastrous toppling of the Iraqi government led directly to the creation of ISIS.  Our installation of the Shiite dictator Maliki left many Sunni\'s with no choice but to support ISIS because they were the only ones willing to resist the Shiite government in Baghdad.  We then moved on to destroy Libya, which turned Libya from the most educated Country in Africa into another Somalia.  It flooded the Middle-East with heavy weapons and trained fighters from the heavily armed but now disbanded Libyan army.  Now we are trying to do the same in Syria.  We are helping Al-Qaeda and ISIS (who we are supposedly at war with) while out "allies" Turkey, Qatar, and the Saudis shower ISIS with funding.  \n\nWhat do you think is going to happen in Syria when Assad is toppled and ISIS takes over?  What is the scenario that you imagine?  We have turned Syria into a breeding ground for terrorists, and once Assad is finally toppled it will become a completely failed state like Libya.  '

There is nothing about Buddha and Buddhist ideology that says you can or should enslave, torture or kill. There is a lot about Christianity and Islam that says you can or should do it. That's why ISIS represents a plausible interpretation of the religion; but not the Muslim people themselves as they exist now, of course.

In the description:\n\n&gt;Unless the US Troop withdrawal date is extended past the end of 2011 the Yezidis could face full scale genocide at the hands of Moslem terrorists.\n"
p133
aS"Pretty sure it was ISIS that chose to start a genocide. Yes US actions from the 2003 war destabilized the region. But at the end of the day ISIS is solely responsible for their own actions. We don't blame France and UK for Hitler's genocide either despite their roles for weakening Germany after WWI. "

aS"If countries recognize it as a genocide then they have to act on it... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4KaIoqMC08\n\nSure the Americans are bombing some places where ISIS is located, but as soon as they have more troops on the ground then the rest of the world goes 'Team America at it again!Le freedom!'"
p136
aS'the world can\'t even surround ISIS let alone fucking China. the chinese understand its not a weaponry race the US will always be in lead. so they play the game of rough talks and table talks while banking and booming at the same time. after all, they won\'t be losing anything and the rest of the world would lose "everything".. there is no country on earth that doesn\'t owe china some money :)  this russia coalition thing is like tickling and cuddling to china.

aS"Really? You don't think what ISIS was doing to the Assyrians counted as a near genocide event? They slaughtered thousands and chased them up a fucking mountain so that they would starve to death. Without intervention from the West they would have probably died. Also yes Assad is a monster too, especially for using chemical weapons against his own people. In a war between ISIS vs Assad I hope they both lose. I just wish the FSA still had a chance. "
p140
aS'You just proved his point. The nazis were ruthless even without a religious agenda. There are plenty of peaceful Muslims in the world, ISIS is just another shitty group. Islam is just their excuse. '

p142
aS"Well, okay yea. I can't disagree with that. Still hindsight is 20/20. Sadly timetravel doesn't exist so we can't fix the mistakes of the past. What do you think we should do moving forward now? We can't just let ISIS do its own thing."
p143
aS"&gt;but the first country would have used child soldiers if they needed to\n\nthere's the rub, you can never know that for sure.  Now i just did a bunch of reading on youths in war through history, and while many armies have used boys from the ancient Greeks to the US in WW2, at least they knew it was wrong, that it was immoral.  They did it to their shame.\n\nThings like the LRA in Sudan were just abominations.  Boko Haram and ISIS are also that way, just put a gun in their hands, and if they survive its God's will.  That is a fucked way of looking at humans.\n\nFurthermore, i am in the camp in which no military conflict can ever be moral.  While you can have 'right' on your side, or think you do, one can never truly justify war through morality, other ways perhaps, but not through morality, not for me.\n\nbut yes, to the broader point, politicians claim whatever morals their base will follow, and that is likely to be the tie that binds all nations ever in history that had elected officials."
p144
aS"It's probably best not to make this the headline news, as fucked up as that is. The news media has a lot of discretion on what leads. While it's important to report, the more swollen ISIS' ego gets, the more they'll be able to recruit, propagandize, and intimidate.\n\nThe people who really need ISIS updates are sitting in Ramstein AFB right now."
p145
aS'And sometimes we bomb our own guys. Accidents happen. It doesn\'t mean that the "big bad evil US empire" sent planes to specifically kill civilians. \n\nBut hey, let\'s just ignore all the actual ISIS soldiers killed by US airstrikes, and just pretend the US hasn\'t saved thousands of civilians from ISIS, because vilifying a nation is a better story. '
p146
aS'These are still isolated incidents. Much more of the fighting against ISIS happens in more open areas that are less densely populated, and many less strikes happen in very close proximity to civilians.\n\nSimply because ISIS uses the human shield tactic does not mean that this is their main strategy against enemy strikes. Hamas builds around this strategy, they plan everything around it. If the IDF doesn\'t strike the target because there are civilians nearby, Hamas wins. If the IDF does strike the target and civilians nearby get hurt, Hamas wins ("look, evil Zionists!"). ISIS ceases the opportunity to take advantage of their environment. Hamas *creates* this environment so that it may use this tactic in the future.'
p147
aS'Oh god. Here we go. Genocide in Palestine my ass. If there is genocide in Palestine than the Israelis really fucking suck at it!! Seriously they provide Palestine with water, medical care, electricity, and even internet. That seems counter productive if genocide was the goal. \n\nIf Israel is committing genocide, is Assad committing mega genocide? He killed more Palestinians in a year than Israel in its whole existence. Is ISIS committing super-mega genocide? Did Hitler commit super ultra mega genocide then?  \n\nBut yea lets change the subject to Israel. That usually works for the Arab states in the UN. '

And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.  \n  \n* Quran 29:46: And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."\n  \n* Quran 22:40-42: **Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory.**\n [They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, "Our Lord is Allah ." And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.\n[And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to Allah belongs the outcome of [all] matters.  \n  \n* Quran 8:37-41: Say to the Unbelievers, if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), **their past would be forgiven them**; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and **there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere**; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do. If theyrefuse, be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help. And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to Allah,- and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing,- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.    \n  \n* Quran 2:190: **Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.**  \n  \n* From the Prophet\'s life: After conquering Makkah from the tribe that killed his family and friends, and opressed him for years, the Prophet simply said "You are free"  \n  \n* Or the fact that Muslims are prohibited from killing prisoners of war until they are tried in court. They were traditionally either let free or ransomed for money or education for the uneducated. What is ISIS doing?  \n  \n* Here\'s a great quote by Crusader Oliverus Scholasticus after losing a war to the Muslims and becoming a POW: Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God[i.e. Muslims]? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.\n   \n[BTW, you should check this out before spilling out ignorance](http://www.academia.edu/621299/Jihad_and_the_Quran_The_Case_for_a_Non-Violent_Interpretation_of_the_Quran)'

They self-identify as one, just like Egyptians self-identify as Egyptians.  That\'s the weird thing about the Right of Self-Determination, they get to decide for themselves whether or not they are a nation, and they have chosen to be one.\n\nPalestinian national identity began in the mid-1800s, decades before modern Zionism.

It may seem like a well defined term but in reality, those who call themselves "anonymous" might have any number of goals in mind from nefarious to altruistic, or for self gain or for justice for someone else. It\'s a completely ambiguous and amorphous term for people who use methods with computers to suit their end.\n\nTherefor, to group ISIS as a similar designation as Anonymous would be a misunderstanding in my opinion, especially since anonymous can\'t and doesn\'t actually claim any acts of any sort. People just usually use the term anonymous to describe themselves as above after they\'ve done something.'

aS"Hamas, Al Qaeda and ISIS have completely different ideologies, operational methods, goals. They are not simply different names for the same ideas, but radically different ideologies.\n\nAl Qaeda is a protest movement that is fighting against what it perceives as a spiritual sickness called 'Jahalia' spreading from the West. Jahalia is characterized by radical individualism, greed, consumerism, deviant sexual practices, and the use of torture. They began as a social conservative movement and radicalized as a result of torture.\n\nHamas is an anti-colonial nationalist movement who's goal has nothing to do with religion - they want to annihilate the state of Israel, which they perceive as an invading force. They are more than willing to embrace Western ideas to do so and are nationalists, not Islamists.\n\nISIS is also a nationalist movement, but they are an Islamic Nationalist movement - their goal is to politically unify Islam through conquest. They have embraced everything that Al Qaeda calls Jahalia though, promising wealth and slaves to their fighters. Their goal is to continue to conquer and expand.\n\nIt is a radical oversimplification of the world to imagine that every group of dissidents has the same goal."

Not as much as we'd LIKE, but it happens too.\n\nErdogan is an islamist, but just because he didn't send troops to fight ISIS, does not mean he supports them. He simply doesn't want to do Assad's and Iran's job for them (which would strengthen his rivals; including the PKK terrorists). He doesn't want to lose a lot of troops and then have some difficulties during elections or protests against a war etc.\n\nLook, everyone hates Erdogan.

aS'The response to the points you raise is very complicated. First of all, I cant speak for anybody but myself. And I would like to point out that due to the way a number of factors have arranged themselves, it is almost impossible to portray an idea and have it escape being painted by the same brush, painting the entire middle east the same color -much like the Red Scare.\n\nTo understand the silence, you must look at recent history. For the longest time, the middle east has been getting the short end of the stick. The US\'s failed endeavor in Iraq is exactly what created ISIL; many people forget that. Some even speculate that ISIL was founded by foreign intelligences, and unexpectedly grew to what it is today. For too many years, you had the brutal dictators suppressing protest indiscriminately in their countries, and the populations were hopeful that the knight in shining armor, protector of the free world, America the Great, would come and save them from their misery. When no help came, they eventually reached a state of learned helplessness. When the warlords and rebel leaders fell under the influence of ISIS, only because of ISIS\'s battlefield advances, they brought with them order. However shitty of an order it is, it is better than free-for-all chaos -not knowing if you will survive the next hour. The people who remained have been branded as "ISIS controlled territory", but these people are just trying to live and feed their families. These civilians could no longer give two shits about whether Bashar is removed or not. Because the world turned its back on them, they no longer care, not about themselves, not about geopolitics. \n\nWhat does this have to do with what happened in Texas you ask? Well, due to the way the media has been portraying Islam, and due to a number of events caused by fanatic madmen, there is a very negative perception of Islam in the West. As ISIS gains territory and influence, and its propaganda spreads far and wide, its recruitment numbers goes up. They love this. Of course this has nothing to do with "Islamic State" and everything to do with power and money. You hear about ISIS doing really shitty things, things that somebody who feared God would never think of doing. Why? Because there is no God in the equation, and this has nothing to do with Islam. It has to do with money and power. \n\nNow comes along Bubba #1 and Bubba #2. I dont know about Bubba #2, but Bubba #1 is a convert to islam. Perhaps he isnt happy with his current life in Arizona. Perhaps he suffers from psychiatric problems. Who knows. He has problems. He hears about this "Draw Muhammed" event in TX and thinks to himself, "shit, they cant do that to MY prophet! Im going to shoot them" He posts on his Twitter that he is doing to do "Jihad" (which means struggle. You can do jihad on your toilet.. its not only violence, but thats another topic) and applies some bullshit hashtag announcing to the world his intentions. He goes to TX, shows up with Bubba #2, gets shot and dies. \n\nISIS propagandists pick up his tweet and think its great, and in the interest of furthering their propaganda, they claim responsibility for this idiot\'s actions, and BAM all of a sudden, this random Bubba from Arizona is no longer relevant, and they just hijacked the media headlines all over the world. \n\nNow let me back up. Why the silence. Do you understand how the above game is unfolding? Its much bigger than me, and you, and Fred, and Bubba. Most of the Muslims living in western countries have come to realize this, due to paying attention to the recent history, and the political events that have happened in the last few years. I dont have statistics for you to satisfy the one guy whos going to comment "post source" but I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that the average Muslim household in America/Europe/Canada/Etc is more "up to date" on "current events" than the next guy. Shit some people on the street in America dont know who the current President is. Of those that do, few can count back 10 Presidents ago. \n\nThere is silence because we all know, this is bullshit and there is little we can do to stop it. The more ISIS gets airtime on the media, the most this bullshit is going to happen. We can "outcry" all we want (and we do, you just dont see it on the news as much, because it isnt as juicy of a story) but little will change. ISIS is the new Communist. The Military Industrial Complex needed another boogeyman to perpetuate its self, and now, it is Islam. Shame really.\n\nAlso you say "two muslims tried to cause a mass shooting"... I dunno if I agree with you there. Like I said, Bubba #1 is a convert, and God only know what kind of deranged shit has been fed to him by God knows who. \n\nSo there. Hows that for silence? \n\nI do appreciate your post though. \n\nEdit- forgot a few words'

The Syrian side has been controlled by ISIS for over a year.  The border which is open only for Syrians to cross is only guarded by a few border guards that are often seen wondering about.  Theres a shisha cafe on the turkish side that claimed it had regular ISIS fighters as patrons, being that smoking is haram on ISIS towns.  I've also read about a guy that had a different wife on each side of town and crossed the border everyday (probably not true but illustrates peoples perception of how penetrable the border is here)\n\nSince middle of last year, the town has been the main point of entry for foreign ISIS members to enter Syria.. and also has a deep history as a smuggling route into Syria.  Theyve been smuggling cigarettes through here for decades. \n\n\nI'm gonna assume your'e american since you are up at this time.. so basically its like sending bullet proof vests *illegally* into Ciudad Juarez (deadliest border town in Mexico/US).

ISIS could never reach a point of making a country or state for more then a few months, it would be squashed in a few months. they dont even have clear leader, strong infighting, no real objective thats shared. the problem is that the other countries in the middle east are fking stupid, weak and corrupt.

aS'The issue here is fundamentalism. To deconstruct fundamentalism a little more, fundamentalisms are movements which coalesce around the idea that a specific orientation to a religion, is the only correct one, thus casting only the believers in a righteous light and excluding non-believers (moderate Muslims in this case) as sub-human enemies bound for Hell. Although it might be tempting to imagine that ISIS as a fundamentalist movement is oriented primarily against the West, its not. ISIS and its fellow travelers within fundamentalist Islam derive their identities more from being holier-than-thou in relation to other Muslims than to the West.  The West, is just a prop, a windmill to be charged as a display of piety. \n\nThe bulk of "Moderate Muslims" as you term them, do not understand this. They merely see themselves as crappy Muslims, which, by the standards of fundamentalists, they are. The exception here is ethnically Muslim Westerners living in the West, who, to varying degrees, actually have Western values, but seek to accommodate their own ethnic and religious heritage and family obligations as we all do. These seem to be the people you are talking about. They are relatively few. It actually would be silly to "hate" these people. They are confused and desperately trying to accommodate fundamentally incompatible worldviews. \n\nISIS is not "trying to wedge" anything. They are just fundamentalists, doing what fundamentalists do: casting themselves as God\'s favorites and condemning anyone who does not toe their line to Hell. That is it. Period. \n\nYour imaginary journey into the motives of ISIS is an unfortunate distraction however, when we need to be thinking about how pernicious fundamentalism in general is to human society, and how Islamic fundamentalism is *particularly* harmful, here in the West and everywhere else in the world.

Break their will and win so completely they will never again try such an act.  Are we ready to drop nuclear bombs on the Saudi regime (follow the money and the roots of activist / radical Islam)?

aS"&gt;The groups have to be eradicated or made to loose support from the bottom up.\n\nNot even remotely true, you are perpetuating an untruth and a terrible strategy. Terrorist organizations tend to be full of division and bad actors. They are often held together by strong, educated, well financed leaders. If you rapidly take out enough of their top leadership, you end up splintering and fracturing the organizations as internal divisions take hold and grow. These are not the most disciplined characters in the world. \n\nThe US decimated 'Core Al-Qaeda' by taking out it's top leaders one by one. Al-Qaeda ended up in a substantially weaker state and it splintered into sub groups without central leadership. It's ability to launch high value attacks has been severely limited. \n\nISIS is even worse. Their ranks are full of criminals who lack discipline and direction without the leadership of key ruthless individuals. Taking out ISIS leadership is EXACTLY what needs to be done. You of course won't get rid of Jihadi's but you will be able to collapse the organization into something that is far more impotent and unable to easily hold territory.\n\nYou will never eradicate Jihadi's by force. You just have to keep them weak and divided. The only thing that will destroy these movements is time. Education, urbanization, social and cultural change. The Middle East is changing fast. The hottest chemical reactions always burn out the quickest. It may take a century but all we have to do is outlast them, help our allies in the region, keep ourselves safe, until time and change renders them irrelevant and obsolete. "

Where was the FBI then? Somebody on their radar just magically traveled hundreds of miles if not more, and not once appeared on the system as a red flag? Is the spying just on the everyday civilians or what..\n\nOr maybe they just let this happen, because you know.. false flag operations are good for the military/cybersec industrial complex'
p314
aS"Nor did I expect people display such a narrow minded attitude towards freedom of speech. Putting people who exercise free speech on the same platform as the rapists, murders and religious zealots who comprise ISIS seems a bit silly.\n\nThe current iteration of Islam leaves much to be desired in the realms of gay rights, women's rights, freedom of speech and sexuality. ISIS doesn't represent all of Islam but it does take it's legitimacy from the same books and the same prophet using direct quotes. There are Islamic scholars that I like (such as Dhiyaa Al-Musawi), and I hope they gain traction to modernize the religion. In the meantime, any religion who demands that their feelings are more important than the freedom to criticize needs to be criticized for that very reason."

aS"I admire your patriotism, but ISIS isn't looking to go on a full-scale war with the USA.\n\nI have a feeling if this was pre 9/11 and Al-Qaeda boasted about having 19 soldiers in the USA, we would see similar comments like yours. In fact I think that's why Al-Qaeda succeeded on 9/11 because no one took them seriously.\n\n71 terrorists can do a lot of damage, Al-Qaeda proved that with less than a 1/3 of the claimed ISIS members in the USA. \n\nISIS knows they are outnumbered, so they will try to kill as many people as possible. How do you do that? Not by doing what the idiots in Texas did, but traditional terrorist tactics. Suicide bombings, selecting vulnerable easy targets, etc. "

aS'From the government study:\n\n"A fundamental orientation denotes a strongly pronounced return to "true" teachings in their historically primal form".\n\nMuhammad was a brutal warlord who abused religion to make people die for him, bring him 20% of the war booty (Quran 8:41), and let him gain control over the cash cow (Kaaba) in Mecca. He made it allowed by Allah to take prisoners of war (Ma malakat aymanukum) as sex slaves (Quran 4:24). ISIS is doing the same today, so it\'s basically fundamentalism on jihad. Most fundamentalists aren\'t on jihad however.\n\nAnyway, it seems clear that ISIS is not a misinterpretation of Quran/Hadith, but simply a fundamentalist, more original interpretation.\n\n"I\'ve been made victorious with terror" (Muhammad)\n\nhttp://www.quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/004.052.220.html'

They'd rather see all muslims who aren't following Wahhabism have a bullet in their head than anything else before. Oh they hate everyone else just they see taking care of who they see as heretics within the muslim world as the first order of business. \n\nAs to be being slightly disorganised?

aS"I don't understand your response, aren't you agreeing with me?\n\nMuslims enslaved just as many as the Western colonialists. They did it for the slave's own good as well, and because the Quran and Hadith, the divine texts, said so. So, you do believe that ideology does influence behaviour. What, other than ideology, would make a sect reinstitute slavery like this? You don't see any other group praising this practice, in the FSA groups for example, because they know how immoral it is or at least seems to be. ISIS praises it because Mohammad condoned and commanded it, so ISIS does it. This is ideological."

aS'ISIS destroys replicas because they are "worthless" in the black-market, and they destroy monumental works that are either easily recognizable (and thus won\'t sell on the black market), or impossible to move. \n\nMeanwhile, they loot and sell "minor" artifacts that lack provenance.

Step 6 They launch multiple terrorist attacks at the US. I am a pacifist by nature, but I am also a thinking person, and I can recognize that pacifism only goes so far. Your "solution" literally solves no problem, and obviously leads to even bigger problems down the line. Congratulations you blew up. '

aS'&gt;While obviously civil war, Isis and terrorism are bad, and having a civil war end is both the morally and ethically right thing to do, from an international relations standpoint, prolonging the war in Syria for as long as possible is in the best interests of the west. The longer the war goes on, the more of our "enemies" (Assad, Isis, Iran, Hezbola) die. \n\nIts not in the interests of the general population of the West. Not even a little bit. Assad was not our enemy. He was at no time going to attack America. He did not support terrorism, at least to ISIS level degrees. If you think a stable democracy is coming out you\'re out of touch with reality. All this breeds is more hate, more enemies, and more death. Much of which will come home to the West. Not to mention that destroying economies that could sell or buy stuff never helps. I mean fuck, ISIS wasn\'t even an enemy until this mess in Syria. "Iran" isn\'t or enemy. The hardliners in Iran our the enemy and they get strengthened by stuff like this. \n\nThe only ones that benefit are those who using this to secure there power. Iran hardliners. ISIS. Neocons. And so forth.  All the civilians just get screwed. \n\n&gt;We all rail against the injustices of the world, expressing our outrage at the atrocities that take place on humans, just like us an ocean away, but when it comes right down to it, if most people were to be asked if they were willing to pay for the righting of these wrongs with our own money, our own blood... how many do you think would actually do it? Nations are the same way. The only way to change this is to change the world.\n\nWe can\'t fix this with blood and money. We tried that remember? There was this huge invasion into Iraq. In large part it created the vacuum for ISIS to form. Our misguided efforts to arm and train rebels. The drones that create so much anti-American hatred. All the weapons and support we send to Saudi Arabia. The coup we started in Iran that led to the current government. The support we gave to the nice rebels fighting The Soviets. \n\nJust walk away. Stop breaking stuff. Stop making it worse. We\'ve stirred it up with misguided attempts to fix problems again and again. It costs nothing to just stop. '
p388
aS'As for the enemies thing, that\'s why I put it in quotes. There is no danger that they are going to attack us, they are just opposed to the west diplomatically and alignment wise. Also, did it ever occur to you that we are not trying to fix things through the wars and money we pump in? Yes, doing this does stir up a ton of violence and bloodshed and is bad for the region... but that doesn\'t mean it\'s not beneficial to us. I\'m not saying it\'s a good thing, it\'s just that an unstable environment allows other nations exert their influence on areas to an extent they would never be allowed to get away with in peacetime. A free and democratic Syria is a pipe dream, I believe I already said that in the main post, but it makes one hell of a slogan for selling an intervention doesn\'t it? Think about it, every time we\'ve threatened to intervene, it has been when one side is becoming too powerful. First Assad with chemical weapons, then weapons to "moderate rebels" when that didn\'t work, then when ISIS appeared suddenly everyone was concerned about weapons getting into the right hands, so the shipments stopped for a while, then an aerial campaign when Isis got too powerful.\n\nThe thing you don\'t understand is the fact that while you believe that the resentment that our meddling brings about will come home at some point (rightfully or not I don\'t know), those in power in our governments do not. They believe that the risk of retaliatory attack against us is remote and is worth the bases, influence and weakening our (again in quotes) "foes". \n\nYes civilians die and will continue to die, but from a nations perspective, as long as they are not ours or an allies... no one cares unless they an use saving them as a justification or pr. '
p389
aS"&gt; there's been no evidence of chemical weapons used by rebels.\n\nThere's been no evidence of certain chemical weapons, like sarin. But ISIS has been known to weaponize chlorine, etc. I'm not sure if you would exactly call them 'rebels' though."
p390
aS'You do realize you are calling for the wholesale destruction of the vast majority of the world\'s population based on their beliefs that may or may not be due to the culture they were born into, right? Not sure how "great" of an idea that is.\n\nMaybe a rephrase? "Wouldn\'t the planet be fantastic if we got rid of every religion?" I still wouldn\'t agree with you, but at least it is less "atheist ISIS" sounding.'
p391
aS'Kurds and Baathists are both Muslim groups. You sound like you are saying it\'s racial and not religious but then you have examples of different denominations killing each other. But you are deluded, this isn\'t just about religion or just about race. If anything it\'s more about politics than anything else. You have ISIS killing Yazidis, Christians, other Muslims, and so forth. Then you have Kurds, Iraqis, Syrians and many others killing ISIS. Then you have Iran and Turkey killing Kurds and Kurds killing Turks/Iranians. You have Saudis funding ISIS (I know, not officially, but still) and Iran funding Hezbollah. Iran is killing ISIS in the north and Saudi is killing Iranian proxies in the south. It\'s all a huge fuck fest, and it doesn\'t really matter what your religion or race is, if you align with one group, the others are probably going to try to kill you. It\'s not nearly as simple as your comment makes it out to be. \n\nIslam isnt "good" or "evil". It\'s just another religion. Some good things come out of it, and a bunch of shitty things come out of it. But it\'s much more complicated than saying "Islam is a religion of peace" or "Islam is the evil of the world". '
p392
aS'Firstly, your first argument is a loaded question - You expect me to choose to make fun of any other religion, based on your own conclusion that Islamic followers would somehow react in a way different from other religions. Now, if I were trying to be as *offensive as possible to a person from each group* I would likely see similar reactions; People are predictable and will become defensive or aggressive when their beliefs are challenged. It\'s less a matter of religion or culture and more due to an individual\'s personality and nature. Pretending that a follower of Islam is somehow presupposed to aggression and violence borders on bigotry. It is most certainly racist. \n\nSecondly, you must consider that their general population is growing as a whole, so naturally this would lead to increases of fellowship for Islam. [I also found an article from September of last year, indicating that ISIS could field no more than 31,500 fighters at the most](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/11/world/meast/isis-syria-iraq/index.html). Again, a small minority vastly weaker (both technologically and by manpower) than any other Western nation\'s armies; Definitely not \'endless\', either. As for them being "all over the world" the same can be said of Asians, or Whites, or Blacks, or literally any other race or creed currently in existence. A bit of a moot point, if you ask me.\n\nISIS is not a major threat, and pretending that Islam is the same as terrorism is an insult to the many families in the Middle East attempting to live normal and productive lives.'
p393
aS"Somebody understands!! I took the original comment as saying every Muslim is a barbarian, to which I thought was stereotyping a few billion people on the planet wrongfully so. I can see where people could make the argument for its violence through its violent history, but it's not like Christianity and Judaism's history was all sunshine and lollipops either. \n\nThe actions of the few do not necessarily represent the beliefs of many. Think of all the Christians that bicker amongst themselves on things like gay marriage, abortion, etc. You can believe entirely different things but still have the same religion. For crying out loud ISIS and Al Qaeda are declaring jihad against each other and they're both some twisted version of Islam. Think about the Westboro Baptist Church for example. They call themselves a church but anyone with two brain cells could tell you how incorrect that is. \n\nI'm really startled to see all the blind hate for an entire religion just because of a few nut jobs. Did not expect it. I get how the news portrays a painstakingly accurate stereotype, but you have to realize how many people are NOT on the news everyday for terrorist acts. That's why it's on the news in the first place, NOBODY likes or condones those actions. "

p398
aS'Thank you for this post.  I\'m atheist, and live in a country with zero Muslim influence, and I\'ve been hearing more and more about radical islamists and as much as I wanted to think "well, these guys are like the insane southern baptist Christians" my thought process would continue to: "There\'s just a lot more of them and they immigrate all over and they refuse to adapt/integrate hmm" and was starting to see why some of my friends who are otherwise rational and peaceful and I\'ve always respected sound downright hateful and bigoted talking about Muslim immigrant problems in the areas they live in. This definitely helped put some perspective on it all. \n\nThe only thing I wonder though, is how can this effectively be stopped?  ISIS seems like as much as an idea as it is a force. How can this idiotic and barbaric thought process be stopped without creating more and more like heads of a hydra by martyring those involved?  Seems like a lose lose situation to either combat it or ignore it. Definitely the US and Saudi powers are heavily to blame, I don\'t doubt that at all.\n\nWhat I really want to ask you, because you seem very connected to this and educated about it, if you had all the power, and money and decision making power in the world (no superhero powers, just basically ruler of earth) what would you do to try to fix this?  Not trying to straw man or anything here, just generally curious because again, I can\'t really see a solution myself. '

aS'"Islam and Slavery are not one of the same."\r\rI think ISIS disagrees with you. Sexual slavery has now appeared in their foul little caliphate, and they\'re practicing it specifically because it\'s condoned by their religion.'
p400
aS'He didn\'t attempt to abolish slavery in any way. He condoned and engaged in it, to the point of making up verses in the Quran that allow it, and hence in a sense commands the Muslims to engage in it perpetually (which is why ISIS has no qualms about doing it today). Abolishing slavery looks like abolishing slavery, look at Western history in the last few hundred years for examples. Telling your followers how to rape slaves, selling and buying them, does not equal "attempted to abolish slavery" in any way, shape or form. Wherever there\'s been Islam in the last 1400 years, during and since Mohammad, there\'s been slavery justified by Islam. And those justifications aren\'t implausible at all.'

I am sure they have measures to drop some tear gas, or exploding rubber ball thing... my point it this seems (the story, ISIS claims) sketchy and the Iraqi army was really really bad but now, seem to have improved a little.

In all honesty, I really don't blame those people for their sentiments and wanting a way of life contrary to the West. We have become hives of materialism, exceptionalism, greed and destruction. From an outsider perspective, I can see why they want us gone. In our quests for dominance, money, and control, we use the poor, the old, the destitute as a fuel source. It's always been that way. It only matters when the burning starts flicking flames up the upper-class. We need to stop letting the properties of our lives be handed over so easily and with impunity. \n \nWar has never been about honor, pride or what is right. Only money, power, and influence. Every. Single. War. (except maybe WW2). Soldiers are looked upon with dignity and honor for defending (insert country name), when in reality they are tools used by the rich and powerful that deserve more than just a life dedicated to killing.

The core leadership issued a decree that it's fighters shouldn't target public buildings anymore and they have strict media rules. I've seen some reports that showing beheadings is now banned, as opposed to ISIS ways. I saw another report about when AQAP took over a city in Yemen that they didn't parade there troops through the city at all, just told the people to continue living there lives. I think AQ realized they can't lose the public support, which really cost them in Iraq. There branch in syria really took a 180 from ISIS and I think it's really benefited them. With at least not being so openly brutal they've been able to recruit extremely well in syria and largely avoid coalition airstrikes. However, it's mostly just advisors and handling the money issues that AQC provide, there branches are largely autonomous \n\nISIS is the hottest Islamist militant group right now but there are differences in AQ and ISIS ideologies. If you follow some of their accounts they regularly post essays and videos on why the other are like apostates and shit like that. In the end it's all about power. The AQAP leaders who spent all this time building these groups aren't just going to rollover and hand over power to ISIS guys. sure there will be some defections but ISIS has to beat AQAP first. "

Saddam Hussein was put into power by the US and Britain. ISIS was created by former Hussein party members and is manned by former Iraqi Guard soldiers armed and trained by the US to help fight Al Qaeda (and were later discharged by the Shiite majority government installed by the US). \n\nAs Will Smith said, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.

How do you justify the pope preaching violence, and killing ISIS when that is pretty unarguably in violation of the most basic and used set of rules in Catholicism(the 10 Commandments)?  Did Jesus kill pilot and jump down off the cross with a machine gun, mowing down the Jews who tried to kill him?  No.  He obeyed God's laws(thall shalt not kill).  Even unto death.

There are about a quarter of a billion people that fall under that broad category. I think you are intending to say fundamentalist evangelicals.\n\nWhich, while also incorrect, is somewhat more plausible. Lord\'s Resistance Army is "high control group" or cult. Calling it Christian is akin to calling David Koresh\'s group Christian. I mean, you can do that if you want. But at some point it loses all definition.\n\nFundamentalist Christianity does have somewhat broader support. But it is in no way similar to ISIS, or the Taliban. I\'m not saying they don\'t have significant issues. Of course they do (rejection of evolution, etc). But saying they would "rival ISIS and the Taliban if they had their way" just has no connection with reality.'

A lot of these idiots who cry on a daily basis over every ISIS horror story don't realize that there's actually an ENTIRE country that not only enforces the same system of laws and punishments as them, but are also suppose to be the US's bestest buddy in the Middle East. When you describe the War on Terror, it almost sounds like a bad joke; the US declares war on an ideology that's being funded by their strongest ally in the region (among other allies in the region as well) they're fighting in with the US being fully aware that this is happening.

aS'Yes they have. The main opposition to the Syrian government backed by the US has been Sunni extremists for decades. \n\nIn the period following the Second World War, the US has engaged in covert operations and coup attempts in Syria due to their support for Socialism and Russia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Syria\n\nThis means that the primary choice of opposition was radical Sunni Islamists due to their rejection of the inherent secularism of socialist leaning governments:\n\nhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-s-uprising-in.../29221\n\nThis has lead to decades of violence and conflict between the Syrian government and the Sunni radicals, and terrorist attacks against Syrian Christian and Alawite minorities. The Sunnis due to their lack of political dominance in the country have instead resorted to terrorist attacks against civilians and government officials in order to oppose the secularism of the Syrian government, the government forced into a position to protect Syrian civilians has lead to increasing violence between the two factions.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Syria\n\nUnfortunately, Syria\'s current uprising is not secular or based on the desire for democratic reform. The majority of the Syrian protesters and rebels have always been dominated by radical Sunnis who have wanted a government based on Sharia.\n\nSyrias uprising is not a secular one. Most participants are devout Muslims inspired by Islam. By virtue of Syrias demography most of the opposition is Sunni Muslim and often come from conservative areas.\n\nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/.../islamism-and-the-syrian.../\n\nIraqi politicians stated numerous times that if the US backed the Syrian rebels it would destabilize Iraq, which as they called, happen exactly as they said it would.\n\nThe idea that secularists and moderates ever had a chance to be the dominate rebel military opposition in Syria is a nonsensical fantasy. -Patrick Cockburn\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2E8XBnQVfE\n\nAnd the current conflict is no exception in the regard to the intervention of the CIA, US based NGO\'s military support, and the support of key US allies for Sunni Islamic terror groups:\n\n[We Helped Build ISIS Admits retired Lt.

Alot of the oil producing countries Saudi included, didn't forsee the US  fracking industry exploding like it did which helped plummet prices .\nIf anything it'd be more logical for saudi to of cut production to fuck irans economy up and to drop prices low enough to slow the US shale production as it's more expensive to frak then well like the saudis.\nAs for saudi arming ISIS, go read http://www.conflictarm.com/ the latest reports are showing ISIS has multiple areas to gain weapons, they've found Chinese rifles as well as tracked recent shipments all the way to sudan. Not to mention all the shit they've taken from iraq, yrmen, libya, and syria.

Dresden was at the height of WW2 vs. the fucking Nazi\'s who were indiscriminately killing civilians en masse for years prior.\n\nThis is vs. isis in a small scale conflict.\n\nNeither really have much wrong with them to be quite frank. Dresden is only talked about because the US is held to a higher moral standard than the rest of the WW2 participating countries. If the civilians were warned - which the article says they were - sorry. That\'s just what happens when conflict happens. It sucks, but what do you expect everyone to do - let ISIS walk around freely?\n\nEven them "Indiscriminately" isn\'t holding up per the articles own wording. The article clearly states the reason for them bombing these structures, after warning civilians, was because the targets were using them.. which seems to be a reoccurring theme in the Islamic wars. Sure, the Saudi\'s probably aren\'t super trustworthy but at least their story is quite plausible.'

aS"&gt;ISIS using American arms is not prima facie evidence that Americans gave them those arms.\n\nThis is very true.  We do not need to give people arms directly for them to get them.  And along this line, we do not have to directly supply evil people to be responsible for them being armed.\n\nISIS has a lot of military gear that they seized from the Iraqi government.  If the US supplied the Iraqis and then abandoned them in the face of enemies which to whom they could only submit and aid or die, are we not responsible for the aid given?\n\nEdit: I don't think the US is not responsible for ISIS anymore than they are responsible for the Iraqis to be fair.  But we like to think we are intelligent and responsible, so while we are not to blame for ISIS atrocities, we may carry some responsibility for the opportunity in which they occurred."

aS'Those "finer nuances" are sometimes needed and sometimes they aren\'t. What happened in Iraq after the war (the De-Ba\'athification) is pretty much the equivalent idea to the Denazification after WW2, just that in the case of WW2 it *failed* and in the case of Iraq it was *successful*. \n\nOnce a foreign power can be perceived as effectively costing more than half a million people their lifelihood you create an extremely nourishing environment for extremist movements instead of somehow magically creating peace.\n\nIn that sense ISIS is the result of an extremely aggressive and invasive post-war policy in a foreign country.\n\nThus "ISIS exists because of America" or "America creates ISIS" isn\'t exactly a summation that needs more nuances.'

aS"Um, you got it wrong. ISIS is the spontaneous organisation of people who were directly harmed by the american post-war policy because they ended up unemployed due to their affilation with the old ruling party.\n\nImagine a totalitarian system where you need to be in a certain political party to get a good job and promtions as someone who studied engineering or is working in the military. Your country gets conquered and now everyone who was associated with that party is removed from his position *no matter why or how he was associated with it*.\n\nThat's the basis of ISIS, *not* the people who were originally opressed by the totalitarian regime."

aS"Also consider that most within the U.S government understand this and want to end this perverted relationship as quickly as possible. But what do you do? Just turn the oil economy on its head and hurt millions of lives through turmoil by ending it overnight? No, that's irresponsible so you need to try to first end your energy reliance on them. The way to do this is to look 2 fold at first how much oil you can produce domestically though investment in things like offshore drilling or shale and secondly to bring other emerging technologies onto the main stage like solar. \n\nI'm just saying, a lot of people pretend as if it's some great hypocrisy that the U.S. is allied with S.A. but really it's more like having an unsavory amoral uncle that your embarrassed you know but is your only good source of gas, and you need gas to get to work in the morning. \n\nThe U.S. needs Saudi right now and the big domestic support of fracking and shale despite some potential environmental consequences is due to the need to de-fund Saudi; it's ironic if you think about it, environmentalists are really helping terrorism through hurting domestic energy efforts and slowing our weening from Saudi's tit. Every dollar worth of oil sent to the Saudi's helps then reinforce their Islamic theocracy based on Wahhabism which is the ideology that all the bad guys like Osama and ISIS are all about. \n\nThis sheds some context on why the Saudis are desperately dropping the bottom out of oil to stop both emerging domestic sources and alternative energies. When you've got a lot of something you want to raise the price as high as possible but not to the point that your addicted customers look for alternatives. S.A. got greedy and allowed U.S. shale to exist by $60+ barrels. At $35 barrels, shale doesn't exist and even R and D companies like Tesla struggle. Saudi wants this\n"

They cross trained with Colombian groups ( that are ran by the CIA) and UK had enough. So the US CIA ended them...the thing is, everytime CIA/ world intelligence does this shit they split the group into 10 new groups by way of nature...its how the IRA came from its super religious back ground to a terrorist organization...  Scarily similar to how ISIS is formed from the extreme al' qaida...\n\n\nThe shit you read in the newspaper is not everything that actually goes down.

The foreign fighters become disillusiond when they realize they're not fighting for a Caliphate, they're being used by former Baathists-turned-Jihadists as suicide bombers and cannon fodder to overthrow the government in Baghdad.\n\nIf you fail to see how that relates to someone defecting to what they view as an ideologically similar political entity, like, say the USSR, and then becoming disillusioned with said entity after working in a factory and living there for almost a year, than I don't know what to tell you."

That's how y'all got Gulf War Syndrome. By the second war, disposal had become difficult due to the aforementioned destabilization and expiration of Saddam's ancient munitions. US troops didn't touch those chemical stockpiles in the second war, as handling expired munitions is perilous.

The US is against the Houithis since they're an Iranian backed militant group that overthrew the Yemeni government that was friendly to the U.S. It has absolutely nothing to do with ISIS, you're just attempting to make connections where none exist. The whole Yemeni civil war is the government vs. Houithis vs. ISIS. Since the government is ALSO fighting ISIS, by your logic, you supporting the Houithis is supporting ISIS.\n\n&gt;You're arguing your opinion\n\nNo, I'm arguing that the title is wrong since it says Saudi Arabia was bombing indiscriminately without warning, the exact opposite of what the article says.

p540
aS"I disagree, because you simply don't have the right to hand over your daughter to protect the rest of your family. It's not about saying what I would do. It's about determining what is the actually moral choice in this situation. \n\nI mean, I will freely concede that I would probably not resist the Nazis if they were occupying my city. But I like to think that I would also not be forced into participating in any atrocity, simply to save my own life, or that of my family, or anyone else.\n\nAnd such an action would hardly be unique. In Iraq, ISIS is executing doctors who refuse to treat its wounded soldiers. That's not even actively participating in any atrocity. But they feel that bringing these criminals back to health is wrong, so they refuse to treat them. Threatened with death, they still refuse to give in.\n\nThat is what I admire. I don't admire people who will sacrifice their own daughter for whatever end. No end can possibly justify that."
p541
aS"&gt; So the real question you might be asking is whether sacrificing the entire family impacts ISIS negatively. \n\nI can understand why you think it might be relevant, but I believe it to be completely irrelevant. I also object to the framing of this issue. This is about refusing to do an immoral act, no matter what the consequences. It is ISIS that then decides to slaughter your entire family. \n\nThe father doesn't have the right to sacrifice his daughter to 'save' the rest of his family. \n\n&gt; If not, then it's much harder to justify letting everyone die or one person live a life where they wish they were dead. What does everyone dying accomplish?\n\nLet me ask you something. Suppose you had 6 children, and ISIS told you that they would let one live, if you would behead the other 5 yourself. Would you do it? According to your utilitarian philosophy, you should. But I think that you won't, because deep down you realize that nothing justifies a grossly immoral act.\n\n&gt; I don't think there's a clear answer but I'm not sure it matters who you admire. That's more about your own emotional satisfaction. \n\nMy point was that recognizing right from wrong is one thing, and putting it into action is another, when you're being threatened. "

They are not a threat to any nation at all. Calling them weapons of mass destruction is like referring to a 16th century musket as an assault rifle. It's total bullshit. The stuff we found was unusable, unstable, and dangerous. But capable of mass destruction? Nope. The chemical weapons program was completely abandoned and in disrepair.

Anyone wanting to run away from ISIS should be encouraged and anyone running embraced.\n\nThe conflict in the middle east and in the world generally is fueled by poverty, ignorance, desperation, and fanciful idealism. To act like teen girls from britain joined ISIS or wished to join ISIS for the express purpose of raping babies is ludicrous and goes to show your own perverted state of mind, and the minds of those who find agreement with your sentiments. \n\nMost people who see negative coverage of ISIS assume it is merely western propoganda. Are they going to believe the western media when the western powers have spent the past two decades dropping more bombs in the middle east than have been dropped in history up to that point? What about the 500,000 children that the Clinton administration helped kill in Iraq with all of their glorious freedom loving bombs?\n\nThe West discredited itself with huge segments of every population int he world capable of paying attention. It is not unreasonable for them to assume that the words of ISIS leaders are legitimate and a new world, a new *just* world exists and that is what ISIS fights for. Or maybe as children and teenagers sometimes do, they want adventure and excitement without a conception of the cost and consequences. I have worked in the field of mental health including children and the very idea that these people should be tortured by ISIS for your own amusement is as ridiculous as it is disgusting. Quite a feat for you there. \n\nPerhaps you and the rest of the ISIS critics could do something about Western powers toppling Governments and arming extremists so that they may carry out their horrific crimes before you so joyously celebrate the rape and torture of the 'right people'.\n\n"

And only a small minority of Muslims are radical islamists.\n\nAll radical islam has to be targeted and addressed. \n\nTheir views are pretty obvious: they want some or all of the shariah law implemented, they hate jews, they call for fight against what they call "infidels", many mutilate and oppress their women. \n\nThis is really a no-brainer, but enablers like the lost lefties (aka rebels without a cause) are seeing this as a Cause Celebre, and are ready to defend radical islamists who would slit their throat at the first occasion.

aS'&gt; This is why I don\'t understand when people say they were too young to realize the severity of their actions.\n\nThat\'s a bastardized paraphrasing of what the law and science say.\n\nYes, they can be aware at an intellectual level that ISIS has committed atrocities.  Yes, they know that they are allying themselves with these people.\n\nThe reason there are laws to protect minors is because the [human brain does not fully mature until around age 25.](http://hrweb.mit.edu/worklife/youngadult/brain.html)\n\nIt is particularly believed that the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with planning, problem-solving, and related tasks, is not fully developed which can hinder responsible decision-making.\n\nSo at a biological level, they can be considered physiologically and psychologically hindered in making rational decisions.\n\nNobody is saying "16 year olds don\'t know that murder is wrong."  Almost any child knows that.  It\'s that the part of the brain that normally jumps in and says, "Hey, we shouldn\'t murder this guy" isn\'t fully developed, so many believe that it is unethical to try these people the same as fully matured adults in many cases.  The former example is knowledge of morality, while the latter is moral regulation of one\'s actions.\n\nAnd all of that is without even taking into consideration how much more malleable and easily influenced a teenager is.  An authority figure or loved one can hold significant influence over younger people who don\'t have the life experience to compare against what they\'re being told.\n\n\nThat being said, I have no sympathy for these girls and they should be punished.  It\'s not like this was a crime of passion or anything like that, they made a calculated decision to join a group associated with heinous crimes against humanity.  I don\'t think they should have their entire lives ruined, but they shouldn\'t be allowed to just walk free right away when they have known ties and sympathies to a terrorist organization.'

They don't have the ammunition or supplies to maintain a full scale war for more than a couple days, if that.\n\nLots of the equipment you see in their parades are literally just mockups painted to look like the real thing.

aS'Training can encompass anything that\'s a skill they didn\'t have or were less experience at before but gradually became better at through practice. Everybody expects terror cells and insurgencies to train their members in the usual simple bomb making strategies etc. But ISIS has shown they\'re a very adaptable and multifaceted organization. Who\'s to say they\'re not training these "poor innocent girls" to make and spread poisons, or to use social media to influence opinion from a domestic standpoint and among people who they actually know? There is a lot of risk in welcoming these girls back because we don\'t know what they\'ve learned to do from people who, remember, come from a region that has been war\'s favorite colosseum for like 4,000 years. It\'s not just about looking for the people waving bombs or firing guns anymore. \n\nForgive me if this sounds rude but I feel like a lot of your idea of terror cells is too similar to TV drama. They do a lot of work besides just running chemical labs and building bombs and importing anthrax that is actually very harmful. Maybe they\'re setting up further networks of residences where more ISIS members can stay if they infiltrate? Maybe they\'re going to do recruiting... Hell with the media attention around them all they\'d have to do is figure out a way to discreetly communicate and wait for people with similar sentiments to seek them out asking "is it worth it" or how they did it.\n\nMaybe I\'m a cynic, maybe I\'m a nutbag.

Luckily, I was never in the situation where my naivet or general teenage sense of alienation (theirs perhaps more acute due to minority status) could be exploited to such an extent where I would end up doing what these girls did. There are men working in Britain who are brainwashing these young people and exploiting their fears, it's why ISIS is described as a cult, because it is.\n\nLook at the people who leave Scientology after giving thousands of dollars to them and for years ignored critical media or dismissed it as propaganda. They are shocked and beat themselves up for ignoring those tell tale signs or dismissing the naysayers for so long. Granted, they're not killing people but I have no idea what these young people are being fed.\n\nIf this story is true then the girls need to be investigated thoroughly to ascertain whether they committed crimes and dealt with accordingly. If they did not or intelligence services are confident that they were coerced then practical intelligence can be gained from them and they could serve as a powerful propaganda tool against ISIS not only internationally but as a voice to those young persons that may be tempted to join.

So it is a complicated issue and people like to simplify it into 'US is evil, they made terrorists because they want oil' but in reality these problems emerge from a desire to make the middle east a better place.

Putin was god almighty, Jesus reborn and if you said ANYTHING wrong about him you\'d be downvoted. Anyone else remember that? How about Kony, reddit?

Not saying that they deserve to be forgiven, just saying that I can comprehend them doing this in the name of gaining some higher virtue. I'd say the same for 16 year old boys.\n\nAs for the girl's families, how can any family be so disconnected? I live at my house with my parents (in my country, moving out is considered being irresponsible with your role in the family unless you *have* to for some reasons), and my mother can instantly recognize a shift in my mood or thought patterns. She asks me what's wrong, she tells me I'm acting like a jerk lately, or she compliments me for gaining control over my sudden anger bursts, she notices, so does my dad! How can someone just turn into a sympathizer of a hateful group and not be noticed by their family? I believe the growth conditions in which these girls grew up is to blame. They either had fanatical parents all along, or did not receive enough guidance and attention in their crucial growth years, especially in their bad times."

When they found out that the medieval attitude and treatment would be extended to them (and it wouldn\'t all be fun facebook updates and instagramming takeouts), they decided to run away. \n\nSo in other words, once they realised ISIS were going to *treat them as they treat every other woman* they decided "fuck no" and decided to head back to the evil Western democracy they previously believed should be attacked and destroyed.\n\nThey are, at best, hypocrites if not war criminals, and frankly I have no problem leaving them to face the justice they would gladly impose on others.'

It will be about how the only entertainment aside from drone hide-and-seek and committing crimes against humanity is listening to beardy guys shout about the Koran all afternoon.\n\nIf I had the time, the ability, and didn't care about being murdered I'd consider a go-fund-me for this.\n\n\n"

Some are romanced, but most are told to hate the west, hate infidels, (non muslims),  The fact that these girls are already Muslim is glossed over by the media.  They are fed crap about the countries they live in and take advantage of.  Two Bosnian girls from Austria were radicalized by imams...and their parents did nothing to counter the arguments.  I bet they knew nothing of the US involvement in the Bosnian war, and how we fought against the folks attacking Muslims. Anyway, the reports were they were both expecting, and now one is said to have been killed.  Both had contacted their parents wanting to come home.  \n\n\nUnderstand that a kid sitting in front of her lap top does not, out of the blue, get a message from some sneaky recruiter dude..she has to *actively* go seeking these people/forums.  It is like those assholes caught with child porn on their pcs who swear it was accidental..yeah, right.  What bull shit. \n\nAs for being underage, yeah, I hear you.  I know that bit about brains not being developed, and all that...but so what?  Their brains are developed enough to know right from wrong.  They are old enough to read, to understand that ISIS is going after other humans, and that they are gang raping little girls.  These young ladies who have headed off to join ISIS deserve the shit lives they end up with.  They are actively helping a group that hacks to pieces whole villages...and these girls know this fact all the while they are packing their bags and sneaking out of the countries who have given them free health care free schooling and low cost housing.  Do not fool yourself into believing these girls do not know what ISIS is about, they know, and they like it, and they are stupid enough to think that they will get some glory.  So, let them get raped, they had no sympathy for their fellow human sisters already victimized, let them get murdered for the crime of changing their minds.

Prior to ISIS's invasion of Iraq they had not gone up against any major military power (Assad attacked everyone but ISIS because if him and ISIS were the only choices people would pick him) and even when they invaded Iraq the Iraqi army was a complete mess. Since then the Iraqi army has been rebuilding and Malaki is gone. ISIS is waging a war against the majority of Iraq, a war they lost last time it was fought, only now they have also are fighting the Kurds, Al-Qaeda, Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US and its Western partners. Even if the US pulls out because of lack of political will there is still going to be A TON of political will in Jordan, Iraq, Kurdistan, Saudi Arabia Iran and nearly ever faction in the Middle East will still be in the fight against ISIS. They are fighting a conventional war except unlike actual states they don't have conventional means of acquiring the sinews of war. Their money comes from smuggling gas, looting the places under their control and ransoms, many of their fighters are conscripts or at the very least don't actually believe in the cause and their weapons are all stolen with no manufacturing basis. Basically ISIS has no means of fighting the long war against the entire Middle East and the only question is what will the region look like when they are defeated."

p666
aS"Agree completely. ISIS represents the second phase to the Sunni Shiite civil war that was raging in Iraq when the US was there last. The reason ISIS is around is in large part because of Maliki and the brutal oppression of the Sunnis under his regime. This created a legitimate grievance ISIS could hijack to restart the war. ISIS will be defeated but if retaliatory politics are once more the norm and this doesn't change then I don't see how a third civil war will not occur sometime in the future. We had political efforts before and they didn't work, let us hope that the second time is the charm."
p667
aS"The civil war from 2006-2007 was arguably worse, as more people were dying day to day, but the government didn't lose as much territory as it has to ISIS. The surge resulted in an 90% reduction in civilian deaths in 18 months, and the Sunnis and Shiites were able to reconcile enough to get quorum in the Iraqi parliament and finally pass crucial laws that were needed to get the new government off the ground. Maliki has a lot to blame for the current situation and the problem will not be solved until Iraq's sectarian politics are smoothed over. But ISIS was a shell of itself in 2011 compared to what AQI was in 2007, and the outbreak of the Syrian civil war allowed some of the most battle hardened jihadists in the world an open playground to reconstitute themselves. It's just bad luck for Iraq that the same year American troops left was the same year the Arab Spring erupted. I have less optimism now seeing as how difficult it was to secure fragile gains in the 2007-2009 time frame with 160,000 boots on the ground. "
p668
aS'To stop them you have to come up with a true democracy in Iraq. While the US was occupying Iraq there was a brutal civil war between the Sunnis and Shiites and the Shiites (being larger than the Sunnis) were able to get their guy, Maliki, as prime minister. Once the US left and Iraq was no longer in the news Maliki purged the Sunnis from office, aligned with Iran, and became known as the Shiite Saddam. When the Syrian civil war ocured a group called Al Qaeda in Iraq, who had fought and lost in the Iraq civil war, started fighting in Syria and grew in power. Al Qaeda headquarters refused to recognize them as Syria\'s official Al Qaeda group and instead choose Al Nusra Front as the official branch causing "Al Qaeda in Iraq" to rename themselves ISIS, break from Al Qaeda and invade Iraq. Due to Maliki\'s politics and political purges there was no clear command for the military and no loyalty to the government so the Iraqi army fled instead of trying to fight and ISIS took large parts of territory. Sense then Maliki has been sacked and the Iraq government and army is rebuilding while also at war but the Sunnis still have a legitimate grievance against the government. If a power sharing agreement is not reached then this legitimate grievance will remain until another militant Sunni group comes along attempting to overthrow the Iraqi government. A power sharing agreement is the only way to achieve actual peace.'

When US troops (mostly) left Iraq, there wasn\'t a stable government, there was massive sectarian violence, rule of law was a joke, AK-47s were floating around like tea in England, and bombs were blowing up in Mosques, marketplaces, and motorways. ISIS was born out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, an organization that formed during the US invasion and occupation. The assholes of ISIS didn\'t all of a sudden "show up". They never left nor were they ever neutralized.\n\n&gt; They will keep losing ground till all they hold is Mosul or till Mosul is isolated (which it almost is now). \n\nHow can this armchair general possibly know this? By looking at charts on CNN? Sunni insurgency is going strong in Al-Anbar province and who knows how many small towns in the North and West of the country.\n\n&gt; Once Mosul falls their HQ is in Syria making it easy to push the remaining troops out of Iraq and secure the boarder.\n\nSecure the border of Iraq and Syria? Do you know what that border looks like? I\'m assuming you\'ve never been to Iraq before, because if you had you\'d know how ludicrous your statements are.

This is because Islam did not have the strength or armies to fight anymore. The newer Islamic fundamentalism of the 1900s (now reaching it\'s peak) was a more suicidal/bizarre belief system: believing that they **can** fight, despite being weak against European/Asian powers. They believe they can fight against horrific odds because "God is with them". They\'ll send children to their death.\n\nISIS is the latest mutation of Qutbism (the AQ/ISIS religious ideology).

Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her."\nObviously most western Christian would never consider this part of their religion but it is a significant part of the bible.\n\nThe Quran,likewise, is a large and contradictory book.  It says in one part "treat everyone the same no matter their religion" and in another "kill all those against our religion."  Most muslims don\'t consider the second quote part of their religion.\n\nThe ISIS question:  ISIS is absolutely a rogue part of the muslim world.  Literally every country with troops fighting ISIS on the ground Muslim.

All you have to do when you see him say this is ask yourself, "Who benefits from him saying this?". \n\nDoes ISIS benefit? no, now the whole world (including Muslims) is enraged and more united in fighting them.\n\nDoes the Iraqi/Syrian Civilian benefit? no, they are the people actually fighting ISIS.\n\nDoes the average Muslim benefit? no, now its even harder for them to say "Islam is a religion of peace". Another boot in the face and this will only incite more ignorance/confusion towards the religion.\n\nSo who really benefits from him saying this?\n\nI sum up why ISIS are not Muslims with logic [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/34hynk/to_muslims_can_you_name_one_thing_that_isis_is/cquxcwf?context=3) and with the same quranic verses they use to incite hate [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2fz0xu/woman_slapped_by_two_men_for_parking_her_car_in/ckeaj6g?context=3). \n'

aS'Most of the comments here are crazy stupid. People who keep arguing in this website and real life that Islam as a whole is bad, then suddenly come and say that yeah, the leader of fucking ISIS is right. "see, he confirms it!" \n\nThis dude wants all gays killed, legal slavery, and execution of infidels, and people on reddit are saying he\'s right about the whole religion being evil.\n\nFuck those Muslims trying to live a decent and peaceful life elsewhere, and those who are getting killed by fanatics of another sect of their religion, right?\n\nGet a grip, people.'
p694
aS'Upvoted, because you\'re right, kind of, I was mistaken because Jihad doesn\'t always mean a physical war. Political measures and economic measures (like sanctions) could also be considered Jihad, war is actually the least common form of Jihad throughout history. \n\nBut Jihad can be a war within Islam, or a war against non-muslims, the point is to protect the true meaning of Islam (something ISIS is not preaching). \n\n&gt; ["If military jihad is required to protect the faith against others, it can be performed using anything from legal, diplomatic and economic to political means. If there is no peaceful alternative, Islam also allows the use of force, but there are strict rules of engagement. Innocents - such as women, children, or invalids - must never be harmed, and any peaceful overtures from the enemy must be accepted."](http://islamicsupremecouncil.org/understanding-islam/legal-rulings/5-jihad-a-misunderstood-concept-from-islam.html?start=9)\n\nMohammed would have considered the perverted version Islam that ISIS is following to be completely against what he preached, and he very well could have (and probably would have) ordered a Jihad against them because of it. \n\nMy point is, it doesn\'t really matter what the 76th leader of ISIS said, he follows a twisted and distorted version of Islam that goes against what Mohammed taught to his followers in the first place.'
p695
aS'Yep. If the question is "What would Muhammad do?" the answer is "Exactly what ISIS is doing".'
p696
aS'What Baghdadi doesn\'t understand is that there are so many more "infidels" than ISIS members in this world, that we(the rest of the world) are getting tired of his shit, and are about to just slay his whole ISIS thing once and forever. He sees our christian mercy as weakness, what a fool...'
p697

These guys want to kill everyone who\'s not a Muslim while converting everyone they can to their version of Islam, right?\n1.) How are those two things not mutually exclusive?\n2.) What does ISIS think will happen when everyone\'s a Muslim? How can there be a "final battle" when there\'s no one to fight against? And when this final battle happens, what next? Does Allah come down to create a perfect world for all the good ISIS soldiers?'

p703
aS"I would also like to add that shifting climates throughout the past have changed where is arable and where isn't. Arability of land affects the common man's quality of life (and his ideals). Majority of these violent muslims live in desert wastelands. This leads to a poorer quality of life. The Europeans and Asians live on much better land and do better as a result. The Iranians also do better as their land is more arable than the deserts of Arabia. Same with Turkey (the head of the Ottoman caliphate). The Fertile Crescent where ISIS is located is almost all desert now. Not a good place raise a healthy, secular family."

aS'ISIS is a big cult. It\'s a death cult that believes they\'re bringing about the end of the world- Al Qaeda has the same ideology.\n\nIf you\'re interested in the subject I highly recommend Graeme Wood\'s article "What ISIS Really Wants".

aS"ISIS is more internationally known.  It's really more about circumstances right now though."
p708
aS"ISIS follows a bizarre, 7th century literalist scholarly interpretation of Salafi Jihadism. The important thing to know about Islam is it is absolutely NOT monolithic - it's practice is entirely up to scholarly interpretation. \n\nISIS's interpretation is a psychopathic Wahabbi-inspired Salafi-jihadist interpretation - like a Nazi-meets-Calvinists-meets-Westboro-meets-Jonestown interpretation of the Bible. Imagine Christians who seriously believe that Revelations is currently upon us.\n\nIslam - like every religion - is diverse, and it is simply incorrect to ever refer to it as meaning a single, simple thing."
p709
aS'True, but I am discussing the use of holy texts being taken to the extreme by a select small group inside of the whole religion. \n\nSo in context:\n\n&gt;Every Peaceful Muslim:\n\n&gt;SON OF A BITCH!\n\nSo when ISIS/Westboro go on crazy rants about how there way is the true holy way, and the rest of Islam/Christianity who is more sane and secular, collectively face palm.\n\nNo one could or would argue ISIS is worse of the two, but each are "the worst" crazy people of their respective religion.'
p710
aS"But my point is that they are successfully conquering lands and building an army.\n\nPrevious jihadist organizations were not acquiring [hydroelectric dams](http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/03/world/meast/iraq-crisis-isis/) to further fuel their war machine. ISIS is in this for the long game. They are strategically picking their targets to control resources and population centers. This group is dangerous in a way Bin Laden never was. Bin Laden never had the man power to launch a full blown invasion, but that's ultimately the goal of ISIS. Iraq and Syria are just the beginning."
p711
aS"It's interesting you bring up the New Testament; according to Islam, if you were to deliver the original Aramaic Bible, Muslims would have to follow it just as they follow the Quran. Muslims believe that the Bible, Torah (Old Testament), Psalms, and Quran in their original forms are the true word of the same God. However, as history shows &amp; according to the Quran, those books no longer exist in their original form and have been changed by man through incorrect translations, misinterpretations, &amp; politics. Sort of like Muslims are facing now--the difference being they have the original Arabic Quran to look back to regardless of the ridiculous claims ISIS makes. So it's difficult to answer your question because we would need to look at the original Aramaic Bible to discuss accurate differences in teachings. With that said, as I have been trying to say is, different circumstances call for different measures. So if God does exist, it is completely understandable for me to see how rules might be different for Jesus' time and circumstances, Moses' time and circumstances. and Muhammad's time and circumstances without contradicting each other (I.e. War may be acceptable in times of defense, but not in aggression)"
p712
aS'Obviously ISIS is a plot by SERN to destabilize the world.'
p713
aS"That's not how any of this works. ISIS is not a nation-state that can be dissolved. It is not a race that can have genocide committed against it. ISIS is a manifestation of an ideology. How do you fight an idea?"
p714
aS"Were the Crusades religiously motivated? Is Christianity a religion of peace? The Bible endorses the same behaviors endorsed in the Koran. It's not a religious thing. It's a human thing from a more ancient and brutal time. Religion can be a beautiful thing, but you can't cherry pick the good from one and the bad from another to draw your value judgments. I would argue the Crusades were politically motivated, but religiously sold to the people. This is ISIS. \n\nWe will never defeat an enemy we do not understand. We will never defeat an enemy that we continue to play into the hand of. The first thing to understand is that ISIS is a political organization, not a religious one. They may use religion as a vehicle for recruitment propaganda, but their ultimate goals are political and their leaders couldn't give a damn about Islam. You can tell because they have killed more Muslims (Shiite Muslims, yes, but Muslims nonetheless as they are one [Umma](https://www.google.com/search?q=umma&amp;oq=umma&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l5.504j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=umma+islam)) than any other group. ISIS is an interesting mutation of terror organizations in the Middle East as they are the first (at least in the last couple decades) to legitimately pursue statecraft. Keep in mind, they're primary motivation of taking the battle from Syria to Iraq is their refusal to recognize the [Sykes-Picot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) agreement. This has been made explicit by ISIS. \n\nIt is also important to remember that ISIS is not made up of bloodthirsty barbarians looting and pillaging the desert haphazardly. They are calculated. They know their enemy. The reason they behead journalists is because they know it disgusts the West. It makes you feel. To make you FEEL vehemently is exactly what they intend to do. When you are angry, disgusted, vindictive, you make emotional decisions instead of calculated ones. This is exactly what is happening to Jordan right now. They are getting more and more invested in a fight that has the potential to ignite a growing [refugee crisis](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/jordans-quiet-emergency/374803/). Notice it's never a well-adjusted middle class suburban kid who joins ISIS. It is routinely the isolated and disenfranchised. For this reason, I worry especially for Jordan, but I also worry for Western nations. \n\nThis brings me to my last point. Islamophobia is playing into the hands of extremists. For every [xenophobic protest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZiTreKcCk), for every [Pegida rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJaiJ_maUEY), for every veiled [Islamophobic message](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-is-too-tolerant-and-should-interfere-more-in-peoples-lives-says-david-cameron-10246517.html) or legislation, we are disenfranchising groups and increasing their sensitivity to recruitment by ISIS. So I implore you, as a matter of national security, go out and meet a Muslim. Discuss Hijab with a woman choosing to wear one. Ask a Muslim what Muhammad says about peace. Ask how their religion informs their life on a daily basis. If we are going to value diversity, we need to take a hard look at the degree to which we self-segregate. \n"
p715
aS'Cause ISIS is clearly the authority on accurate interpretations of religious text.\n'
p716
aS'Well, Islamic nations are fighting with ISIS.  \n\nBut it\'s obviously more complicated than that.  Sunni v Shia division... Tribalism... etc.\n\nBut yes, Muslims ovviously fight with each other over who the "true" Muslims are, who do you think ISIS is killing by the hundreds?  All of the "apostates" in their eyes.'
p717
aS'This sounds like a recruitment speech; a very large portion of the world\'s Muslims are at least sympathetic to the idea of violent Jihad. He\'s trying to encourage those that are sitting on the fence to join him.\n\n&gt; Does ISIS benefit? no, now the whole world (including Muslims) is enraged and more united in fighting them.\n\nReally? People are going to be more angry over him saying that he wants to kill then over ISIS actually killing people? It may actually happen, but I doubt that\'s his intention.\n\n&gt; Does the Iraqi/Syrian Civilian benefit? no, they are the people actually fighting ISIS.\n\nYep, they don\'t benefit, in fact it\'s likely to harm them, since this is likely to increase recruitment for ISIS\n\n&gt; Does the average Muslim benefit? no, now its even harder for them to say "Islam is a religion of peace". Another boot in the face and this will only incite more ignorance/confusion towards the religion.\n\nYeah, I doubt Baghdadi cares about them. (I\'m not convinced that they are the "average" Muslim either; except in Western countries)\n\n&gt; So who really benefits from him saying this?\n\nPeople trying to recruit violent Jihadis. Potentially the counter-jihad movement in the West may benefit by using this to encourage the rest of the West to join them or stay out of the way.'

aS"Huh? ISIS isn't a religion, it's a state. It's in the name... \n\nIf we're talking states killing Muslims, the US has killed way more than ISIS."

p720
aS'&gt; In the near future, we need real-life battle shows. ISIS vs North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea would fare very well in open warfare, I think.\nOffensively, their ballistic missiles and subs make even Russia take notice. Defensively, they have the largest army in the world.'
p721
aS"That's fair.  The way you word it would lead one to believe that you think the CIA created ISIS and are wondering if others share that belief.  ISIS is an offshoot of Al-Qaeda which was formed in the 80s and did receive aid from the CIA to fight the Soviets, but the idea of an Islamic Caliphate goes back to around 650 AD as a way to pronounce a successor to Mohammed after his death."
p722
aS'Who do you consider their own people?  All Muslims?  Have you not been paying attention?\n\nThe middle east has Arabs, Kurds, and Persians.  Then, of those races they have Muslims, Jews, and Christians.  Of those religions they have many sects.  There are Sunni Muslims and Shia.  \n\nISIS is made up of Arab Muslims from the Sunni sect, but not just any Sunni sect, a fundamentalist one.  They have been killing Kurds, Shia Muslims, and Christians.\n\nJust because they are all from the same region doesn\'t mean they are "killing their own people".  That\'s an incredibly ignorant view of what\'s going on over there.\n\n(I\'m not an expert, there are probably sects and/or races involved that I forgot.)'

That is why people are outraged when they are in danger. They were also outraged when ISIS started killing, but they did so many terrible things since then that, sadly, this is what you expect them.\n\nWhen you read about their "weekly evil doings", you just cannot help but go to the next page.'

But I don't blame Muslims for ISIS.  Rather, I'm simply pointing out the fact that what ISIS is doing is very similar to what happened under the early Caliphs (where do you think they got the idea?)"

aS'Why does ISIS have beef with Australia anyway? I noticed in one of their speeches they singled it out from the western countries.'
p730
aS'Yeah you would hope so. However, to them, shitty is being rich and having free choices in a society to marry who you want and to speak your mind without fear of retaliation. They abandon their Western jobs to join ISIS because they WANT to be commanded, they want arranged marriages, they want to live only by religious commands, they want to die for God.\n\nYou understand their mentality? They don\'t see Boko Haram ruling a city, or ISIS ruling a city as "shitty". They see it as progress. They see it as being closer to God and obeying his commands joyfully.\n\nDo the Amish hate their life with no electricity and computers? No. They think they are living a great life. This is the same thing except filled with violence and horrific laws (but only to us it seems that way).'

The countries being shouted out to by isis are the ones the people who really control isis, want to lose more civil liberties. \n\nEVERYONE in the five eyes network is facing the same thing. Rapidly expanding survelience state, removal of free speech, talk about labelling types of thought illegal, militarisation of the police etc etc. \n\nYou need an enemy to use as an excuse to structure a country this way. Its what the nazi\'s did. Its what every regime does. External threat, remove freedoms for "safety". The path is the same every time. Its the rise of global fascism rearing its ugly head again.'

But we asked ourselves can we draw the penis when the Apostle of Allaah() is among us before asking him about it? So we asked him about it.

This mirrors the killings done these days to protect the honor of Muhammad or the Qur'an. \n\nMuhammad also ordered the beheading of about 600-900 Jewish men while their women and children were sold into slavery and sexual slavery. Muhammad forcefully married one of the women, the wife of the tribe leader, that night after her whole family was massacred on front of her. This mirrors what ISIS did with the yazidis. \n\nMuhammad ordered the destruction of the temples of the old gods in Arabia and one hadith tells about how there was a woman protecting and her head was brutally split in two by a strike with a sword. Exactly how ISIS is destroying old archaeological and historical sites today. "

aS'Well why don\'t you go join them then? Or are you just using what you have just said to increase your dislike of Islam? Either way that is "Kafir" according to Islam. Because under the first scenario you are willing to go overseas to fight alongside ISIS, which kills Christians, Muslims and Cildren. And under the second scenario you are willingly increasing your ignorance of Pure Monotheism.\n\nThe back and forth squabbling over scripture is a common feature of religions yes, this is why Muhammad declared the four books of Islam to be the Torah (delivered to Moses), Psalms (delivered to David), Gospel (delivered to Jesus) and that if any differences were found between then, the Quran would be correct, and there would be no alteration or addition to the scriptures after he (Muhammad) is gone. Yet just about everything ISIS uses to spread fear/hate does not come from any of these texts but rather "hadith". \n\nJust because Baghdadi has a PhD in Islamic studies does not mean he is right, nor that it isn\'t accurate to accuse him of not "being clear". \n\nIt is quite sad that in today\'s world one could spew forth the rhetoric you align yourself with (that he is a good true example of a Muslim, and he knows his shit), with very little proof and be agreed with by many. But another person could say that Baghdadi is an impostor and that he was born in Israel and trained by Mossad to lead and carry out Operation Hornets Nest in an attempt to destroy Iraq/Syria so that the plan for Greater Israel can finally come to fruition 150 years after its inception, backed up with proof, and be called an idiot/conspiracy nut/anti-Semite. Truth is, we will have to wait and see.'

How about Europe pay forward the insane amounts of money we got from the Marshall Plan to the Middle East? It would help curb the flow of desperate refugees and would help alleviate the collapse you describe."

As if Al Qaeda and ISIS started the idea of honor killing a gay son or daughter who had sex outside of marriage or who refused to marry her first cousin. \n\nMuslims have been butchering their own kind long before these  modern political terrorist groups came about. You do not live in a culture that allows an uncle to kill a niece for refusing to marry his son and not only not go to prison but actually get hailed as a fucking hero then get to turn around and say how "peaceful" that same culture is. These terrorist groups had rich ground to recruit from because of how violent Muslims are towards each other.'

They are contained.  Homemade rockets are warfare, compared to ISIS having actual artillery.  If Gaza tried to fight Israel head on they would be annihilated and Israel would get what they wanted.  I feel like they understand that.\n\nIt is important to note, I don't mean to claim I am right in any of this, but I believe the man talking to me was talking from his heart, and not indoctrinating me.

The out of job soldiers and modern weapons were just tools giving impact to the anguish felt by millions in the country. ISIS is the consequence.\n\nWe see this happening in Yemen. Dropping water table, sheer desperation has led a large part of the country into AQ's hands, while Houthis and Saudi-backed groups fight over the rest. As oil prices remain stable or further drop, we will see the whole middle east fall into chaos.\n\nWhen the Saudis were trying to pull Pakistan into their coalition against the Iranian-backed Houthis, a senior minister had this to say 'The Saudi regime can last for not more than two decades.

The numbers are just for reference alone. But even lowly Austrlia's military budget is a 30 billion a year.

Countries with rising spending power like India and China will continue to drive demand for oil for the next 50 years.  \n\nIt's also important to remember that a lot of rebels currently fighting against ISIS are secular and have a real desire to create inclusive governments representative of everyone.\n\nHitler was able to thrive because at so many opportunities those who had a chance to stop him did nothing.  I can guarantee you that will not be the case in the Middle East with so many western interests involved.  If you think for one inure tthey the United States would let any large organized group threaten the safety of Israel, Jodan, Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, you are crazy.

aS'Am I the only one who thinks this subreddit has gone full retard?\n\nThere is a warning of a potential terrorist attack and we have responses like =&gt;\n\n|"Well when you consider ISIS is an artificially generated, military industrial complex sponsored,"\n\nUpvoted? Seriously what drugs or religion are you people on? Given the past, yes it is likely that there will be more Islamic terrorism in Australia.  Intelligence services pick up this and publish it because that is what they are paid too do. However so many here are obsessed with political overtone despite the constant string of attacks and attempted attacks against various western countries in the past several  years. Looking at the complete mess that is the middle east, it is likely to continue. The more successful attacks there are the far more restrictive and over seeing will spy agencies become and yet all people here can do, when attacks are occurring in a repeatable manner is complain specifically about such warnings. If you are blaming restrictive laws on our government instead of issues with an ancient religion I think you have misplaced the root cause.\n\nNow if intelligence services do not act then it is likely that more attacks would be successful thus escalating problems even further as well as the restrictive laws. We have a religion that generates and empowers extremist to the point that what was once the cradle of modern civilization is now a mess beyond description and yet all people can come up with here is: \n\n|"Well when you consider ISIS is an artificially generated, military industrial complex sponsored,"\n\nAn entire region of multiple countries have all ended up in a total mess and are largely unable to exit that mess due to extremist being empowered in those countries as a function of Islam, a pattern which is fairly replicable across Islamic countries around the world and through various time periods regardless of outside interaction.  It is to the point that its effectively a statistical ensemble.  If we want to maintain multiculturalism without specifically dealing with the issues around Islam due to the taboo of political correctness then it is likely that we will incurr more restrictive laws to prevent terrorism as the population responds to the threat of bombings and beheading and similar. In this manner the mass population(average sheeple) and how they react will lead to this later.\n\nRemember, agencies that give these warnings generally don\'t want too. Each time they give a warning and nothing occurs they look bad.  Whats more, for the people working at those agencies it means more work and more overtime resolving associated issues instead of going home to their families.\n\nI find it quiet interesting, that this subreddit, instead of looking at the root cause, which as 99% of large scale terrorist cases happen to be closely related to islam, rather look at a government and people trying to respond to that threat and minimize the impact. Yet in leaning this subreddit, leans to the left, which tends to science like and against things like "religous chaplains in school", and supportive of vaccinations. Islam however on average tends to empower people who are far more to the right and extreme of "religions in school" and being against vaccinations as is seen in many examples in the middle east. Yet so many here avoid that obvious link in contradiction with the values they display.\n\nYes it can argued that we, as part of the west are part of the stabilization of the middle east.  However part of that problem, is that Islam empower those with extreme ideals in those countries. Due to its ability to empower those who are extreme, it weakens the societal fabric that makes those countries very fragile and easy targets.\nIt has in effect made them easy targets for our corrupt and thus our implication.\n\nI would argue that the following is likely, and not really a choice, but more likely a statistical outcome that is probable regardless of who is in power:\n\n1.There will likely be more terrorist attacks associated with Islam. It is likely that Islam, as a function of its own contradictions within the world for which we live, will always lead to a small percentage of its follower engaging in very undesirable behavior such as terrorism.  In the case of countries where it is significantly dominant, those countries are likely to have instability regardless of outside influences as a function of the issues with islam.\n\n2.Non islamic countries, as a response to terrorist attacks will have their populations demand more action from governments over time.  They see an obvious and simple threat to their daily lives on average and will demand action. Governments that get into power will oblige. We as a result will loose freedoms.\n\nI would argue some of this may be mitigated by:\n\n3.If a dialog is started, openly non aggressively, from the LEFT, that there are problems with Islam that need to be changed in order for it to be compatible with modern **multicultural society** then their is a chance that we may reduce terrorism to the point that it becomes "insignificant in the publics eye" and we can start increasing our freedoms as we should.The line of dialog should be along that there is a small percent of people from islamic backgrounds, as a function of islam, that are empowered by islam to do terrorism is an unacceptable percentage as compared to those from other value systems and as a result islam needs to change in order for its followers to meet standards such that its followers commit terrorist attacks at a rate that is in line with the rest of the population.\n\nI would also argue that this line of dialog will not work, as it is now, where only right by enlarge criticizes the issue with the religion and that is because the right on average tends to be overly aggressive with the deport them or hang them all argument.\n\n4.In order to reduce short term impacts, the west in general needs a longer term discussion about weather its proactive interventionist policy in middle eastern countries is correct.  Should we adopt a stance similar to china\'s no interference policy? Should if we intervene, such as the US in iraq, be required to stay in order to ensure that said country does not deteriorate into a worse mess in such way as to take responsibility for our past actions?  Perhaps we also need to work on a system of accountability for our politicians which currently seems to be lacking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

Like all religions, unprovable claims for the afterlife are made in exchange for behaviour in the real world. There is no experiment to test competing claims.

Khomenei could always rely on a heartfelt cheer after a 'death to america!', 'death to iseal' (hi NSA, just an internet discussion on world geopolitics), but they weren't even able to win a war against a petro dollar funded soviet client state. And Iran was pretty modern in 1979. The middle east is a demoralized, half destroyed hell hole outside of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. There can be no real ISIS war machine, and the only thing a million strong, slightly mechanized, infantry dominated land army is capable of is being cannon fodder or the instruments of oppression and genocide re: Africa.

aS'Before you went on your rant about Christianity, I understood your explanation on why the first verse is nice and innocent.  Simple translation error, it happens.  \nBut the point I\'m trying to make is specifically the second verse. The one you\'re choosing to interpret based on the first one so it isn\'t as violent, but on its own is declare war on any non-muslim.  \n  \nThat\'s why I say ISIS takes it litteraly, the second verse doesn\'t say "Fight those who threaten mecca", or "Fight those non believing invaders". It says "Fight those who do not believe in Allah". '

aS'If by literally you mean stupidly, you\'re right. They take it stupidly. \n\nDid you know the Qur\'an has various bits of punctuation for when to start/stop reading? These are called [Alamatul Waqf](http://www.quranreading.com/blog/rules-and-signs-of-stopping-waqf/). I don\'t know why I bring this up specifically, except to say we have a lot of rules and notes on interpretation of Qur\'an. You can\'t just extract a line from it. You\'re reading a translation of a work of poetry. For one thing, it\'ll sound horribly wrong. Secondly, there are so many hafiz or people that have read the book hundreds of time, that you\'ll get called out on it immediately. My grandmother, for example, can hear a line of Qur\'an and tell you the next few lines verbatim, she\'ll know the context and the surah (chapter), she\'ll know if you changed *one letter*, and she\'s certainly not exceptional. We read this book religiously, repeatedly. We read through the entire thing every time a loved one dies. Our prayers consist of the first chapter of the book (17x daily obligatory), plus 17 other chapters of the book daily (usually we pick the short ones!). The reason I bring up the Christians is not to rant, but just to point out : this is not the equivalent of citing the Bible, it\'s entirely different. You can\'t just fudge up a line of Qur\'an for a sermon. It really can\'t be done. It\'s uniquely recognisable poetry. "[Then bring forth a surah like it](http://www.answering-christianity.com/surah_like_it.htm)" the Qur\'an challenges, and nobody has yet done so.\n\nThe problem is that young kids and converts don\'t know yet, that\'s why ISIS targets them. They\'re the only ones ignorant enough to follow ISIS. There\'s a great sermon about this from someone who is one of the top US scholars right now [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJo4B-yaxfk) (ISIS have ordered his and his colleague\'s executions for this video).'

aS"Well, I don't think that is a real possibility outside of fiction and sensationalist pontification. To clandestinely deploy brigade sized units to fight guerrilla warfare in Western nations would be almost impossible, especially with electronic surveillance in the state it is. To equip them, and maintain any semblance of command and control seems utterly implausible to me. The mass exportation of radicals is certainly happening though, considering that a mere percent of the worlds Islamic populations would be millions strong. But outside of their intelligent, and likely ideologically duplicitous leaders these exports would be no more effective than similar sized hordes of soviet emigres were during detente. And at least the soviets had some moral relevancy to their 'cause' which resonated with westerners, and a well organized modern super power as support. If Islamic radicals are met with tolerance and generational time-scale levels of patience the war with Islamic fundamentalism will won with shaved beards and economic growth. ISIS is an existential threat to only those people living with and beside their centers of power who have to deal with their barbarism. They would be easier to defeat by alleviating the economic status and educational woes of the population bases they draw support from, than better arming and equipping neighboring territories and traditional middle eastern allies. Not that I'm sympathetic to their cause, when you have cancer by all means - use radiation and chemo. But if you're healthy and neglect diet and exersize  because those treatments exist and are continuously improving you're asking for trouble. "

aS"Thanks for asking. This in a point of view of a person that grew majority of his life in US and childhood in rural Bangladesh under fairly devoted moderate muslim parents, and I only saying this as other areas of people may question explanation. Anyway, When I was growing up, my parents did the typical thing every muslim parents do, which is to send their kid to madrasa (religious teaching school - equivalent to Sunday school) where they would tech all the kids how to read Arabic and recite the Quran. Its a hard thing to read if your native tongue in not that language. throughout all the teaching, there one thing that always stuck, which was a question, how will we know when day of judgement come. There are quite few narrative written about it, some with fairly strong chain of narration, some with weak. So we know that major part of Quran just repeats the stories in the bible or torah, which are all about War that was conducted and called upon by God, so you can see how it is perceived that the definition of religious life boils down to struggle. So the violent nature of the book really does dawn upon the people who are trained to never question it. skipping fast forward a question is asked to muhhamed about how his followers will know day of judgement will come, the signs are as follows:\n\n1. Death of Mohammed - pretty self explanatory, when he does, things start falling apart and god starts the time clock on the end of the world.\n2. Fire in the west - this was rather a vague sign but scholars have sometimes described as an actual fire and other time as turmoil in the west which lot of the uneducated muslims relate to the current arab world struggle with the west occupying their country and space which creates anger.\n\nskipping few minor signs (in my opinion)\n\none of the last one is the last struggle. This is suppose to be a fight between believers and non-believers. This story relates to the coming of the messiah and reincarnation of Jesus. The story boils down Jesus being the savior (muslim's believe he will return as a follower of Mohammed and not as a Christian). The story portrays and ending with the believers winning and living in peace amongst each other. What ISIS is doing is reiterating this fictional story that almost every child around me learned and saying that the time is here. We need to fight for our religion and get to the peace.\n\nI left out lot of the story as it can get very long to discuss in detail but hopefully you get the picture why these assholes say is the religion of fighting against infedels. It also doesn't help that the Quran mentions a struggle that happened during Mohammed's time when he was conquering Mecca. I can tell the story if you want to hear it.\n\nSorry no TL;DR, this is the short version."

QURAN doesn't encourage Muslim to terrorism. It is a matter of sorrow that for ISIS and other Islamic terrorist groups activity people started believing it. They are devil.

You can find out by reading about the Arab Revolt.\n\nIt may be time for you to hit the books though. Arab Muslims have a long history of Wars and conflicts.  Some of it has to do with oppression by Western Nations, others have to do with them wanting to just expand."

aS"I mean it's not me that disagrees with Baghdadi, it's a large number of non-retarded Islamic scholars.\n\nJust because acts are carried out in the name of Islam, doesn't mean that they were motivated by it. I could blow myself up in the name of Reddit, yet nobody would blame Reddit. Suicide is explicitly forbidden in Islam yet suicide bombings are the goto tactic for terrorist organizations.\n\nWe should really consider the social, economic and political issues facing the Muslim world when trying to explain why the Middle East is a disproportionately violent place. In the case of Islamic terrorism, acts committed in the 'name of Islam' tend to have a very clear political motivation. No major terrorist organization in the Muslim world has been grounded solely on the grounds of ideology. Al-Qaeda was founded during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and recruited from all over the Middle East by portraying the conflict as a religious struggle.\n\nThese organizations use twisted Islamic rhetoric as a means to compel their followers. This makes strategic sense for terrorist organizations because if people believe that the atrocities they commit are in line with certain religious principles they are more likely to act. Violence is a product of observable factors like power struggles and oppression; not ideologies like Islam that are completely open to ones interpretation.\n\nAs much as you'd like to think ISIS is killing thousands because a book told them to, that's a gross oversimplification. Religion doesn't exist in a vacuum. "

aS"Good luck with that. The Saudis and Turks won't do it because ISIS prefers killing Shiites and Kurds. Syria can't do it because the US is determined to overthrow Assad's government, rendering their military ineffective and occupied on multiple fronts. Iran can't do it because the Israelis and Saudis don't want Iranian influence to expand and when the Iranians do help out they get blasted by Marco Rubio-types for being 'hegemonic'. Egypt has Libya to deal with and has enough trouble stifling extremism within its own borders. In short, the only Middle East nation with both the interest and capability to crush ISIS is Iran. Until we acknowledge that and figure out a way to work with the Iranians, ISIS and al Nusra will continue to wreak havoc in the region."

That the US would support the Saudis in that fight speaks its priorities.\n\nAs for Iranian involvement in fighting ISIS in Iraq, they are absolutely helping, but that assistance is limited and ISIS operates outside of Iraq. The Iranian military can't do anything in Syria or the Arab countries to combat ISIS because of resistance from the US, Israel and those Arab countries themselves. Given that political realities are preventing a coalition between those countries and Iran, military success against ISIS, al Nusra and AQAP is also unlikely."

aS'After the latest comment from IS leader, I think it\'s very clear they intend to turn the world against Islam. That they want some war to come about that would bring the end days.\n\nI just don\'t understand how they think *any* god would want them after all they\'ve done and continue to do. After reading this from they wikipedia article for Devil(Islam)\n\n*"The primary characteristic of the Devil is hubris.[2] His primary activity is to incite humans and jinn to commit evil through deception, which is referred to as "whispering into the hearts".[3] The Quran mentions that Satans are the assistants of those who disbelieve in God: "We have made the evil ones friends to those without faith."[4]"*\n\nI wonder if their motivations are actually evil, and they (ISIS) are liars about their faith. They definitely "whisper into the hearts" of people they recruit. They manage to convince them that Islams god is okay with raping children (does the reason matter?), among other things most religions would consider entirely evil and without justification.  \n\nPersonally, I have emotions sometimes that make me want to denounce all of Islam as a bad religion that has no place in the future, if humanity is ever going to find peace. But that is wrong, ISIS does what they do with the intent of making me and the rest of the non-Islamic world feel that way.I think they have perverted, and twisted your religion for this. I may never understand how they find that acceptable. It\'s perplexing to think about.\n\nI believe your message is shared by the vast majority of Islamic peoples. My rational mind manages to push out narrow minded emotions. If anything, I\'m interested in such a controversial religion that walks such a fine line in peoples minds. In the western world we grow up with images of religious figures being white, all media depicts Noah, Adam, Jesus, Moses as an ethnicity they just couldn\'t have been. Until ISIS made me wonder why they thought it was okay to do they things they do, I had no idea how closely tied Christianity and Islam are, historically. \n\nIn my mind, I have decided ISIS stand completely alone. I am enraged at them, not Islam. Even though my mind becomes emotional sometimes, I am not going to hate so many people irrationally.'

aS"And there are hundreds of Islamic scholars who disagree with Baghdadi. The Quran is absolutely open to interpretation and the central point is an entire ideology it can't be condensed into peace and violence.\n\nWe should really consider the social, economic and political issues facing the Muslim world when trying to explain why the Middle East is a disproportionately violent place. In the case of Islamic terrorism, acts committed in the 'name of Islam' tend to have a very clear political motivation. No major terrorist organization in the Muslim world has been grounded solely on the grounds of ideology. Al-Qaeda was founded during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and recruited from all over the Middle East by portraying the conflict as a religious struggle.\n\nThese organizations use twisted Islamic rhetoric as a means to compel their followers. This makes strategic sense for terrorist organizations because if people believe that the atrocities they commit are in line with certain religious principles they are more likely to act. Violence is a product of observable factors like power struggles and oppression; not ideologies like Islam that are completely open to ones interpretation.\n\nAs much as you'd like to think ISIS is killing thousands because a book told them to, that's a gross oversimplification. Religion doesn't exist in a vacuum. \n\nI'm just going to come and say, I don't like resorting to personal insults, but it takes a very specific kind of mindset to hold such a narrow minded and frankly idiotic view. You're saying that the 1 billion peaceful Muslims in the world, the thousands of moderate Islamic scholars are wrong and Baghdadi along with yourself and a bunch of xenophobic bigots got it right thousands of years after the founding of Islam. Yeah that makes perfect sense."

In other words, I am talking about the specific thing known as ISIS or just the Islamic State. Which is why I used the name ISIS!\n\nObama betrayed an important Arab ally in Egypt and conducted a grossly pre-mature withdrawal of troops from Iraq. It is clear to me that he is directly responsible. ISIS was able to have such a great impact in Syria because they were able to organize relatively unmolested in Iraq. After their gains in Syria, like a wave in a tank of water they swept back into Iraq to seize territory there. Neither event would have occurred had America maintained a reasonable presence in Iraq. As countless experts warned that America should do. And the Syrian civil war would never have blown up without the fall of the Egyptian regime to serve as an emboldening example.'

aS"&gt;ISIS held territory before the withdrawal of troops in Iraq.\n\nAs far as I know, this is not true. Do you have a reference of some kind? No militant groups held territory as far as I know. They existed and of course being something that exists they existed at some place or another but they were underground. They may have even declared what they believed their territory to be but held less actual control over it than a mafia gang holds over some neighborhood they say they control.\n\nI'm talking about controlling territory as a defector governing authority, not just being the local bully that gets away with quite a bit but ultimately has to keep an eye out for the legitimate ruling authority.\n\n&gt;You're attempting to pin the blame on just a figurehead and not the parties that are responsible as well.\n\nIt was Barack's words, publicly demanding Mubarak to stand down that set the one half in motion, his adamant insistence on troop withdrawal against all counsel being the other half. I would normally agree that individuals do not drive history in this way but Barack Obama in these instances was positioned to knock down fundamental supporting structures of the entire region and he did so solely on his own authority."

p903
aS'I never said the terroristic action by those people was good, but what I said is that Israels reaction to it was unjustified and could be labeled as terrorism, which I supported with facts.\n\nAnd also your comparison to America bombing ISIS is bad. US is focusing their attacks on ISIS, who\'re labeled as terrorists (unlike the Palestinian civilians). They also don\'t go around and arrest hundreds of people without any reason and then refuse to tell us where they\'re being detained. (Although they have Guantanamo, which should be closed, I\'m not supporting it) There are a lot of civilian casualties, many of them can be counted as collateral damage, since it wasn\'t planned to kill/wound non combatants (unlike Israel targeting and arresting Palestinian civilians, which is against the laws of war). Though I do think US should do something against the high number of civilian casualities.\n\nIf you do think that bombing ISIS because ISIS is a terror organization, is the same as Israel bombing Palestinians, because Hamas is a terror organization, then you\'ve got some issues...\n\nAnd about brainwashing, unlike you I can see the wrongs of both sides, I think Hamas is bad, it\'s a terrorist organization after all and they do shit, but I also think that Israel is bad, as they violate several laws of war, which is a fact. But you seem to overlook the wrongdoings of Israel and only see the wrongdoings of Hamas. When you hear Israel did something wrong, you completly deny it, you don\'t even try to think about it, wether it is true or not. If I post something the first thing you say is "I make up lies", while a swift google search that doesn\'t even take 1min would give you more then 10 sources to the things I said. It\'s not like I\'m completly uninfluenced from the media, but I\'m a far cry from someone like you who can\'t even see the wrongs of one side and thinks of it as justice.'

aS'Alright. First of all, calm down. We\'re having a discussion. Lose the frantic combative attitude or I won\'t even bother. \n\n&gt;We are not anywhere close to killing a leader every 4-5 weeks.\n\nI didn\'t say leader; I said senior management. And yes, senior ISIS members are killed on a regular basis. The point I was making here is that management attrition is detrimental to an organization\'s ability to function in a coherent manner. This is not a controversial point to make and I\'d challenge you to find me a respectable source that supports the notion that organizations do not suffer from a regular loss of leadership.\n\n&gt;Look at early christianity. MASSIVE persecuation by the strongest empire on earth (Rome). Did that get rid of christians?\nLook at the entire history of islam. constant internecine battle. did it end them? no.\n\nRead my post again, I specifically acknowledged that leadership decapitation does not end terrorist networks or defeat the ideology from which they have grown. My argument is not that killing leaders will destroy the network; my argument is that leadership decapitation produces operational hindrances and reduces the effectiveness of the network.\n\n&gt;Its a very foolish to buy into the western simplistic propoganda (DIRECTED AT US IN THE WEST) that these people are "just terrorists". Thats not even remotely how they percieve themselves. They see themselves as 100000% muslims religious crusaders, not as "an organization" as we see them in the west.\n\nThe fact that they have particular motives or a particular self-image does not change the fact that terrorist networks are organizations of people. They have finances, a chain of command, recruitment practices, and objectives. \n\n&gt;Did we end "terrorism" when we killed bin laden? no. Its WORSE today. Did we end it when we killed zarkawi? No, its WORSE.\n\nNo, we didn\'t, and that\'s not what I\'m arguing.\n\nMy point is not that dismantling an organization will end terrorism or even a particular terrorist network. I am arguing that terrorist organizations are far more dangerous when they have competent, coherent leadership structures. The al-Qa\'ida of the late 1990s/early 2000s brought us the African embassy bombings, the USS Cole attack, and 9/11. These were all high-casualty, highly effective operations conducted with rigorous planning, training, and financing. Terrorist networks without effective leadership are far less capable of conducting these kinds of operations due to failures of organizational management. The disaggregation of al-Qa\'ida after 2001 rendered it incapable of conducting attacks that were even remotely close to their previous efforts. Just because they still exist does not mean they haven\'t suffered from the deaths of their leadership. It\'s generally accepted within terrorism and political violence scholarship that AQ Central (its original formulation) no longer exists in any meaningful capacity.\n\nThere is a whole body of theory behind this. Again, I\'d recommend Sharpio\'s book if you\'re interested.'

aS"You started talking about the raid to kill an ISIS commander, now you are talking about overthrowing Assad. As you said of the Americans, you can't have it both ways. The fact of the Syrian Civil War is that large countries are backing most factions for various reasons, the country is in shambles and no one controls the country as a whole, conducting a military raid as an outside party might be morally questionable, but in this case I believe it was for a good enough reason and it had no affect on the civil war being fought except to perhaps weaken ISIS supporting fighter groups.

Since the beginning of coalition bombing (US bombing, really), ISIS recruitment numbers have sky rocketed. \n\nAfter more than a decade in Afghanistan, they are still around.

aS'Well that was dissapointing. The article does nothing to deal with the issues in the first article. The idea of saying: *"Probably no other country in modern history has suffered such a terrible streak of violence."* is laughable. There are plenty of countries that have had more suffering. Really ISIS started in Syria more than in Iraq and just took advantage of weak government and extreme religious views. That doesn\'t change their sense of destiny, more likely it reinforces those views.\n\nAlthough I don\'t agree with ISIS, I can certainly see why they have their world view. They are purists in the extreme sense and ignore the things that get in their way like the hadits which are man made/selected. It is a bit like the books chosen to be in the bible and those that were excluded.'

Maybe that terrorism is such a small threat in a country that the protection is what\'s scarier, is a sign that the protection is doing a pretty good fucking job.\n\nNow, I don\'t necessarily believe this.

ISIS is big now in the news, slaughter is public and shown around the world. Everything they do is to sensationalize, some of what they do is supported by those in the areas they control. They are horrible. \n\nSaddam didn\'t publicize his exploits. Seeing 2 gay men thrown off a high rise is terrible. Seeing 30 Iraqi Kurds gutted is terrible. \n\nHaving entire towns gassed by Saddam is terrible. Having your entire way of life, culture and community wiped out - in addition to most being killed - is worse in my opinion. You\'re talking not only of friends and family killed, but in essence their community history and past. When I was there, people still were talking about Saddam (this was 2009/2010). \n\nISIS is terrible, Saddam was terrible. You can replace ISIS with Saddam, and the only group in Iraq that would be safe would be the Sunni areas. That\'s the same with ISIS. The only difference is that if Saddam was still in power, you wouldn\'t be hearing about these atrocities or maybe even care. To the people on the ground it would be just as bad, or worse. '

aS"I am genuinely curious to hear what those who keep defending the success of the coalition airstrikes have to say now. \n\nI had previously argued that analyst and military experts agreed that the air strikes, while important at halting or rerouting ISIS could not ultimately defeat them. \n\nWhat is required to ultimately defeat them is ground force. Who should be the boots on the ground is another story. \n\nThe WSJ even reported today that the air strikes have been ineffective. Despite people's feelings, the fact remains, that Shiite and Iranian backed forces have had the most success in areas where ISIS has been pushed backed. "

aS"I think we're each assuming two things, and granted, neither of us can be positive beyond a shadow of a doubt, so I'm figuring this will turn into a toss up.\n\nI'm assuming that\n\n1. The girl's remorse will be genuine. I think that if they made the choice to flee and come back, then that's because they realized how terrible their choice was and want the safety of British society and not that they are a sleeper cell for ISIS.\n2. Even if their remorse is an act, then the professionals at the jail will be able to know whether or not they're faking it. Again, they're sixteen and foolish enough to think that running off to join ISIS was a smart thing to do, so I'm not convinced they're Hannibal Lecter-level liars capable of fooling trained professionals. I think that if they were lying about being remorseful, then counselors and therapists would see through this and deny them any early release.\n\nYou, I'm guessing, think the opposite on both counts.\n\nI haven't heard them being directly implicated in any specific murders or operations, only that they joined ISIS. So my thought is that if we let them back in, one, they can be rehabilitated into peaceful members of society, in which case no one benefits from the continued expense of locking them up, and two, if we show mercy, then it will encourage others who are maybe still novices with ISIS to run away, and maybe provide us with some intel or secrets, or at least rob ISIS of manpower.\n\nISIS has, to my knowledge, a substantial stream of foreigners joining its ranks. If we take a hard line against those that want to leave and stop being terrorists, it sends a message to all that there is no turning back, and that they had better double down because its victory or death."

aS"Not gonna happen. ISIS was able to take most of the Sunni areas of Iraq but they wouldn't be able to push very far into Shia areas without  an enormous amount of resistance.

In that case, Saddam's military was not irregular and their soldiers locations were strategically monitored on satellite.

As you said, the only way to effectively destroy and route them once they  take position in a city is to raze it to the ground, which is unacceptable. Airstrikes could also down their advances but it's harder to locate them especially when they are using non-standard military equipment like civilian vehicles and bulldozers. "

So now you have a real risk of even a minor conflict going nuclear. After all, what good is having that one nuke if you're not going to use it....  \n\nThere is also the risk that some of these countries are linked to terrorism. You have very little to fear from the weapons in say the UK, France, China, US and Russia because they generally maintain good control over their weapons and they have reasonably well functioning governments. Some middle-eastern countries could be considered supporters of terrorism or are so close to terror-supporting countries that the weapons might fall into the wrong hands. Just like how ISIS took over military bases in Iraq. Scary thought, right?"

If the U.S. were to help ISIS gain traction in countries such as Qatar (40.3 tons per year per capita) or the U.A.E.

What do you think is going to happen when Assad falls to these ISIS led terrorist groups?  You think they are going to set up a stable country with a pro-US government?

You have ignored this three times no matter how much rhetoric you want to use to pretend like you haven\'t. \n\nAgain, "terrorist network" and "insurgency" and "large army" are not mutually exclusive.\n\nMy argument is that managing these elements of an organization requires expertise and experience. Killing leaders (and senior commanders) has an effect on the overall quality of the organization. I\'m **not saying it will destroy the network**. I\'m saying that it degrades the network\'s capabilities and forces it to adapt and focus on areas it would rather not. If you think this is stupid, then publish a paper on it because you\'d be the first.\n\nYou\'re right. ISIS is a very large organization. This fact **strengthens** my argument. Managing large organizations requires skilled leaders and, like any organization, maintaining leadership stability is important. This is all I have been arguing. Tone down on the zealously and read what I\'m saying and you\'ll see that.'

They get involved in Afghanistan and arm the muhajadeen against the Soviets. A couple decades later the muhajadeen are now the Taliban, using US weapons against them. The US arms Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. Saddam uses US weapons against them.

The city of Fallujah was pro-American and secure so there was very little U.S. forces there. After former Baathist and foreign fighters infiltrated the city the 1st and 2nd Battles of Fallujah commenced. 1st (early 2004) Battle was 2,200 U.S. troops vs 3,600 insurgents with 27 U.S. casualties. 2nd (late 2004) Battle was 10,000 U.S. troops vs 4,000 Insurgents with 95 U.S. casualties. \n\nYou are also confusing the "paid immense amounts of money to the defending generals" with the "Sons of Iraq" Sunni tribal leaders that General Petraeus bought out to leave the insurgency at a much later date.\n\nYou are also confused with "Then after the war the USA went back on the immigration deals with these generals and abandoned them and cast them out of the new army and power structure." \n\nThere was never, ever, not in a million years going to be insurgents immigrating to the U.S. -I don\'t where you get this shit from.

aS'"Treasure trove" is of course the [same language](http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/30/opinion/bergen-bin-laden-document-trove/) that was used to describe the haul of intelligence from the bin Laden raid. Seymour Hersh\'s [article](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden) claimed the size and importance of the bin Laden "treasure trove" were vastly overstated:\n\n&gt;Why create the treasure trove story? the retired official said. The White House had to give the impression that bin Laden was still operationally important. Otherwise, why kill him? A cover story was created  that there was a network of couriers coming and going with memory sticks and instructions. All to show that bin Laden remained important.\n\n Good journalists and smart citizens should be wondering if the government is trying to pull the same trick again to make it seem like the target of the new raid was more important than he actually was. Just look at all the terms government sources have been throwing out to describe him:\n\n&gt;a leader of the Islamic State\n\n&gt;the Islamic States emir of oil and gas.\n\n&gt;a midlevel leader in the organization\n\n&gt;Al Capones accountant\n\n&gt;the chief financial officer of Isis\n\n&gt;a senior Islamic State official\n\n&gt;fairly high up\n\n&gt;directing oil and gas operations\n\n&gt;involved with the groups military operation\n\n&gt;likely in contact with Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\n\n&gt;a key ISIS commander\n\n&gt;one of ISIS\'s top financiers\n\nAnd these are the terms independent analysts are using to describe him:\n\n&gt;largely unknown to close observers of the organization\n\n&gt;not a name familiar to many ISIS watchers\n\n&gt;easily replaced'

The biggest source of terrorists are those nations where there are idle hands.\n\nLibya is a prime example. The country wasn't exactly poor nor unstable under Ghadaffi. But it had many idle hands, educated young people sitting at home with benefits because there weren't enough jobs. Then the restraint was released and the country has exploded into a cesspit of terrorism. \n\nIn truly poor countries, the people are to busy just surviving to listen to hate preachers. Notice how few of the western ISIS recruits were active members of society. Most were unemployed, giving them plenty of time to radicalize. \n\nThat's the secret, you can't just blame financial poverty. Because the fact that many of the western recruits were not poor by any means.\n\nBut far more of them were idle rich (middle class), not self made rich but their parents made it and they lived of it.\n\nAnd then you can start looking at western/white terrorism and drag in cults and wow! Suddenly we have a ton of research that matches perfect. Idle spoiled rich (as in not having to work for a living not in them being millionaires) kids looking for a goal in life. That is the western ISIS recruits.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ISIL\n\nLook at the list of number of nationals fighting for ISIL and note mix of rich and poorer countries.\n\n&gt; Netherlands: 130\n&gt; United States: 100\n\nOne of the richest countries in the world but also the smallest, more recruits then one of the largest. \n\nExplain please?"

aS'Erm... alright?\n\nNot sure how linking to me to a random song that exists about a historical thing that happened (with "the art of history" actually written clearly on it) actually supports whatever it is you\'re saying.\n\nYou read like the ramblings of a madman, with these apparent delusions about this christians vs muslims holy war that\'s going on with all these knights riding around in the middle east singing to brass bands. This isn\'t a thing that happens.\n\nWhat has actually happened is time moved on, the world moved on, other big events happened across hundreds and hundreds of years and through eras, and many generations lived and died, and humanity is now a much more mature species, with a (believe it or not) much more peaceful planet. There are populations of people who are unfortunate enough to live in a part of the world strife with war, dictatorships and religious extremism. ISIS are a group on a religious war against all religion that is not theirs, not just against christians.\n\nYou can\'t blame christianity for the state of the middle east. The middle east has always been a war torn zone - before islam or christianity were even an idea. Look at the Assyrian empire, Egyptian dynasties, the Macedonians, the Selucids, the Romans, the Timurids, the Mongols, various city states, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on. War, invasions, genocide, etc.\n\nJust do yourself a favour and step back, and realise that there isn\'t a \'side\' that you have to take. Look at it from an outside perspective and realise that these dogmatically religious people, be they in the past or present, of any organised faith, are too caught up in their own little inward-thinking ways, and so massively insecure about themselves as people, that they feel they have to forcibly make you live under the same doctrine they do. Half of them are clearly psychopaths, and I mean medically. Traumatised as fuck from growing up with practically no education, surrounded by poverty and war, and exposed to hardline extremist religion. Who wouldn\'t be mentally fucking ill? Generations of that toxicity.'
p1073
aS'Well I am not OP. I do think that the root of the problem lies in having citizens who want to join such a group in the first place.\n\nYou say authorities are "competent" enough, but most countries don\'t allow for mass surveillance and monitoring of citizens\' computer activity. If some random kid in a poor neighborhood is accessing ISIS material on his computer nobody is watching. There aren\'t enough eyes to see all of that, even if it were legal. In many cases not even the parents of the extremist know that their child has been radicalized. These people are usually isolated from their immediate social circles as they join a closed off, extremist group. \n\nAll I\'m saying is that once they *do* leave and join ISIS, and they want to come back, it shouldn\'t be a simple "oh yeah Jimmy you made a bad mistake, now don\'t go running off with terrorists again, hear?" Especially when ISIS has specifically said that they would try to get members to go "home" so that they can commit terrorists attacks in the west, such people should at the very least be imprisoned and charged with terrorism-related crimes.

When someone is immigrating, are we somehow supposed to do an analysis to guess if their future children or grandchildren will one day become radicalized?\n\nEDIT: Looks like Stormfront got in here."

Look at the 6th picture, that's a whole fucking box of night vision optics. The Iraqis can do offensive operations just fine but have problems defending outposts. Now ISIS is going to be attacking them at night. This doesn't even include the rumored 40 abrams  200 humvees they abandoned at the 8th army base in Ramadi.  \n\nThe upcoming Shia militia offensive is going to be a blood bath. They group up to much and have to much confidence because they operate in the thousands. They way they group up a single machine gun or IED can kill 50+ guys in mere seconds. If you watch some of the videos they post or from ISIS once they come under fire they start acting like chickens with their heads cut off. Straight up ISIS is beating the Iraqis when it comes to small unit tactics. The Iraqis don't need more weapons or troops, they need better officers and training. "

Dropping a hellfire missile into a street full of people is unlikely to kill anyone of value, but will kill scores of bystanders. \n\n* The Iraqis had a chain of command based on the Soviet model. It was highly regimented and orders came from the top. ISIS is more or less divided into small warbands varying between platoon and battalion size with a high degree of independence. Aside from a few broad directives, most information about future operations stays within the unit's command staff. There are no 10,000 strong ISIS convoys. \n\n* Air can't hold territory, Bashar Al-Assad gave his airforce carte blanche and they slowed the pace of rebel gains but didn't reverse it. Drones are not substitutes for ground forces, unless you plan on turning every single structure to rubble; you need ground forces to root out enemy positions and to hold territory. \n\n* The Iraqis don't have reliable ground troops, largely because of sectarianism within the military and political parties using the military as a paycheck for supporters. You have officers whose primary qualifications are influential clan members, soldiers who don't trust the government to protect their home regions (making them reluctant to fight outside their home region) and a country that is used to abuse/cruelty/neglect from different sects. For example, the Kurds pulled out of defending the Christian regions without giving the Christians any warning.\n\nThere's no political will in Washington to send in ground troops. "

Israel and the US directly support the opposition to Assad, whose army ISIS is fighting, and oppose Iran, which is fighting ISIS.\n \nIn other words, even if the US doesn\'t directly support ISIS, ISIS is doing things that the US likes. \n\nSo on the one hand, the US, "the world\'s policeman," has been forced to do something about ISIS, and is now in the awkward position of having to cooperate with favorite nemesis Iran to do so.\n\nOn the other, the US, or at least the neocons, don\'t want to do something.'

The thinking is probably: fuck 'em, they wanted ISIS, they can have ISIS. "

aS"It's pathetic really, after the fall of Iraq in Iraqi Freedom we disbanded the Iraqi military which has left us were we are today with a bunch of political suck ups filling the shoes of soldiers. \n\nSecond off, why is everyone so obsessed with keeping Iraq as it is? The county is an awkward mixture of ethnicities and religious sects that hasn't been able to function coherently except under he rule of a brutal dictator. The lines for most of Middle East were drawn up post WW1, so they're fairly new nation states without much of a track record. ISIS is an abomination that needs to be rid of, but there comes a point where the U.S. should consider the practicality of trying to uphold the state of Iraq as we know it. (Although that probably won't happen because oil). "
p1101
aS"Well, not exactly. Sure, the initial invasion into Iraq and Afghanistan may have been to secure oil supplies, but the motivations behind fighting ISIS are completely different. \n\nThe reason why more and more Western powers are coming to fight ISIS is because they fear what the organization could become. They have money, manpower, and to a certain extent, influence over the region. If they are not stopped now (where they are currently in their infancy), they would likely become a much more powerful and formidable foe. So the question is, would you rather fight ISIS now, or fight them after they've had a decade to develop? "

Their loyalties are to their tribes and families. When shit hits the fan, they are abandoning the national defense, and going to protect their homes and villages.\n\nThe actual Iraqi army within ISIS, however, not only knows the terrain and the strenghts and weaknesses of all the strategic points and cities in the country, but have actually trained to fight on that very terrain. They have little to lose, and fierce burning rage for the fighting to avenge their humiliation at the hands of the new Iraqi govt, including the execution of Saddam."

aS"On the other hand 2/3 didn't receive welfare benefits, one could argue that not receiving welfare encourages terrorism using your logic.\n\nWelfare may make some aspects of becoming a jihadist easier. It could provide people with more free time to study the teachings of radical clerics. It could also assist in some of the travel costs. But it's possible the money could be sourced from other places such as shady charity organisations and unknowing family members.\n\nI don't think you have shown a strong causal link between welfare and jihad, in fact you've barely demonstrated a correlation. \n\nWith respects to ISIS and anti-western propaganda. As I'm sure you know, ISIS is an offshoot of Al Qaeda's Iraq branch. So one should expect anti-western propaganda given their pedigree. This has increased in frequency with the entry of western and regional powers into the conflict. Al Qaeda was created largely as a reaction to the close relationship between 'heretical' Arab states and America, so the joint aerial campaign must annoy ISIS to no end.\n\nIn any event, my main point was that young men who join ISIS and Al-Nusra don't see themselves as evil. These young men left europe driven by a confessionalistic passion to defend their fellow Sunnis. They aren't blowing up buses in downtown Copenhagen, they're manning the frontlines of a war they see as protecting their co-religious. I don't see how you can discourage people empowered by such righteousness with solutions such as suspending welfare payments or other simple solutions.\n\nOne of the reasons I think ISIS has been so much more successful in recruiting than Al Qaeda is that ISIS has a far more visceral call to arms. Al Qaeda dealt in abstractions in explaining how America was oppressing muslims around the world. It was a very esoteric argument that only found very few supporters amongst muslims. ISIS has a far more simple and less morally ambiguous message. Shiite heretics are dropping barrel bombs on Sunni villages in Syria; how about coming along and protecting some Sunnis?"

You end up playing a whack-a-mole game. You kill a bunch of terrorists, but you also cause so much death and destruction for the civilians, they end up joining the enemy.\n\nIt\'s stupid to do the same thing over and over and expect different results. On the other hand it\'s also stupid to leave the enemy alone and not counteract them in any way.\n\nObama\'s strategy is sound - he still attacks and cripples ISIS with surgical strikes when needed, while not overcomitting. That way ISIS is unable to play the "Evil Americans are slaughtering the poor Muslims again" card. It\'s hard to propagate the Islam VS West rhetoric, if most of your soldiers are fighting other Muslims.'

The Kurds put their fighters from 50,000 to 250,000. They shattered the elitie of the Iraqi troops at Ramadi, airpower alone is unlikely to ever blunt a war it can cause great damages but without using it in such a heavy and costly manner its not likely to beat them down with it. \n\nSpecial force raiders are good too but it isn't breaking the fighters off like we need to see "

We made a deal to dispose of chemical weapons, cost no lives or money.

Successfully disarming a side doesn\'t matter if you force the wrong side to disarm.\n\n&gt; Obama\'s foreign policy has been an unmitigated success. In direct and stark contrast to the massive foreign policy disasters of the prior president.\n\nMore successful than Bush != A success.

aS'&gt;The official positions of both the PLO and Israel is that they want a two-state solution and both have been willing to negotiate towards a solution. What you are suggesting is that the international community override whatever the parties to the dispute want. How will that solve the problem if the stakeholders have no say?\n\nYour reading comprehension is terrible. I said both states have to be involved in the solution, explicitly.\n\nWords are but wind. Both sides claim to be open to the 2 state solution but Netanyahu has made it abundantly clear he is not. Particularly with the recent appointment of Ayalet Shaked who literally called for the Genocide of palestinian mothers.\n\nIt goes without saying that many of the Palestinian pre-conditions for negotiation have been completely unconstructive and impossible to meet. \n\n&gt;I only disdain international recognition where it\'s based on politics, not reality, and runs in the face of international law. And the 1948 agreement was entirely correct. It had a defined boundary, defined governments, and defined populations. It abided by the rules. Yes, the lines were drawn by someone else, but with the acquiescence of the population (at least in Israel\'s case), and unlike Sykes-Picot were done after considerable study and not based on imperialist political aspirations.\n\nThe 1948 borders would be fine in my eyes, and in the eys of international law. I\'d prefer a more up-to-date solution with the same kind of comprehensive investigation that enshrined the first. However do you deny that Netanyahu is clearly not interested in appeasement or diplomacy?\n\n\n\n*Incidentally, all this talk of defining the population is moot*, in the study of International relations defining a population is secondary to simply controlling the territory and population.  Here\'s an excerpt of David Kilcullen, a distinguished academic with a focus on ISIS and the middle east talking about what defines statehood with concern to ISIS:\n\n&gt; Well, without getting too geeky about it, in international relations we normally say that a state needs to have four characteristics. It needs to control the territory, it needs to control the population, it has to have a government that exercises some form of control and it has to be capable of entering into relations with other states. So if we look at all four of those, right now, ISIS controls an area about the size of the Netherlands or Switzerland, slightly larger, about a third of both Iraq and Syria. As it\'s lost ground in Iraq and of course recently regained ground, it has also gained ground in Syria. It has a population under its control about the size of Israel or Norway or Singapore. It has a government that is not just military people; it has a taxation system and a court system, police, it runs electrical power, water - all those kinds of things in the cities that it controls. And then finally, it sells electricity to the Syrian Government, it trades oil and antiquities on the international market, it has an international spokesman and an international support network. So it doesn\'t - it\'s not a requirement in our understanding of what a state is that it should actually be recognised by other states and of course Islamic State is not recognised by any other state.\n\nSo the primary problem with a Palestinian state is that the PA does not control Gaza, and cannot control the militants and miltia who are governed by Hamas. Asides from this, Palestine under the PA in theory meet all these criteria. The PA is open (though somewhat intractable) on what they believe is there\'s, they have external links, and they have shown in the past the ability to govern and continue to govern some territories to this day.\n\nIsrael could choose to empower the PA, if it wished, rather than follow this bloody status quo.\n\n&gt;Actually most of them aren\'t. They were born into the refugee \'camps\', which are really cities, in countries like Lebanon and Syria.\n\nBorn there because their parents are refugees. That makes them Palestinian refugees. They do not get automatic citizenship from Lebanon or Syria.\n\n&gt;Are we including the ones in camps in the Middle East or the ones further afield? How many generations do we include? Are there any other requirements? These are questions that need to be answered before a projected Palestinian population can be ascertained\n\nIndeed however what you\'re suggesting is that because these questions need an answer, we should just not answer them at all and stick with the status quo.\n\n&gt;Israel doesn\'t object to Palestinians moving to a new Palestinian state, and that\'s not the issue here\n\nYou asked what the population of this state would be asking me if refugees would return. I simply said "Let\'s say yes, because it\'d be hypocritical to for Israel to oppose that idea".\n\n&gt;I am not, and have never claimed that there is no such thing as the Palestinian people. My issue is that there is no defined population for the purposes of statehood, which is a requirement under international law.\n\nThis could be corrected within a few hours if you had people around the table. All the numbers exist and this is a trivial matter for lawyers, economists and assorted social scientists. \n\nConstructive dialogue like what you and I are having do not feature in any of the negotiations or peace-talks. I do not exclusively blame Israel, both the Israeli government and various PA/Fatah/Hamas in the past have all engaged in fierce rhetoric to gain support at home that sabotaged negotations. \n\n\nThe issues you raise are trivial. Nobody has the will to fix the crisis.'

aS'I was enlisted in the army infantry, I patrolled daily and provided security during the first Iraqi elections. During 2006-07 I lived on a patrol base with an Iraqi army platoon. The Iraqis who joined the police and military have no sense of patriotism. Most of them probably joined because at one point Iraq had 70% unemployment. They\'re completely unreliable, because their sense of loyalty is to Shia Islam, their particular sheik, or anything else other than Iraq. You say "The basic strategy of using untrained and unaccountable troops and to hope peace just breaks out somehow is what I am talking about." And your alternative is, apparently, to occupy the area until peace just breaks out somehow. That will not happen before the heat death of the universe. No matter how long we stayed, Iraq would have fallen apart shortly thereafter. I was saying this in Iraq in 2007, I was reprimanded by my superiors at one point for making statements injurious to morale, and I have been proven right. The only real uncertainty was in exactly how it would collapse. And of course I\'m not saying dictatorship is ideal, it only postponed the inevitable. Iraq is unnatural, a block of land with ethnic divisions too deep to form a nation out of it. The best thing to do would be to allow it to fall apart, and to provide what support we can to those groups who are organized enough to effectively fight ISIS. Eventually new borders can be drawn.\n\nI have more reason than just about anyone to hate ISIS. Back when they were called Al-Qa\'ida in Iraq they were the main insurgent group in my brigade\'s area of responsibility during my second deployment, I lost more than one friend to the bastards and I was shot in the leg during a raid on one of their meetings. Nevertheless, doing something just for the sake of doing something, without any real hope of ultimate success, is pointless. In my opinion the initiative in the battle against ISIS, and in restoring order to the region in general, has to come from the people of Iraq and Syria, and the help we can usefully give is strictly limited. That may not be fair, we may have done a great deal to create this problem, but that doesn\'t mean we\'re capable of solving it. If we go back to Iraq on a large scale, we will hand ISIS the best possible recruiting tool, and when we inevitably eventually leave again, they will still be there.'

aS"&gt; And your alternative is, apparently, to occupy the area until peace just breaks out somehow. \n\nYes. Like it did from 08-2014 before ISIS invaded from Syria. Are you saying you never saw a difference in 07?\n\n&gt;I was saying this in Iraq in 2007, I was reprimanded by my superiors at one point for making statements injurious to morale, and I have been proven right. \n\nI don't think you were proven right. I think that allowing a superior fighting force to regroup, rearm, recruit and plan for 4 years on how they will invade Iraq is not the same as the place just falling apart after the US left. ISIS is not a civil war issue, or a new issue, it's the same enemy that you engaged. But rather than destroy that enemy, we allowed them safehavens. There would be no issue if the US and UK and any other countries continued the policy of leaving no safe haven for terrorists. But they didn't. They declared it was no longer our job, Syria was magically off limits until 2014 when ISIS invaded and the press and the people of the US and the west looked at their governments and demanded they do something. So we did. We started bombing again. We continued arming untrained and unaccountable militias. And so far, peace is no where on the horizon. Instead, ISIS is dragging those unpatriotic military and police force members from their homes and executing them in Rahmadi.\n\n&gt;Nevertheless, doing something just for the sake of doing something, without any real hope of ultimate success, is pointless.\n\nI couldn't agree with you more here. That is my entire point about using untrained and unaccountable troops and having no stated plan to stop the enemy.\n\nWe've been bombing ISIS in Iraq and SYria for a year now - I have no idea what the end game is other than keep dropping bombs, supplying weapons, and hoping for peace to break out. Do you?\n\nYou claim that you had no mission in Iraq, but it seems to me you clearly did; to help restore order to Iraq after removing Saddam. You participated in securing the first ellections in that country in 35+ years. I'm not sure why that doesn't bring you extreme pride and answer the mission question for you.\n\nWas it perfect? Did it create Utopia? Clearly it didn't. Anyone expecting that outcome is naive at best. But I am not sure how you can conclude that there was no plan while you were there - and not recognize that there is even less of a plan now and be even more critical of it.\n\nI am sorry you walked away with an opinion that there isn't an Iraqi worth saving or an Iraqi fighting to restore order and maintain a democratically elected government. I believe there are millions.\n\nBut mostly I really appreciate your response, your insight, and I am sorry for your losses.\n\n&gt; If we go back to Iraq on a large scale, we will hand ISIS the best possible recruiting tool, and when we inevitably eventually leave again, they will still be there.\n\nIf we let them keep their bases in Syria and dig into Iraq and we don't finish the job, they will always be there. I couldn't agree more."

At most, we can maintain some semblance of order while we occupy the place, but our presence can only promote and spread ISIL\'s "bases" in the region, because those bases have no physical existence and ultimately cannot be attacked by an army.\n\nThere is some hope, in the long term. The Kurds are capable of at least holding their own region, the majority Shiite areas will never be fertile ground for ISIS recruiting, and Assad\'s government in Syria is, whatever its faults, a formidable opponent of ISIS. If we grant some support to these groups, eventually ISIS will fade into insignificance.  Their activities depend on support and financing from outside, and there is no guarantee that they will continue to receive this. The longer the conflict continues, the harder it will be for them to dredge up funds. They live on propaganda, and propaganda becomes more and more difficult when there is no apparent progress to speak of, and no Evil Empire around to point to. But the presence of Western militaries in Iraq or Syria would provide them with an enormously powerful propaganda weapon. It isn\'t just that military action wouldn\'t be useful; it would actually make the problem worse. This situation will take years, probably even decades to resolve itself. That\'s true no matter what we do, and we should probably get used to that idea.\n\nI believe there are plenty of Iraqis worth saving, but that doesn\'t mean we can save them. To think we can is to display the same arrogance that got us involved in Iraq in the first place. This world isn\'t a comic book, and we aren\'t Superman. In the long run, they can only save themselves. '

ISIS has legitimate roots but the the momentum was hi-jacked by fundamentalists and removal of them will only accelerate the next "ISIS" and if history is screaming out anything, its\' that the next thing will likely be permanent, have some offensive leverage and create a gravity of power in the middle east that is not in favor of the United States or the western world. To some extent, the current ISIS might be that "thing" considering how successful the group has been and I\'m totally not suprised by the speculation of some to consider the group a state in its\' own right.

About 1000 years ago.\n\nYour point is bullshit. Globally there have been more documented instances of Islamic terrorism and they have the largest body count by far.

aS"no-one is good in this conflict, though I'd say ISIS are certainly the worst of the bunch. While Assad is at the very best secular and a little less brutal than them. The difficulty for the West is that involving themselves on the Syrian side would mean snubbing Saudi Arabia and by extension Sunni muslims as well as snubbing Turkey a NATO member. Furthermore Assad has not helped his cause by (probably) using chemical weapons and torturing and executing thousands of civilians and rebel fighters.\n\nMorally I'd want to pivot towards Iran and a secular Middle-East, realistically this would alienate traditional Western allies in the ME and strengthen Russian influence in Turkey via their likely pivot away from NATO and Syria via Russia's Tartous Port. The harsh truth is that the West needs the energy security of keeping the major ME OPEC exporters on side who are promoting sectarian violence as a means to counter Shia influence and this means that a lot of the current atrocities and sectarian violence are likely to continue.\n\nIf the West acts we will likely see repercussions in the price or supply of oil that could cripple Western economies/draw us into a war against the KSR and their allies. If we don't act we'll see the continuation to the current genocide and cultural purges that are being enacted across the ME."

aS"Impossible to defeat them without ground troops. Instead of thinking about our vast power think about the vast expanse of land and that it takes a human being to decide what, where, when and how a target is struck. Consider that ISIS is nothing more than a group of people who know each other and that people running around cannot be tracked from satellites or other things the movies might make us believe. Basically even if we had hundreds of aircraft over Iraq flying continuously they would still not be able to destroy an army only slow down the speed that it moves.\n\nAn enemy like Milosevic where he is fighting for a limited end (possession of Kosovo) but subject to coercion/persuasion by making the costs higher (bombing his troops, bridges, factories, radars) can result in a win for airpower. That is airpower can bring people you want to the negotiating table. Especially if they are a state with a public that can pressure the government. But generally, no, even then airpower doesn't stand much of a chance by itself. Against ISIS its impossible because there is nothing you could do other than kill them faster than they can train new recruits. And if they were failing at that there wouldn't be as many targets to bomb, so success with that is hard to judge. "

aS'You\'re peddling in semantics here.  "The West" is not some cohesive, monolithic entity with a unified policy towards the region.  Certain actors pursued, and continue to pursue, divergent goals...all of whom fall under the lazy label of "the West".\n\nTurkey and a number of Gulf States fear the "Shiite Crescent".  They have little to fear from an aggressive Sunni jihadist insurgency, ostensibly because they\'re Sunni majority themselves.  They have no problem giving every jihadist and his brother an AK.  The US and Europe don\'t like Assad, but don\'t have a particularly pressing need to see him removed.  If the US wanted Assad gone, a couple of tomahawks on his C&amp;C structure would have likely tipped the balance.  They want to support secular rebels, because Assad has proven himself to be a callous tyrant, but not enough secular rebels exist to form a cohesive fighting force.  The result is a mealy-mouthed policy of disgust for Assad\'s actions, and very little actual action beyond training a few thousand fighters.\n\nIsrael probably just wants to see them all kill each other.\n\nBut there was never any strategic imperative to expend resources to halt the coalescence of ISIS.  If your enemy has cancer, why waste your energy trying to cure him?  The calculus changed when ISIS declared itself to be a caliphate and have international aspirations.  At that point, American bombs started falling on ISIS.  Up until that point, though, there was no imperative to involve American forces in yet-another Middle Eastern conflict.  Neglecting to tackle the issue in the early stages does not assign blame for murderous rampage of ISIS.'

They would also have to get through Iran....that isn't going to be easy, and Iran doesn't really want Arabs setting up shop on their other border when they already have them very close on their western border.  Persians aren't going to let Arabs walk into their countries and tell them what to do.  And sure, there might be a few isolated incidents that get attributed to 'isis', but it won't be a real thing that takes hold.

No. It\'s the Syrian rebels, and the Kurds. They\'re both fighting a group that has become so powerful due to Iraqi military incompetence. Assad isn\'t doing anything to stop it, simply because ISIS is literally weakening nearly all players in the country. \n\nSecond of all, wishing for an Islamic State is different for wishing for a group like ISIS taking over their own country, and fucking razing their own cultural and national identity. Having a government that has religion playing a role in it is the only thing that has worked in the Middle East, nothing else has. Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and GCC nations all have religion playing it\'s role in society. A government should represent the people, and not force people into believing in things that they don\'t actually believe in. My point is, if the people want a particular form of government, then there is no harm in using this form of government instead of what a westerner would want in place for his government. Besides, no one wants the "civilized world" (heh, claiming that Syrians and Middle Easterners are not civilized, although Syria is considered the cradle of fucking civilization) to interfere in politics, Iran and Russia supporting the government, and GCC, U.S. and Turkey supporting the rebels is one of the reasons why this civil-war has lasted for over 5 years.'

Such a scenario is of course currently nigh impossible, but if ISIS were to take Baghdad and advance further south, I could imagine the Iraqi government becoming willing to take drastic measures.\n\nAt the moment though the status quo is simply not threatening enough for the big actors to take drastic action.

Iran *won't* be; the US wouldn't allow that. So Iran's future in Iraq is reliant on continued upheaval.  As Iraq stabilizes the US's influence will grow and Iran's will decrease proportionately, since the US obviously  would want Iran to butt out. However, at Iraq's lowest point of stability Iran's influence will be at its greatest."

They operate as a unit; even if they have differences and squabbles, they all share the name Saud and Saudi blood.\n \nThey have absolutely no reason to fear ISIS. ISIS is doing SA\'s dirty work for them. By keeping the region in chaos, that ensures no other country could challenge SA\'s economic, political and military (without including Israel) dominance in region. Iran is the only non-US ally that could possibly challenge them, and look what\'s happening. Yemen has become the battleground for a proxy war between the two.\n \nAs far as your comparisant between the US and SA funding terrorism... the US has "lost" $8.8B in cash in the ME, "lost" large amounts of high-tech military hardware, weapon systems, munitions, and armored vehicles in the ME, US-made weapons are finding their way in to the hands of ISIS. I just saw an article saying that ISIS is posting ads in Lebanon looking for people to fix and maintain US military equipment. If that\'s not enough of a sign... then I don\'t know.\n \nIt\'s an open secret that SA, Qatar, and Turkey are funding/helping ISIS, the Taliban and Al Queda. It\'s old news that the US is indirectly arming and funding terrorists, including ISIS. No one has gone to jail or been questioned. No charges have been filed. No changes have been made in the US handling of military equipment and funds despite losing billions of dollars worth of shit that goes boom.\n \nIn everyday life, the obvious answer is usually the right answer. In politics, the obvious answer is never the right one.'

aS'a) American weapon transfers to rebels in Syria were extremely small, and, realistically, have contributed virtually nothing to ISIS. ISIS funds itself, captured (and outright purchased) plenty of weapons from the Iraqi army, and got weapon donations from large regional players. The region is currently flush with small arms.\n\nThis is a different situation; obviously, a lot of American weapon aid to the Iraqi army does wind up in ISIS\'s hands, including stuff that we really don\'t want there. But Iraq wanted the American army out, so there\'s not much America can do but bombing campaigns and risk-managed weapons transfers (for example, sending AT-4\'s instead of Javelins).\n\nb) I think you misunderstand what fuels involvement in ISIS. Especially for local members, there are multiple reasons for joining with ISIS, from tribal conflicts, to sectarian conflicts, to religious motivations, to a sociopathic drive for meaning and glory. No matter how we look at it, however, bombing them, even with serious collateral, will not dramatically strengthen their recruitment drives because they *are not fighting America.* They are fighting a war of territorial expansion to establish a caliphate that controls the Levant - that\'s why they are called the Islamic State of *Iraq and the Levant* - or they are fighting to secure themselves from Shia oppression, or they are fighting to gain territory/hold territory against neighboring tribes, or they are fighting because they are psychos - I mean that literally, not just to denigrate them.\n\nThe "bombing creates more rebels" theory has a certain, if incomplete, appeal to describe Al-Qeada, particularly in Yemen (among other places), but not to the American-led bombing campaign against ISIS in Iraq. If there is US activity that breeds support for ISIS, it is, paradoxically, American support for the largely Shia Iraqi army, because they have committed some of the actual attacks on Sunnis that have made joining ISIS appealing.\n\nNow, this article notes that the religious motivations of many ISIS members includes an opposition to modernity that is easily represented by America and other developed democratic societies, but bombing people does not make them religiously opposed to modernity; it may make them opposed to the American-led bombing campaign (including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc.), but, again, ISIS is not fighting America.\n\nI hope that you change your mind about your comment.'

It's strategy. The only confusion to me is...why announce it? That seems dumb/another strategy I don't understand.\n\nEdit: I'll add also that IMO ISIS has no intention of using said nuclear weapon. They are seeking to establish a caliphate and rid it of people that they don't like (infidels), not put their own kind in danger. They may be unrelenting and intolerant, but they are people and they aren't stupid. Threats to France, Italy and the US are about as hyperbolic as N. Korea, considering ISIS has no sufficient ground capabilities to go up against a full-fledged modern army. They may look strong, but consider who they are fighting. \n\nEdit 2: Thinking about it, announcing the capability for nuclear possession could be a way to lure the US into another Iraq situation, furthering our lessening influence and poor reputation around the world. Sadly, this could work. "

Even this guy, who was a rich US-educated non-religious guy said that if they were having success against Isreal he "couldn\'t help it" that he would be "rooting for them in his heart"\n\nIf they start carrying out operations inside Isreal their will be a MASSIVE popular groundswell of support for them across the Arab world.  They\'ll get another 100,000 fighters.  \n\nAnd at that point Isreal will probably realize just how bad they\'ve played their hand and will be begging HAMAS for help.'

aS'There are likely people in the US military command that are biting at the bit for something like this to happen. The US has not fought a "real war" against a "real enemy" in a very long time, and the current situation developing with IS(IS/IL) is exactly what the doctor ordered for a lot of people who are/were disillusioned with the last crusade in the middle east.\n\n* ISIS now controls the *majority* of Syrian territory, as well as roughly 35 or 40% of Iraqi territory -  for all intents and purposes, they have an entire nation. People are more willing to support a war against an entity with distinct geographical boundaries than one without.\n\n* Beyond a concrete operating area, they also have an *army*. Not just men in rags hiding in caves, but a real-live, payed army. People are more willing to support a war against an army than a bunch of guys in black pajamas.\n\n* They are not only extremists, they\'re *very active* extremists, and do truly deplorable things. Like the previous two points, people are more willing to support a war if the enemy is not morally ambiguous in their goals. By many accounts, IS(IS/IL) can be considered an evil entity (akin to how the Nazis were publicly viewed in WW2).\n\n* They have things that other people (e.g. us) want. Beyond just their oil (which they have a lot of), they have modern military equipment - much of which is still in very usable condition for overseas operations, which could stand to be reclaimed. They also have *money*. A very, very large pool of ill-gotten money, which stands to go to the victor of any such conflict. It also turns out that the US could always use more money.\n\nA formal military conflict with IS(IS/IL) is probably one of the best things the US can do right now for both foreign policy as well as reinvigorating American confidence in the government.'

At that point, I\'ll readily admit that ISIS is more dangerous than bathtubs.\n\nBut is still nowhere near as big a threat to our existence as stairs. \n\nSeriously, ISIS and terrorism in general is the boogeyman being used to scare us.

President friggin' Sanders himself is going to open that nuclear football and punch up those codes, there's no question about it. \n\nWe have to assume that in your hypothetical scenario, ISIS has managed to carve out their caliphate and has a de facto state encompassing much of Iraq and Syria; any city they control is going to be wiped off the face of the earth. Look what we did after 9/11 - we didn't even know who did it, we went and started multiple wars and hundreds of thousands of people died. America will have zero qualms about nuking a million people who they see as their violent and hated enemies. Sadly, no one is losing sleep over thousands of dead Iraqi's today and no one will lose any over a full nuclear retaliation in the middle east. The pro war crowd will be waving American flags in the streets as Minutemen ICBMs streak overhead. "

We hit them. They are in deep shit. We are in deep shit. *Everyone else is doing just fine*. USA is no longer the world's most powerful country, that is all.

They're many times stronger than Bin Laden ever was, really. And remember what that twit was able to do?\n\nI'm not even american. Everybody pretty much everywhere can recognize the threat (especially those in the Middle-East). They're an absolutely critical problem right now."

p1354
aS'I understand that that is what the conjecture is right now. But did you really make any points that aren\'t hammered through in 3 minute talking point interviews on a daily basis in the mainstream media? "ISIS is a huge threat!" "They have huge financing!" "They\'re ambitious!" "They\'re stronger than Bin Laden!" "They\'re a critical problem!"\n\nYour over simplified argument could be turned right back around on the united states for propaganda use in the opposite viewpoint. "America is a huge threat. They have a huge population and a huge military, and endless financing. They have relations with other states, and are effective on the battlefield. They\'re invading Iraq on baseless accusations. They\'ve killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, and are stealing our natural resources. They installing puppet dictators which cater to their economic and geo-political agendas."\n\nIts a legitimate statement, but provides no context and is oversimplified. And that\'s all we get from the mainstream media regarding the threat of ISIS. And yet, ISIS provides such utility for the United States. They were our gateway into Syria, they provided the UK and Canada the public fear they needed to pass far-reaching \'anti-terror\' legislation, they allow our continued interventions in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. My basic question is, what does ISIS gain by making these threats against the west? They want to establish a caliphate state in the middle east, how does broadcasted beheadings of 2 Americans and the burning of a Jordanian, the claiming of attacks in the US (Texas art contest), and endless threats, even with nuclear weapons, against the west, help further that cause? These things only benefit the players who benefit from these endless wars in the middle east. I think our support of Saudi Arabia, our support of Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war, our 2003 invasion of Iraq, our overthrow of Gaddafi, all show without doubt that our intentions in the middle east are in no way to spread democracy and support peace.\n\nAnd an additional point I want to make about the use of American propaganda. Think about the accusations we made against Saddam in terms of massacring his own people, suppressing uprisings, and his brutal dictatorship. Well... what are we doing right now? Saddam may have suppressed the Kurds and Shia\'s in northern Iraq, but now we (through the current Iraqi Ayatollah and other proxies) are massacring and suppressing the Sunni uprising which is ISIS, many of which are residents of Iraq (many are former dispersed Iraqi National Guard). So we run the same dictatorship that Saddam did, just in a different perspective. Not to mention, per Paul Bremer\'s orders of the new constitution of Iraq, the Ba\'athist\'s are banned in the state, hows that for democracy? Conditions are no better in Iraq, and by most standards they\'re significantly worse. We\'ve just reversed the roles. \n\nYou might say, hey, ISIS is terrible, and does terrible things. That may be true, but what do you think the Sunni and Ba\'athist setiment against the Shia\'s and Kurds were under Saddam? I think the best quote to put this in perspective is **"There is no objective definition of terrorism, only different perceptions of violence."**'

aS'Despite your claims, ISIS provides Quran quotes on how to treat your slave girls, and sells them in the market. They destroy historical antiquities, following the example of the Prophet himself, who destroyed the traditional images in kabaa. As for wearing of hijab, " they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, their husbands sons, their brothers or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments." So yes, there are clothing rules, and even there, the quran mentions slaves, with no sense of  embarrassment, not the slightest rejection of the institution of slavery. It openly advocates for the sort of isolation of the sexes practiced by Saudi Arabia. \nSo, to answer your question, no. it would not be heaven on earth. It would be a slave owning highly structured society, that destroys its own history and institutionalizes some of the worst that humanity has done. '

So it was a bunch of enlisted privates.  \n\nYou have to remember those guys don't have the patriotism engraved into from birth like we do.  They've been screwed over by a dictatorship for so long that all they care about is protecting their own families.\n\nIf a US unit of all enlisted men had all the officers flee/die on them, I can beat you good money that at least one private would step up and take command.  It actually happened a lot in WW2 where the officers would be snipped or killed early on in a battle.  (It's why officers started covering their helmets in mud to hide the insignia).  When a Japanese unit had its officer killed the unit would surrender.  When a US unit had its officer killed the unit kept fighting.  \n\nEven though you'll hear most of us Americans bitch and moan about our government.  Push comes to shove we'll kill and die for this country in droves.  We know how great our government is and how much better our economy is than the rest of the world, even if we hate the leadership.   \n\nYou'll see a guy in Arkansas gladly put his life on the line to protect a guy from San Francisco, and vice versa, in the US army.  You will NOT see that in most countries, especially Iraq. "

aS"You are confused. If Zionism is:\n\n&gt; a movement for the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel.\n\nThen anti-Zionism is by definition the opposition to that movement. Since Israel currently exists, then what that means, is that anti-Zionists want to destroy that nation. A person who is an anti-Zionist cannot be loyal to the state of Israel. He can be loyal to a different state, like Palestine, but not to Israel, since he is opposed to it's very existence.\n\nSure, someone who isn't a Zionist is not necessarily disloyal to Israel, but someone who is anti-Zionist is, by the very definition of the word.\n\nIn your example of Egypt, would you say ISIS operatives in Egypt are loyal to Egypt? Obviously not. ISIS wants to destroy Egypt, and unite the middle east into a Muslim Caliphate.\n\nSame thing with those who describe themselves as anti-Zionists, just on a smaller scale. They want to destroy Israel, and unite it with Palestine.\n\nAgain, by the very definition of the term, you cannot be loyal to Israel while being anti-Zionist. It is literally impossible. It's equivalent to claiming ISIS are loyal to Iraq or Syria.\n\nAnd how about you answer my question already?\n\n&gt; Do you genuinely think [Azmi Bishara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azmi_Bishara), the founder and ex-leader of one of the main Arab parties, is loyal to Israel?\n\nAlso, I've proven to you that Zoabi refuses to pledge loyalty to Israel.\n\nI'll ask another question now, since again you refused to address it in your previous reply:\n\n&gt; Do you think a US representative who meets up with and supports Al-Qaeda, can be considered loyal to the US?\n\nUnless you answer those questions, I don't see a point in continuing this discussion."

aS"Yes, the basic talking points fed by the west. ISIS has losses of over 20,000 military. Iraqi security forces have losses of about 9,000. \n\nHow many civilians did the United States kill in Iraq? (over 200,000 by conservative estimates) How many were displaced? How many tortured? Your remarks AREN'T IN ANY CONTEXT. You're saying ISIS is bad by definition, and the west is good by definition, so we demonize their autrocities, while we commit the same acts of violence, and give our ourselves a free pass. Yes, terrible things are happening because of ISIS, terrible things have happened because of United States interventions.\n\nMy question is, how are we still continuing the spiral of more and more war and conflict, and who are the players in the background making enormous profits off of these conflicts. \n\nI would support what you're saying if western interventions to these conflicts were actual solutions, but they're not, and we just end up doing the same horrific things as our enemies, and creating many, many more of them. We destroy infrastructure, displace large groups of people, create even more poverty than before, then brand any uprisings on terrorism. We use these new enemies to build up popular support for more war, and the spiral of insanity continues, and its clearly working again, as many people believe ISIS is a new threat that must be dealt with by western intervention.\n\nAgain, my point is, that the West is not rattling off 24/7 about the threat of ISIS because they're a realistic threat to the United States or the UK, but because it is used as a pretext to continued intervention. How can we sanction Iran, fight ISIS, sanction Syria, work with Assad, fight Iran by proxy in Yemen while working with Iran to fight ISIS, fight Hezbollah by proxy while Hezbollah fights ISIS, support the Sunni's in Saudi Arabia while supporting the Shia's in the Iraqi Security forces, and then somehow sell that ISIS IS A THREAT TO THE WORLD.

There are multiple strains of strict religious interpretation that lead to anti-Zionism among extremely religious Jews.\n\nLets make it very simple for you:\nIsrael is a state.\nZionism is a political movement.\nZionism was critical in the formation of Israel as a State.\nThe complete disappearance of Zionism from the face of the Earth would not make one jot of difference in the further existence of Israel as a state.\n\nAnti-Zionists can be perfectly loyal to Israel.  They just happen to have a different concept of how the state should be run, which is perfectly fine in a democracy.  In fact, diversity of opinion should be encouraged.\n\nAnti-Zionists may not be loyal to certain political parties that have made Zionism central to their self-identity, like Likud, but they can be perfectly loyal to the state of Israel.\n\n&gt; ISIS operatives\n\nThere's your logic flaw.  Operatives take action, and Isis is an organization, not a belief system.  Simply having a desire that your state have a different system of governance is not disloyal.

aS'...what?\n\n\n...***What?***\n\n\n\nNowhere in that incoherent rambling does a single coherent point emerge.  Cherrypicking a few lines here and there, spouting nonsense clearly inspired by the propaganda you\'ve heard, but not nearly intelligent enough to succeed as such, ignoring the actual reality of the situation that I had just explained...this is nonsense.  Here are the facts, once again.  Read over them carefully and see if you can understand.\n\n\nThe United States wants foreign governments that they can control to some degree, either by exerting direct control on the leadership or having similar goals on a geopolitical level.  This usually ends up as supporting dictatorships, since it\'s easier to control a single dictator than an entire voting populace.  \n\n\nMost countries in the middle east are majority Muslim.  Therefore, a democratically elected government will generally be based on Muslim principles, just like the majority Christian USA has a government based heavily on Christianity.  \n\n\nTo exert control over Muslim majority countries, it is helpful to spread propaganda promoting hate and Islamophobia.  "Terrorist" and "islamist" are buzzwords frequently found in this propaganda that are essentially meaningless--the propagandists have succeeded in convincing people they are bad things, and thus when thrown at an \'enemy\' gullible people such as yourself start to hate just like you\'re told to do.  \n\n\nFurther, the military-industrial complex that exerts tremendous power over the American government needs a constant state of war in order to survive, and thus a constant enemy.  Communism filled that role for a long time, but ever since the Soviet Union dissolved there has been a void.  A boogeyman is necessary, so the war on Islam began.  \n\n\n\nThe racism and Islamophobia of this campaign is due to several factors, many of which are part of the propaganda you receive.  First, there is the obvious fact that the United States consistently refuses to recognize a Muslim-led democracy, instead branding the winning parties terrorists, such as the Muslim Brotherhood.  The secular dictatorship of Sisi was considered better because it allowed western powers to continue to control Egypt and it was consistent with the war on Islam.  Calling a group "terrorists" because you disagree with them and they are Muslims is a common tactic, really.  Look at Hezbollah; the US calls them a terrorist organization despite the fact that they are basically the de facto Lebanese army and only defend the country against invasion, not only that but they are *right now* defending the Lebanese people against ISIS.  \n\n\nBut the western media doesn\'t acknowledge these groups for what they are.  They\'d rather see ISIS proliferate so they can continue the campaign of hate against Muslims.  They want to convince you that ISIS is somehow representative of Islam despite the fact that these so-called "islamists" and "terrorists" are fighting against them.  \n\n\n\nAnd some people are gullible enough, or just hateful enough, to think that a secular dictator like Sisi or Saddam Hussein or Assad is better than a Muslim-led democracy.  They cheer when Sisi\'s forces imprison and execute political opponents because the media says those people are *Muslims* and of course all Muslims are evil, right?\n\n\n\nTo summarize, they want you to fear Islam and believe it is somehow a cause of violence so that they can install secular dictators who they can then control.  The truth is Islam is no different from any other major religion in its support of or likelihood of inducing violence.  But Islam is most common in the middle east, and so is oil.  Outside powers want that oil, and they need to control the region to do so.  Attempts in the past resulted in decades of turmoil that continues today, attempts in the present revolve around racebaiting and propaganda.  '

aS"Officially, its a crime to be funding ISIS or any terrorist organization in Saudi Arabia. Though, there are some members of the Royal family (the Royal family is huge) and some rich Saudis who are sympathetic to ISIS that do fund them. They do this through charitable fronts that are used to funnel finances to the extremist organizations. The Saudis have been accused for not following the money trail and making the proper arrests and sometimes they turn a blind eye to the issue if its someone with some form of influence.\n\nHowever, at this point, ISIS is pretty self-sufficient. They don't exactly need foreign funding, since most of their money comes from illegal black market oil sales in Turkey and Syria, taxing the people in their territories, looting, extortion, and through ransom money.

aS'"Whose existence is a result of a European genocide"\n\nI think you need to brush up on the history. Zionism within Palestine began in the 1880\'s and saw ever increasing land purchases/Jewish migrants before Hitler ever rose to power. The holocaust was used to help convince Truman after WWII but the wheels had been set in motion long before that with Jewish immigrants expelling Palestinians from the land and their own version of terrorism.\n\n\nI agree ISIS attacking a Western country is a terrible thought. However the establishment of Israel was not some gift because of the holocaust that should be used as a beacon of freedom and human rights.  '

aS"Partially correct, but ISIS didn't just form one day out of a vacuum; there had also to be decades of bad governance in the region together with a very strong and virulent strain of Islamic fundamentalism.

aS"It is definitely difficult to find things from their perspective. Iraq is a fairly large country. It's why airstrikes are ineffective in certain areas.\n\nIf Israel finds out Tel Aviv is targeted by a nuke (or if Tel Aviv is struck) Iraq would be reduced to a wasteland, and they are aware of Israel's nuclear arsenal and the circumstances in which they will use them.\n\nISIS claims many things, many of which are untrue.

aS'I strictly disagree this is the United states fault. This was going to happen one way or another. The ottoman empire  formed this way. It is unnatural in the history of islam for it to be fractured and every time it has been fractured you have exactly what you have now. 1000\'s of years the cycle has been going on to be the ruling head on the kingdom of islam.\n\nIn fact this can be traced back to the fracturing of the middle east after WW1. \n\nA key line from the first link " The Ottoman Empire had been the leading Islamic state in geopolitical, cultural and ideological terms. The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire led to the rise in the "Middle East" of Western powers, such as Britain and France. Resistance to the influence of these powers came from the Turkish national movement and became more widespread in the post-Ottoman states after World War II."\n\nAfter WWII when france and england ceased to be world powers the US stepped in to keep the territories Communist free as it would have seriously boosted the USSR. Its not cut and dry as america is the cause.\n\nCommunism killed more people in russia, china, and north korea than WW2, WW1, and all crusades combined. So tell me who was the bad guy when they took over this job?\n\nAlso ISIS started in syria.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioning_of_the_Ottoman_Empire\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate'

If those rogue Princes, government officials get their desire, which is to see ISIS take over Saudi Arabia, then they\'ve pretty much signed their own death certificates. \n\nJust look at how willy nilly they hand out the death sentence there.

aS"I know we're all a little worried about this, but here are some other points. Whether they mitigate is up to you:\n\n* The amount is relatively low.\n\n* They are not top-notch anti-tank weaponry. The AT-4 was invented in 1983 and fielded in 1987. It is not a serious threat to tanks, and will do exactly what the US proposes it will do: destroy suicide bomb cars and ISIS tacticals, which are, even if you just view combat footage, clearly both demoralizing and effective offensive ISIS tools that they use to overrun Iraqi positions. From the AT-4 wikipedia:\n\n&gt; It is intended to give infantry units a means to destroy or disable armoured vehicles and fortifications, although it is not generally sufficient to defeat a modern main battle tank.\n\n* The weapons are 1-use only, without the possibility to replace the ammunition. Again, from the wikipedia:\n\n&gt; The launcher and projectile are manufactured prepacked and issued as a single unit of ammunition with the launcher discarded after a single use.\n\n* ISIS is fantastic on offense, shittastic on defense. The reason is that the Iraqi army puts up a horrible defense, not that ISIS has strong operation-level skills. Certainly, 1980's infantry anti-tank weaponry will not make ISIS a much greater offensive threat (to add: ISIS already has anti-tank weaponry), and as for ISIS's defense, ISIS has lost virtually every major defensive engagement in the past year. On the other side, AT-4's will definitely help the Iraqi army fix up its defense. So, as weapons transfers go, this seems well thought out. Personally, I find that risk-reward stomachable."
p1415
aS"The United States (according to the latest DoD report - Jan 2015) have killed over 5,000 ISIS members. ISIS have killed 2 US citizens, arguably 3 if you count the Jordanian airstrikes that killed a US prisoner of ISIS.\n\nEven if you consider them extremist, irrational lunatics, I don't think you can make the argument that in any sense of the imagination they think they can 'beat' America. Trust me, I'm no blind-nationalist, I'm just saying that the strategy you speak of doesn't make any sense."
p1416
aS'&gt; you\'ve probably had lots of advantages that the bulk of daesh\'s members have not.\n\nMeaning absolutely no disrespect, I cordially reject your idea that membership in Daesh/ISIS/ISIL --or whatever else you want to call it-- is driven solely or even predominantly by poverty and/or political and social disenfranchisement or lack of privilege.  \n\nWere this the key element behind the formation of such an organization, we would expect to find equally vehement groups gaining strength and even taking power in the many regions of the world where people are even poorer and more disenfranchised than in the Middle-east.  Nor would we expect to see western converts since, after all, if members of ISIS were driven to join purely on the basis of being poor, westerners would not, as you rightly point out, fit the bill.\n\nHowever, none of the above is actually the case.  In point of fact, ISIS attracts young men of all stripes, whether economically disenfranchised or not, and as such is the case, I think that any reasonable analysis has to conclude that once again, ideology is, if not the sole driver, at least a huge component behind what is going on with ISIS.\n\nISIS provides easy answers to everything in a strictly encoded and enforced set of social and religious laws that to the weak-minded must represent something very much like stability, certainty, in what otherwise may often appear to be a very chaotic world.  As a former employee of mine once said --a guy who\'d done 12 years in prison for attempted murder-- "some guys like being in prison. They don\'t have to worry about anything; everything is taken care of, it gives them a sense of security."  \n\nUltimately then, I reject your idea that economic factors are the only or even primary driver behind membership in ISIS.  While economic reality may play a small role, the primary driver is to do with ideology and the notion of having all one\'s questions answered and taken care of by a simplistic doctrine that tells it\'s followers that they are on God\'s side.         \n\n'
p1417
aS'Yes but I must remind you that in this quote:\n\n&gt;A pissed off population managed to give the the largest, most technologically advanced, most practiced, most skilled military in the world some real heart ache;\n\nThe "largest skilled military" was not even using its full strength at all. Most of the attacks on US troops were hit-and-run style attacks and planted ieds by the Iranian/Syrian-backed insurgents and AQ terrorists. It wasn\'t even a "war" with "battles". It was just criminal activities in various cities. It wasn\'t like how ISIS is rolling up and taking over a city.\n\nUS had 3x as many troops in Vietnam and dropped 210 million more bombs on Vietnam than in Iraq.\n\nThe surge worked just fine, and that was barely 180,000 troops. In Vietnam we had 540,000 troops deployed.\n\nAnd when I am talking about Vietnam, don\'t make the assumption that we didn\'t devastate the North Vietnamese army with 1950s-60s technology (or cite the idea that we "lost"... If by "lost" you mean retreated, then sure but that\'s not relevant to how successful the US army was there. A propaganda victory for the North vietnamese is hardly a loss for US forces. The US lost politically not militarily). We have way better technology now. We demolished over 1 million enemy soldiers in Vietnam. We destroyed that country and few people actually realize just how devastating the US forces were.\n\nSo just remember that, while people talk about how "we get bogged down in war" or "can\'t achieve victory in some of our wars." They\'re talking about the reality of (a) when an enemy doesn\'t surrender and make peace. (b) when US Armed forces lose troops in a slow-style bleed. ... In other words, people\'s definition of "loss" for the US is different from the original definition of "loss". It\'s basically "why didn\'t you have total control and complete peace and total surrender of the enemy?" It\'s a higher standard for the US. \n\nA standard where body counts, enemy loss of territory, and enemy loss of property, aren\'t being factored in.\n\n Instead, for enemies of this superpower, the only thing that counts is "willpower", did the enemy surrender? So all the enemy has to do, is not surrender and keep fighting, and eventually the US decides to go away. The terrorists have figured this out already. They learned it from the North Vietnamese. Just don\'t surrender, pretend to fight by making a few hit and runs, eventually the American public will get tired and pull out the troops because they\'re expecting some sort of enemy to announce his surrender.'

aS'I really don\'t understand the motivation behind such an attack other than sensationalism. There is no political or theological gain to be had by this for "ISIS". \n\nWhich leads me to my second conundrum. ISIS appears to be everywhere but nowhere at once. If they are such a threat, why isn\'t somebody bombing the shit out of their military convoy\'s? They seem to have graduated from a guerrilla organization to a full-fledged military power in just a few months.

p1428
aS"&gt;In point of fact, ISIS attracts young men of all stripes, whether economically disenfranchised or not\n\nI actually don't know as much as I'd like about Daesh's demographics, other than that it's predominantly men from the Levant, supplemented with Caucus mercenaries and a small percentage of European/Americans. This is backed up by numbers given by the [CIA/UN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ISIL#Troops_in_Iraq_and_Syria); showing around 15k foreign members, most of which are from Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. I'm making a leap by assuming the people coming from poorer countries are, themselves, poor, but I think that's about as good as estimates get.\n\n&gt;Were this the key element behind the formation of such an organization, we would expect to find equally vehement groups gaining strength and even taking power in the many regions of the world\n\nBut we do. Boko Haram has made the news lately as a Daesh-like force in Africa. Hamas (while older) engages in more traditional terrorism, but maintains a similar set of enemies as Daesh (even though they consider Daesh their enemy) and uses similarly callous tactics, the Uyghurs in northern China / India have been growing in strength, and there are dozens of smaller brigades that arise independently but have recently pledged themselves in service of Daesh. Daesh in the Levant may stand out as a more stunning example because of it's history, but the things that cause it to rise as a force in the first place are not unique.\n\nI agree that religion may be one tool to retain troops and justify brutality - it's always a good way to tempt people into suppressing doubt. But to my mind, it's not the primary factor that leads  to recruitment."

Meanwhile, ISIS has inflicted heavy damage to hezbollah.\n\nTo israelis this is better than the alternatives.  A weaker hezbollah and a weaker ISIS, expending as much available munitions and financial resources to hurt each other, constantly losing trained troops so that they don't build up greater amounts of experienced soldiers.\n\nIsrael cannot change that hezbollah, ISIs, the syrian rebels, and the syrian army all hate Israel.

Yes the society they are defending is broken for the reasons you describe but the issue Carter is describing address the very stark differences in motivation.

It is easy to see how ISIS came to be and how their terroristic actions against their own people (for decades) translates directly into what you see today.  Koran is more or less an excuse for some of their actions.\n\nTo expound upon this even more, his people were so suspicious of each other and their leaders that they were and are demoralized to the point that they just don't care.  That is why the US had so much trouble attempting to stabilize the country and its government.  The people were unable to reform without corruption and were separating and segregating even more than they were before and this led to extreme terrorist groups, half ass police and military which is impossible to correct without a willingness to unite.  Iraq is a less comical North Korea.\n\n*Editing to link to the history of ISIS and how they have actually existed since before 2000 - https://www.corbettreport.com/who-is-isis-an-open-source-investigation/   "

But ISIS weren't that effect while the US military was still in Iraq. IS has only come to power in the vacuum that was created by the US military leaving.

aS'What does Islamic scholarship suggest as the correct way to react to apostasy?\n\nListen: I am not trying to say that there are not beautiful or morally relevant sections of the Qu\'ran.  There are passages that are wonderful, poetic, and true in a sense widely recognized by almost every ideology on the planet.  But there are also sections that imply that the correct way to deal with apostates is to *kill them*.  There are sections that explicitly state that women are worth *much less* than men, and that their proper place is in a subservient and obedient role.  I\'m not saying we should throw the baby out with the bathwater, I\'m saying that the bathwater is gross.  Christianity, being rooted in many of the same traditions as Islam, has gross bathwater too.  The babies are great in both.  And I\'d even argue that the majority of these texts consist of the "baby", and are not problematic with modern ethics.  \n\nBut to suggest that the influence that these holy texts have over their respective religions is inconsequential is, frankly, ridiculous.  We are talking about the most influential books *on the planet*.  I\'m not talking solely of religious texts, I\'m talking about books period.  Name a tome that has carried more cultural weight and influenced more of human society than the Bible or the Qu\'ran or the Vedic texts like the Bhagavad Gita.  \n\nAgain, to clarify (although I think I\'ve been pretty clear) I am not condemning Muslim people simply because they are Muslim.  I know, love and respect many people of the Muslim faith.  The same could be said about Christians, or Hindus, Buddhists, you name it.  My problem is with the texts that inform these people\'s ideology.  And the thing is, most religious people pick and choose sections of texts they tote as "infallible" and "unilaterally true".  In that way they can be simultaneously moral and religious.  Do Christians beat their slaves as the Bible compels them to?  Some might, but only the wackos that the religion as a whole denounces today.  The vast majority do not adhere to this practice because modern society has evolved past this, and Christianity has had to reconcile.  The same is true of Islam, ISIS being the wackos that the rest of the religion denounces.'

I mean the substantive difference to me is that we prosecute cases where it happens and even imprison soldiers that commit these crimes, whereas ISIS uses it as part of a sick strategy to demoralize and ethnically cleanse the region on top of using it as a kind of horrible payment system for its fighters.

aS'What is religionofpeace.com? I\'m making an observation about ISIS\'s treatment of women, which seems extremely similar to the area my family is from (Rajasthan - Northwest India near Pakistan.) This has nothing to do with Islam as a religion. This is also why I mentioned my grandmother. I\'m not trying to imply Islam is a religion that believes women are property.\n\nRegarding your grandmother/sister, what do you mean "if someone did that"? Did what? Burned her for not doing extreme acts? My comment is in direct response to the previous commenter\'s confusion as to the cognitive dissonance between why ISIS extremists banned women from dressing a certain way and why they killed sex slaves for not acting hypersexually. \n\nedit:\n\nI looked into it, and if you want some actual research for the sex slaves thing:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/\n\nThis would indicate that they\'re treating them as property because everyone that isn\'t a part of ISIS is property (men are beheaded, women are kept), and the dress code (so to speak), is a separate requirement (the hijab):\n\nhttp://www.vocativ.com/world/isis-2/isis-launches-womens-dress-code-campaign/\n\nI am personally making the leap to say that for women, they are connected for members of ISIS. This is a quote from Reza Azlan from the wikipedia on the Hijab:\n\nThe veil was neither compulsory nor widely adopted until generations after Muhammads death, when a large body of male scriptural and legal scholars began using their religious and political authority to regain the dominance they had lost in society as a result of the Prophets egalitarian reforms.\n\nIf you disagree, that\'s fine, since the connection is my opinion.'

Do you think that is reasonable?\n\nIn today's world, a helicopter crashes or 5 civilians are mistakenly killed and there is public outcry. Im not saying that is wrong.... But war is war. If we want ISIS disposed of, and quickly, Americans have to realize that. \n\nUnfortunately we have been dragged through almost 15 years of continuous conflict and don't want to commit any more resources to a major offensive. Especially considering that in the long run, all the previous troop surges in Iraq clearly did not work out. \n\nThe alternative is tactical strikes on ISIS command with help from local ground troops. The problem here is that the Iraqi army is not motivated to fight and when we cut off the head of ISIS, another grows back. \n\nPersonally, I think we only have two options: 1) go in with an over whelming ground force and fuck anything that moves with a weapon or 2) stay the fuck out and let countries in the area (Iran and Saudi) figure it out. \n\nBut that's just like my opinion man.

Iran would never accept Sunni control of Iraq / Syria, and saudi / turkey would never accept shi\'a influence. The United States is aware that their bff Saudi Arabia is the ideological bedrock of ISIS, but cant outright call saudi on it, as the royals are dependent on clerical support to maintain authority over the country. The U.S. and Iran have bad history, but the US is beginning to see Iran as an important ally against ISIS - but an Iranian victory, although it would crush ISIS, would empower the "just as evil" Assad and be cataclysmic for the Sunnis of Iraq and eastern Syria. \n\nIt\'s pretty much the same thing that happened in Afghanistan - with 5-6 regional / international players all supporting different groups as they tore the country apart. Everyone wants "peace" but everyone wants peace on their own, incompatible terms.\n\nUntil the regional actors actually consider the welfare and stability of those conflicted areas over their own strategic needs, it is unlikely this will go in any direction that isn\'t a downward spiral.'

If you\'re against slavery, I suggest you refrain from slavery promotion and condemn it unconditionally.\n\n&gt;If Muslims followed Islam there would be no slavery because of all the rules and incentive to free slaves. \n\nThere are examples of Mohammed being against freeing slaves, for enslaving, for trading slaves, being for the rape of slaves (according to my own morality, which I won\'t apologize for via some misplaced notion of moral relativism). According to these examples, ISIS would have cause to disagree with you and instead keep on enslaving and raping.\n\n&gt;look at the social status of the Mamluks as an example.\n\nLook at the social status of castrated African slaves as an example; the men, women and children having their life destroyed, torn apart and forced into lifelong slavery, all because Mohammad couldn\'t say these three words: "Slavery is wrong". Historical acts of Muslim slavers shouldn\'t be cause for Islamic apologism... no more than the Ottoman practice of impalement, for example. ISIS isn\'t arguing for Islam on the basis of something like Mamluk slaves or the Ottoman empire, but on the basis of the original Islam as they read it.\n\n&gt;I referenced scriptures and backed my statement with historical and factual data, what do you want ?\n\nI want you to explain why you\'re apologizing for slavery. Is it because Islam is so stigmatized in the worldthe religion of the around 2 billion Muslims and risingthat you need to give them a hand?

aS"In Islam, there is such a thing as taking war captives and female slaves if the proper conditions are met. I'm not here to pretend that Islam is a completely pacifist religion like Hinduism or something like that. No, there is legislated warfare in Islam.\n\nHowever, the call of ISIS is different than the call of Muhammad, peace be upon him. Muhammad, peace be upon him, called to singling out Allah in worship, and due to oppression and breaking of peace treaties, they went to war with the pagans. \n\nISIS, on the other hand, is coming out of nowhere, calling to establishing the khaleefah at all costs. This is not the call of the prophets. ISIS is calling to the khaleefah and only mention monotheism when it is politically convenient for them and as a smoke screen to hide their true intentions.\n\nhttp://www.islamagainstextremism.com"

aS'&gt; It is true that apologizing for slavery in an Islamic context doesn\'t mean you are for slavery yourself. I apologize for that, but I won\'t apologize for considering your words slavery apologism. If you\'re against slavery, I suggest you refrain from slavery promotion and condemn it unconditionally.\n\nThat\'s okay friend, I just wish to have a constructive discussion. I don\'t consider myself an apologist, I\'m merely fighting misconceptions of what is slavery in Islam (most people think of the transatlantic slave trade). \n\n&gt;There are examples of Mohammed being against freeing slaves, for enslaving, for trading slaves, being for the rape of slaves (according to my own morality, which I won\'t apologize for via some misplaced notion of moral relativism). According to these examples, ISIS would have cause to disagree with you and instead keep on enslaving and raping.\n\nCan you give me examples, be sure to research your subject before posting discrepancies or disputed historical allegations. I find it surprising considering that the teachings of Islam regarding slaves are quite the opposite, why didn\'t Islam follow the bible or the torah ?\n\n&gt;Look at the social status of castrated African slaves as an example; the men, women and children having their life destroyed, torn apart and forced into lifelong slavery, all because Mohammad couldn\'t say these three words: "Slavery is wrong". Historical acts of Muslim slavers shouldn\'t be cause for Islamic apologism... no more than the Ottoman practice of impalement, for example. ISIS isn\'t arguing for Islam on the basis of something like Mamluk slaves or the Ottoman empire, but on the basis of the original Islam as they read it.\n\nBut Muhammad clearly said that tormenting slaves is forbidden, you shouldn\'t blame theology because some Muslims didn\'t follow his teachings. Judging the stupid actions of some Muslims is fine, but my point is that they cannot be justified by the scriptures. \n\n&gt;I want you to explain why you\'re apologizing for slavery. Is it because Islam is so stigmatized in the worldthe religion of the around 2 billion Muslims and risingthat you need to give them a hand? I want you to explain things like Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 459; Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 41, Number 598; Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3432; Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 47, Number 765... and what its implications are via the Sunnah. Why ISIS is any less justified in their acts and religious rationale than some moderate Muslim with their own version, especially according to the referenced sacred texts.\n\nFirst of all you have to read the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim, today hadiths are more important than the Qu\'ran in the Islamic corpus (hadiths and notes from scholars are used for tafsir and interpretations of the Qu\'ran) but many of them are false and contradicts the Qu\'ran itself. DAESH strong point isn\'t theology, they get destroyed by scholars on a daily basis, I don\'t care about their interpretation of x hadiths if it\'s contradicting the Qu\'ran, the Qu\'ran is pretty clear when people need to be punished : \n\n&gt;The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes, and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of Allah , if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.\n\nDon\'t you see the problem ? The Qu\'ran doesn\'t need interpretations, interpretations happened after when the Islamic corpus was formed and for political reasons, why should we allow interpretations ? The answer is "because some scholars centuries after the death of the Prophet said so based on reports who contradicts the Qu\'ran and some of them have poor chain transmission or contradicts other hadiths in the same collection", is this logical to you ?\n\n&gt;My anti-slavery agenda? Undoubtedly so. It\'s very convenient to defend Islam by defending the type of slavery it promotes. It\'s wrong to anybody but the fundamentalist Muslims, but if you want to defend slavery, go ahead. \n\nAs I said, stop with the petty comment and insults. The "fundamentalism" you\'re talking about is not fundamentalism it\'s simply cherry picking, today jihadists rely on scholars and reports, fundamentalism in Islam is the Qu\'ran.\n\n&gt;I\'m waiting for DAESH to torture people to death, just like Mohammed (Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 261...). They are already killing people whom they deem apostates, or who actually are apostates (Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 260), just like Mohammed commands.\n\nThanks for proving my point by using hadiths who contradicts the Qu\'ran, you should really read about the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim there is a great book in Arabic by Gamal al-Banna and in english you have "Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet\'s Legacy".'

If not, then we are still at war with the non-believers. So, why don\'t you kill them all? Why did you call ISIS is evil for following the teaching? Why are you denying the word of Allah?\n\nAnd what are you doing on reddit? Gathering in a place full of the non believers. Talking with them as they are your friend.

Why?\n\n&gt;al-Mutawakkil endorsed a more literal interpretation of the Qur\'an and Hadith.[11] The caliph was not interested in science and moved away from rationalism, seeing the spread of Greek philosophy as anti-Islamic.[11]\n\nSo, almost literally, what ISIS claims to be fighting against now is what started their decline in 850.  That is 400 years before the sack of Baghdad.  The reason Baghdad became so "powerful" in the intellectual traditions was a result of geography.  You had the great Persian intellectual traditions of the East alongside contact with China and India.  You had the great Roman and Greek intellectual traditions in the West.  Islam is as much responsible for greatly diminishing these two as anyone.\n\nBy the time of the sack, Egypt had split off, Turkey had split off, Persia had split off, parts of Palestine and Syria had been lost, North Africa and Spain were far away, and Arabia itself had already descended back into tribalism.'

aS'&gt;(most people think of the transatlantic slave trade)\n\nChristian slavery apologists sound just like Islamic slavery apologists. One might as well say that most people think of the Muslim-operated trans-Saharan slave trade when they hear Islamic slavery, if most knew it had existed. Slavery is slavery to me. Mohammad failed in ending or simply condemning it in principle, and the results have echoed through the centuries, in the despair of slaves specifically. Today it\'s Yezidis, hundreds of years ago it was Africans, Europeans, Caucasians etc. Rationalize or fantasize about the great Mamluks all you want, I wouldn\'t dare to fantasize anything positive about an abhorrently immoral practice such as slavery. I don\'t care what most people think, I care about what slavery is, and slavery is slavery. Apologia of slavery is what it is, Islamic, Christian or secular. Today nobody apologizes for people who watched heretics burn in Europe hundreds of years ago, nor do they apologize for the "kind" Western slave owners... but Islamic slavery apologetics abound, apparently. All because the Quran encourages slavery, and because of the bizarre moral relativism Muslim religionists hypocritically employ when they, conveniently, aren\'t arguing for the divine objective morality that\'s supposedly in the Quran.\n\n&gt;Can you give me examples, be sure to research your subject before posting discrepancies or disputed historical allegations.\n\nThe historical allegations belong to the Hadith, which I did not compose nor do I condone as having any historical or "divine" value. What history Islam, and Mohammed especially, has without the Hadith, I do not know. If the Hadith needs to be interpreted in some contrived way, in my eyes that only serves to condemn Islam even more, for such a religion is obviously full of ways to exploit humanity. Other than pointing out slavery as being explicitly condoned in the Quran, even without the Hadith, of course all the minutia of slavery practices is up for grabs by the Islamic sects. Criticize me for not aiming to become an Islamic scholar here and now, but do you have any criticism of the specific Hadith I posted, which ISIS follows in their quest to be the most Islamic? ISIS is who you have to fight, via authoritative interpretations or otherwise, not me. Islam "in general" has already lost me.\n\n&gt;But Muhammad clearly said that tormenting slaves is forbidden, you shouldn\'t blame theology because some Muslims didn\'t follow his teachings. \n\nMohammad clearly says many things, depending on what you consider authoritative. Point out which Hadith are unacceptable to you, otherwise Mohammad can be shown as being very much for mistreating all humans, within the conditions of his version of divine morality, of course. Aside from the pathologically pacifist religious figures in some other religions, religions tend to take the right to impose harm on humanity in the name of divine guidance. I don\'t believe you that Mohammad is against mistreating anybody, as long as it served his purposes as prophet of God while still alive.\n\n&gt;Don\'t you see the problem ? The Qu\'ran doesn\'t need interpretations, interpretations happened after when the Islamic corpus was formed and for political reasons, why should we allow interpretations ?\n\nTell that to Muslims, and believers of other religions with respect to their own sacred texts. I\'m not here to defend ISIS\'s interpretation of Islam, we don\'t need that, I\'m here to condemn religious dogma as a guide to behaviour. \n\n&gt;...contradicts the Qu\'ran and some of them have poor chain transmission or contradicts other hadiths in the same collection", is this logical to you ?\n\nThe Quran itself isn\'t logical to me, much less the people who\'ve circled and interpreted it with whichever extra text for the last 1400 years. I\'ve even heard condemning criticism of all the Hadith, not just "some". I trust myself to be objective enough to go against any ancient Islamic scholar, whom you think had the right idea about Islam, and show him to be immoral according to what most of us, at least in the West today, consider morality.\n\n&gt;As I said, stop with the petty comment and insults. The "fundamentalism" you\'re talking about is not fundamentalism it\'s simply cherry picking, today jihadists rely on scholars and reports, fundamentalism in Islam is the Qu\'ran.\n\nYou take the right to be insulted by what I said; feel free, I think it\'s a good thing. I want the right to be insulted as well, since the only way to correct certainty in falsehood is through a process which tends to feel insulting or degrading. And I do indeed take insult at your slavery apologism, and I take insult to Islam and the Quran. It\'s a horrible religion. I am certain enough that slavery, no matter how "Islamically proper" via the "holy Quran", is immoral; with the Hadith or no. Criticize people for cherry picking, I\'ve no reason to believe you\'re not doing the same with your own interpretation of Islam.\n\n&gt;you should really read about the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim there is a great book in Arabic by Gamal al-Banna and in english you have "Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet\'s Legacy".\n\nI may look it up. Nonetheless, I will also reiterate my point: I\'m not in danger of raping people because Mohammad didn\'t say slavery is wrong. Some, some Muslims seem to be. That is not my fault. It\'s not my burden. Even if it was, a kafir such as myself wouldn\'t be accepted by the 2 billion Muslims as an authority on proper Hadith interpretation. Nothing about what Gamal al-Banna says will fix my view of Mohammed or Islam. Not because I\'m not willing to learn, it\'s because the Quran condemns itself enough, and surely some authentic Hadith (according to you and Gamal, if you two are the authoritative standard) will suffer the same condemnation. Muslims say "To you your religion and to me mine.", my religion is to despise religions like Islam, and individuals like Mohammad.'

The Sunnis and Shias more than likely would fail to come to terms.  ISIS happened because the Syrian war gave them the power in east Syria and Iraqi division allowed them to pull from the Sunni anger.\n\nEven if we beat ISIS it'll only be a matter of time before another offshoot pops up.  I simply don't see a democracy in Iraq satisfying both the groups.  One of them's going to get shafted and then Saudi Arabia and Iran will capitalize to fight the other through Iraqi proxy.  Even right now people are cheering that Iran's backing up militants against ISIS, but that's just going to end up cementing Sunni anger against Iraqi government since they'll be pulling from Shia militias and Iran.\n\nUSA won't commit to empowering Assad and the rebels are a hotbed for terrorist groups.  Not to mention there'd be very troubling issues if Iraqi government decides they won't welcome Western forces like they refused to do in 2011.  You might remember Obama removing all combat troops, that was because Iraq refused to give them immunity.  If they stayed you'd essentially make it clear to the Iraqi people that unless your government is accepted by the Western standards, we'll simply walk over your sovereignty.  Because if troops started getting arrested or not welcomed in Iraq, would we simply remove their government's power?\n\nFact of the matter is Syria and Iraq are extremely connected.  Democracy simply won't work because it ends up with extremists gaining more power or people getting mad due to getting shafted.  Obama doesn't want to send ground troops because that means even after we beat ISIS, we have to play nation-builder and figure out a way to build a government that both Syrians and American leaders approve of, which simply won't happen because America is hardlined against what the Syrians would want.\n\n \n\n"

aS'You\'re right, I didn\'t. I felt it would have been long winded but here it is imo: the world as it\'s power structures are organized now (UN, NATO etc.) are extremely unipolar, and America is that pole. After WW2 America basically forged a New World Order (no not the lizard people one ;)) in which the idea of sovereign right (meaning war for territory is a huge no-no) were held above all else, this was a reaction to the Soviet annexation of Eastern Europe. This world order was only half of the puzzle until the Soviet collapse however, and right as they fell Saddam tried to invade and annex Kuwait. What Saddam was doing more than just "getting his" was provoking the US and their World Model, because he was demonstrating that even without the Soviets that the US would not respond to an attack on a sovereign nation for their territory. The US did not want there to be another alternative World Model in which rogue nations could ignore UN resolutions or pressure from the West, so they invaded but didn\'t take him out, respecting his sovereign rights but trying to force him to conform to their World Model.\n\nAfter 9/11, the game changed and shortly after Saddam kicked out UN weapons inspectors, proving once again he was a geopolitical black hole and did not answer to the global community, effectively spitting in the face of the power structures the US has been trying to put in place since WW2 and especially post-Soviets. We laugh at it now, but Saddam having WMDs and being internationally unaccountable, and looking to nurture an "axis" World Model where rogue nations can do as they please with their neighbors (and potentially fund terrorism which would erode our power by proxy attrition) was a very real existential threat to the world order built by NATO and the US. He had the ingredients to do it, and there is a chance he sent his weapons to Bashar al-Assad because he is a Russian vassal and the Russians still have an interest in an opposing World Model. They would have a lot to gain from making America\'s excursions in the name of their world order look foolish. Who knows if it happened like that but we do know from Russia\'s annexation of Crimea that they are politically in favor of a different world order, where there are no sovereign rights.\n\nOn ISIS and Assad, I believe Obama is playing a dangerous game trying to wield chaos to achieve geopolitical goals. ISIS is not a sustainable organization, their wrath breeds contempt in  the people around and under them. They will crumble. Assad is far more stable in peace time, and if his regime survives he will continue to generate legitimacy for the Russian World Model, which undercuts American power, so in American interest the Obama administration is trying to turn ISIS back into Syria to take down Assad, because ISIS is making us friends out of foes (Iran is closer now imo than anytime since 1979) and Assad makes foes out of friends due to Syrian regional political and economic power, and also gives the Russians power in the Middle East. We can\'t take out Assad directly either unless he scorns the international community like Saddam because that looks bad when we try to make sovereign rights a staple of our world order. \n\ntl;dr In the middle east, Saddam and Assad (and Iran as well) give power to an alternate world order which is crafted by Russia and is effectively the shadow of Soviet world order. America and its allies have spent blood and money since the collapse in \'91 to undermine the remnants of that order.'

aS'&gt;Because that\'s what ISIS wants....then they become martyrs and the process repeats.\n\nNot exactly. The United States and other countries are following a policy of "minimal damage with maximal effectiveness." However, this effectiveness is limited, partly because the standard for "minimal damage" is pretty high. So the U.S. is not avoiding ISIS because they think "this is exactly what the enemy wants." The U.S. is avoiding ISIS because they don\'t want to destroy the infrastructure of another government to get some gang members taking refuge behind important infrastructure.  \n\nOf course ISIS wants war, but I don\'t think wiping them clean and thus completely humiliating their brand will make them martyrs and encourage growth. I think they are getting more members right now by being apparently "successful," than if one day the New York Times front page showed 5k ISIS bodies scattered across a blown apart bridge. ISIS needs to appear pathetic and weak to the youth they tend to engage. Kids need to go "Man, fuck ISIS. They suck. I\'m just going to continue playing Call of Duty." '

Are you suggesting the western media is willfully keeping what Saudi papers print away from your virgin eyes?\n\n"Bush also vowed to destroy al-Qaeda but then he falsely accused Saddam of supporting al-Qaeda and invaded Iraq."\n\n---The decision to remove Saddam occurred years before Bush was even president. In 1998 President Clinton signed into [law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act) to remove him with 100% Senate support. In fact President Bush publicly stated there was no connection between Saddam and 9/11 even during the thickest fighting during 2006-07. \n\n"Marvelous trick isn\'t it? Create a terrorist group as part of covert aggression against your enemies, when the inevitable blowback occurs, accuse your enemies of working with your creation to justify overt aggression."\n\n---Sigh... The U.S. did not create Al Qaeda or ISIS. If you want we can have a 20 response argument over this but you\'ll find ISIS was created in Jordan in 1999- which was years before Bush was president.

A lot of their longer videos play out like movies. the reason these guys seem so bad is that one, they're pretty bad. About as bad as the other guys.

aS'&gt;can\'t be compared to the transatlantic slave trade ? Do you deny the rights they had ? \n\nI deny the necessity to discuss rights of slaves in the context of religion. Historians have their objectivity, Islamic apologists do not. I deny the rights slaves had "in Islam" because I deny the use of relativism outside of objective, historical academic study and I consider the idea of human rights under slave ownership as self-contradictory; I don\'t care about any other than the most basic human rights. Religions aren\'t history fan clubs, they are ideologies. Religious sects can of course be sympathetic to 21. century morals and we know that the opposite is true as well, not even including things like ISIS. What one apologizes for through a religion, no matter how historical it is, has consequences in the present. Just because moderate believers find ways to rationalize, or remain in cognitive dissonance about their beliefs, doesn\'t mean the potential for abuse is not ever-present. And, again, that potential is not there because people are doing mere history, it\'s because they\'re describing a religion, its nature and commandments; in the case of Islam we have the prophet of God who could do apparently anything he wanted, but did not end slavery or explicitly condemn it. Only 21. century, professional rationalizers of nonsense could find a way to make this sound reasonable or as anything other than what it was, and only people with a pro-Islamic bias, whether Muslims or Islamophiles, self-appointed "Muslim-defenders", would go as far as to muse about "slavery rights" in Islam... especially when Islam\'s doctrinal disregard for basic human rights (or due to its inherent ambiguity, if that\'s your defense) bore fruit in something as horrible as ISIS.\n\nI repeat, "Slavery is always wrong... don\'t ever enslave..." is all that had to be said by Mohammed in the book and ISIS would have nothing to stand on. Some want us to believe that "people would be doing this regardless of Islam" and others should remind them of the changes people and societies go through with the evolution of their beliefs and moral standards. We stopped burning people in the town square, coincidentally when the beliefs and morals changed. Muslim apologists\' tendency to discuss the details of how slavery is excellent and good and morally superior because it was from God\'s prophet (and totally unlike Western slavery), leads to what this whole post is aboutYezidis being enslaved.\n\nChristians have the same problem with rogue African preachers who\'re spreading homophobia and "kill the gays" laws, that didn\'t exist in Africa before the arrival of Islam and Christianity by the way. The movements didn\'t exist before American Christian anti-gay experts left to places more tolerant of their anti-gay ambitions. It would all be unnecessary if homosexuality was simply accepted by the religions, but people would rather discuss details of why homosexuality is theologically wrong and why homophobic sentiment is a good thing. Beliefs have consequences.\n\n&gt;It\'s very naive of you to think that DAESH care about theology but it\'s not really wrong.\n\nIt\'s a fact that they follow theology. It\'s not just their own, it\'s beyond just ISIS. They didn\'t start it, they emerged from it. Fanatics that follow these movements don\'t steal Islam, they emerge from it through some interpretation. You have bystander supporters of ISIS who describe their crimes, almost unanimously condemned as un-Islamic, as mistakes or results of ambiguity in interpretation, and not a reason to suddenly disregard the great re-emergent Caliphate as a whole. So even being against ISIS isn\'t enough to stifle their enthusiasm for the experiment in progress, while innocents suffer horrifically. Being objective enough to see that religion can be anything from the most benign of interpretations to something like ISIS, and everything in between, is not naivety. ISIS aren\'t all psychopaths, they are mostly people going with the flow, and it doesn\'t help that Islam defines their life in societal and moral terms, instead of something like human rights.\n\n&gt;Yes but as I said you really need to read the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim, many people today follow scholars and hadiths over the teachings of the Qu\'ran.\n\nAnd they have that prerogative. And if they ruled the world, that Islam would be the "true Islam" by popular vote, just as it was for the Christianity of the Middle Ages; no matter how condemned it is today, it was the "true Christianity". It\'s not our job as humans to point out "the true" incarnations of anything and everything in the universe. When an ISIS emerges, when the "many people who follow Hadith" emerge, that\'s a fact of reality. That\'s the type of Islam that exists today. Don\'t like it? Write a book, start a Youtube channel, preach Quranism, restart the Mu\'tazila sect, whatever... don\'t tell me who is or isn\'t doing Islam correctly. It\'s all folly to me and I don\'t accept your Quran-centrist view as anything other than another type of cherry picked Islam. \n\n&gt;Do you think the average person in this thread really care about that ? Do you think it\'s productive to alienate Muslims ?\n\nI think the most alienating thing to do to humans is to dehumanize them. I don\'t express my insulting views of Islam, or my insulting attitude towards you as an "apologist for this or that", because I\'m waging a war. It\'s because you are just a human to me, as worthy of regard as any other, and because Islam is just another ideology, as influential as any other. You have personal reasons to defend Islam in the standard way that you are, I have personal reasons to tell you why you\'re wrong. I don\'t think me telling Muslims what I think of their religion will de-alienate them or make us all friends, but I do believe in them enough as moral human beings that they won\'t join ISIS just because I\'m implying ISIS has validity. The best and the worst things that can happen is that I\'ll be called an Islamophobe, while I point out my views on why these religious views are outdated and dangerous. Good for those Muslims that live a good life for themselves or others, but ISIS is just a cancer that grows out of a sick organism. ISIS may be throwing gays off of rooftops, but the Muslim world isn\'t moving towards gay acceptance either. I see a connection. ISIS is just an unfortunate, extreme, but eye-opening aspect of the potential within Islam. You don\'t get this sort of stuff because your religion is too good to not be the "true will of God", you get this because the religion isn\'t all that it\'s cracked up to be.\n\n&gt;I guess you also think that taking prisoners is bad ?\n\nBy conquerors like Muslims in the name of Islam, so I can pay Jizya and be subjugated, if I\'m lucky? Yes.\n\n&gt;If you\'re a man of logic and reason you\'ll see that Islam was hijacked, just look at the comments here or websites using logical fallacies to criticize Islam, isn\'t that strange ?\n\nFor something to be hijacked it has to be something specific in the first place. Whatever Islam was, whatever Mohammad was, we don\'t know about it outside of Islamic sources, which you claim need correct interpretation themselves. There\'s not much external evidence of what early Islam was. All I know is that you have an Islam you believe is true and that I can\'t say anything that would convince you that you\'re wrong. What more is there to say?'

aS'&gt; i would need more than some pictures from a kid with an AK to lead my country into war. mob of dudes did something bad, lets kill millions, um no.\n\nHow about the twitter page officially run by the ISIS "government." Or the official videos made by ISIS. Or the widespread genocide (especially of the Yazidi peoples) and rapings that we *know* are happening. And the fact that the government does exactly fuck all to stem or even protest any of this.\n\nAnd bloody hell, ISIS has not been shy in stating that its official policy is to not just to kill non-Muslims, but also muslims from different sects than them. Or banning basic educational foundations like mathematics, science, and history from anything outside of the Qu\'ran.\n\n&gt; you can take accounts of well documented abuse by us soldiers as a relative handful of tragedies? \n\nYes, because there are. In any given conflict there are a relative handful of these cases. That is to say, that there *are* cases where US soldiers rape civilians, ormurder civilians under unjustifiable conditions. But these are relatively isolated cases, and not something that happens whenever the US enters a new city in a country.\n\nAnd even then, these cases are not only rare, but very small in scope. It\'s not American troops killing dozens and hundreds of innocent Yazidis for no reason. It\'s one shitty guy raping a girl, or one or two shitty guys killing a couple of people. It\'s not an American platoon slaughtering entire masses of innocent people for no justifiable reason. And unlike in the IS, most cases where this has happened, especially in the last 100 years or so, end with trials and massive flak and punishment for the perpetrators, whereas in the IS the "government" either encourages or says absolutely nothing about it.\n\nShow me the IS prosecuting someone for killing a Yazidi or what they consider a heretic/infidel, and I\'ll drop my argument. I\'ll be waiting.\n\n&gt;but one or four occurrences by ISIS is enough for you to approve a large regional war sure to kill millions?\n\nOne or four? What the bloody hell are you talking about? There have been dozens of cases of ISIS killing and beheading journalists. And dozens of cases of mass beheadings. And numerous cases of mass murders of Yazidis. And numerous cases of women being captured and sold as sex slaves. And this is over a period of time of less than a year.\n\n&gt;oh and murder is murder, the method is trivial\n\nSorry, but no. The world isn\'t so black and white that all bad things are equally bad. Bad isn\'t a monolith, not all bad things are the same kind of bad, and there is a sliding scale. In other words, we live in a world made up of different shades of grey.\n\nFor example, murdering someone because you were defending yourself is not equivalent to murdering someone out of cold blood. Furthermore, murdering someone by accident is not the same as premeditated murder - which is why pretty much any halfway decent legal system on the planet takes these things into consideration. Because not all similar bad actions are similarly bad.\n\nKilling someone as an unintended consequence of attacking a military target is *not* the same as killing someone just to kill them. It\'s terrible and a tragedy, yes, but it is not comparable in the slightest.\n\n&gt;america does the same barbaric things they do, proven in every war america has\n\nAgain, mind citing evidence for your baseless claim that the US has involved itself in behaviors that include genocide, taking losers as slaves, *sex slavery*, killing nonbelievers, and widespread cruel and unusual inhumane execution methods (by the standards of the time)?\n\n&gt;and theres lots of wars, its kind of americas thing to start brutal wars.\n\nExcept...America hasn\'t started most wars it\'s participated in? The Civil War was started when the South invaded Northern territory, the Vietnam War was started by North Vietnam, the Korean War was started by North Korea invading South Korea, the Mexican War was started when Meixcan Cavalry crossed into what the US considered its sovereign territory, the First Gulf War was started when Iraq invaded Kuwait, and World War I and World War II were already well under way when the US joined them. Hell, even the War of 1812 and the Tripolitan War are arguably defensive wars, as the US declared war on England because it kept illegally seizing Ameican ships and sailors, and the Tripolitan wars were fought to stop rampant piracy around Lybia.'

aS"Genocide and colonization are not the same thing.\n\nThe US has put a reasonable government together that does an okay job of providing for 300 million people. It's not perfect but it's okay. We certainly don't commit genocide or practice slavery in the modern era. ISIS is a step back by about 200 years. \n\nBy colonizing these middle eastern territories, we could actively suppress the negative aspects of their cultures, seek out and kill their worst individuals, and push a new set of values on their children. \n\nActually, if we did too complete a job of modifying their culture, it might meet some definitions of genocide. We would have to take care not to wipe out their cultural identity. "

But if we hadn't invaded, then one have to think whether or not ISIS would even exist in the first place, right?\n\nHad we only invaded Afghanistan. I'd be more inclined to agree with you. But we also absolutely destroyed Iraq's governing infrastructure and despite all the money and effort we threw at it- we left the place a smoldering and festering shit hole. \n\nI can't then also see why we should now be ignoring the predicate cause of ISIS' ability to exist, which can be traced directly back to US invading a sovereign nation upon the pretext of lies and bullshit.\nISIS is a Sunni outfit.\n \nSorry world.

aS'&gt; Yes there is. THe last time he did a "Kuwait" the repercussions after and how he behaved since the war. Very good reasons actually.\n\nHardly.  If he was so well behaved, the US wouldn\'t have passed the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998 on the grounds that "he committed various and significant violations of international law, had failed to comply with the obligations to which it [Iraq] had agreed following the Gulf War and further had ignored resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.  The Iraq Liberation Act passed 360-38 in the House, unanimously in the Senate, and was signed by President Clinton at that time.  In 1998, Clinton stated:\n\n&gt; Iraq admitted, among other things, an offensive biological warfare capability, notably, 5,000 gallons of botulinum, which causes botulism; 2,000 gallons of anthrax; 25 biological-filled Scud warheads; and 157 aerial bombs. And I might say UNSCOM inspectors believe that Iraq has actually greatly understated its production....\n\n&gt; Over the past few months, as [the weapons inspectors] have come closer and closer to rooting out Iraq\'s remaining nuclear capacity, Saddam has undertaken yet another gambit to thwart their ambitions by imposing debilitating conditions on the inspectors and declaring key sites which have still not been inspected off limits....\n\n&gt; It is obvious that there is an attempt here, based on the whole history of this operation since 1991, to protect whatever remains of his capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction, the missiles to deliver them, and the feed stocks necessary to produce them. The UNSCOM inspectors believe that Iraq still has stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions, a small force of Scud-type missiles, and the capacity to restart quickly its production program and build many, many more weapons....\n\n&gt; Now, let\'s imagine the future. What if he fails to comply and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route, which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the solemn commitments that he made? Well, he will conclude that the international community has lost its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you he\'ll use the arsenal....\n\nThat makes it very clear that Saddam wasn\'t concerned with the repercussions at all.\n\n&gt; AS bad as ISIS for the whole region? Come on!\n\nYes.  ISIS is currently causing untold suffering, but they will be rooted out.  They\'ll never run Iraq.  There\'s no telling how long Uday or Qusay would have been in power, but it would have been long enough to do some serious damage (that would most likely have involved chemical weapons).  It would be like giving ISIS a state to run.'

OF course, after being threatened by bush senior with invasion, a paranoid dictator like sadaam would stock up. And then he disarmed. \n\nSeriously, the very *last* thing anyone with sense to ever trust about iraq would be american statements between the two wars. I can't believe you take that at face value.\n\n&gt;ISIS is currently causing untold suffering, but they will be rooted out.\n\nANd replaced with what?

Only the angry or crazy people that want to see Sunni\'s exterminated want to take over Al-Anbar.\n\nHonestly, ISIS just attacked Saudi Arabia. If that\'s legit, there\'s a chance that the Saudi\'s are going to spend big bucks and funds to arm the shit out of the Sunnis to take on ISIS. The only reason ISIS came in the first place was to reject the Iraqi government\'s repression of Sunni territory. This also means that Iran won\'t have control of Al-Anbar through the Shia tribes.\n\nThe US has been saying it since the days for planning the "Awakening Movement". Everyone is fighting for their homes. The Sunni tribes have to be armed, unified, strong enough to push ISIS out, and respected enough by the Iraqi government to be allowed to exist. The problem is that the Iraqi government never treated the Sunni\'s right, that\'s what led to this in the first God damn place. Hell, it\'s practically the exact same problem it was in 2006.

ISIS isn\'t exactly a nonchalant and disorganized rabble. They have a much more sophisticated command structure, far more experience, and much better funding than AQI did. They can still give you a fight. You\'re right, you and a few thousand other Marines could plow your way to fucking Damascus, but it wouldn\'t solve anything.\n\nYou can fight ISIS forever, and they don\'t have a problem with that, they\'d be more that thrilled to take a few of your friends with them, and they will. If you fight *for* the Iraqis you\'ll never be finished with it. If you fight *with* the Iraqis then they\'ll fight for themselves.\n\nSending you to go fight and die for them doesn\'t accomplish anything but allow ISIS to jerk themselves over their martyred friends.

This was around the time of the Pahlavi rule, if I remember my history right. And then their equivalent of the Tea Party took over, killed the pacifists and forced everyone to conform to their extremist views.  Crusades didn\'t help much, either, which was the first major instance of Western ideology clashing with Eastern views. \n\nIt\'s a cycle that happens. But this particular cycle is homegrown. ISIS had roots with a lot of displaced Iraqi generals who hated the US when they invaded Iraq. To say that "they hated themselves already, so now they\'re hating everyone else" applies to almost everything in military history you can think of, so to claim this is only a Middle Eastern problem is being dismissive.'

aS'No, I\'m not 10... and by replying like this, it seems you might not know what the term means and why many of us suggest using the term DAESH in place of ISIS/ISIL, so I\'ll offer an explanation. \n\nDAESH at face value is simply an acronym for ISIL in Arabic () no more no less.  In fact DAESH isn\'t even an actual word.  But the Arabic verb , when used by those who oppose ISIS has the meaning "to thread underfoot, trample down."  So calling ISIS, DAESH is meant to be an insult.  It\'s meant to be a pejorative term, similar to Nazi.  \n\nThe Nazis didn\'t call themselves Nasis.  They called themselves the "Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"  Nazi was actually an insult long before the rise of Adolf Hitler. It was a derogatory term for a backwards peasant in Bavaria, from which the Nazis emerged. Those who opposed them seized on this and shortened the party\'s title Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, to "Nazi" as an insult.  So how are they remembered by everyone now?  By the insulting name Nazi... forever part of history being referred to by a name that insults them.\n\nThis is what DAESH deserve... they are a group just as terrible and depraved as the Nazis were.  They don\'t deserve to be recognized by a name they gave themselves.  They deserve to only be called by a name that puts them down with every use.  That is what history should remember, and at the very least it should be used to show support/solidarity to those to are actively opposing them.'

aS'Purely speculation from a man who knows little of the various cultures of the area and their intertwining intricacies. When I think about why such a large number of Iraqi forces would retreat, I can only come up with the following possibilities. \n\n1. They were unaware of the numbers ISIS was fielding. Fearing being overwhelmed, they backed out.\n\n2. It was purely a strategic retreat. This could be related to logistics, information gathering, or a myriad of reasonable possibilities that we would not be informed of. \n\n3. Sympathy. \n\nThe absolute worst case scenario I can imagine is some or all of the Iraqi military / government deciding that they would fall under the banner of ISIS. The fall of Iraq. At that point, the Islamic State would be an actual regime with borders, a standing military, and a hell of a lot of weapons. Soon after which WW3 would be under full swing, as they would certainly continue to pursue Syria and Yemen. \n\nAgain, arm chair speculation based purely on my interest in the crazy ass shit going on in the middle east.

No.  They\'re locals - with the overwhelming majority of their victims being Muslims who don\'t agree with their brutality.\n\n*Now here\'s where the problem lies and why ISIS is getting stronger by the day.*\n\nOf the nations who can rise up against ISIS - there\'s the Western and Industrialized powers, all of our nations - US, Canada, European nations, Australia ... we\'re all fatigued thanks to Bush\'s fake wars based on lies. \n\nNow that leaves the regional powers:  \n\nSyria was smashed due to a civil war.  \n\nIraq is a smoldering wreck thanks to a decade of war.\n\nThe Saudis are a bunch of pompous eunuchs.  They usually get other people to fight their wars (USA vs Iraq x 2) \n\nTurkey ... I have no idea, but they seem to see that there are problems - and they\'re training the Kurdish Pashmergas instead now of fighting with them.\n\nJordan - has a double humanitarian crisis of Palestinian refugees and Syrian refugees ; their already fragile economy is near its breaking point.  They have retaliated, but they\'re a very small nation.   Holding the line on their border seems to be the priority.\n\nLebanon - is another smoldering wreck. \n\nEgypt just came out of a civil war, and is a mess.\n\nYemen is a mess thanks to rebels.\n\nThe gulf states?

It has everything to do with a President trying to take a more cautious approach to the Middle east in an effort to get the other nations in the region to take a more active role. Meaning, he has made it clear that he will *help* all the nations that are actively fighting ISIS. But he doesnt want to do the bulk of the fighting *for them*. \n\nIts *their* fight, and they need to lead it.\n\n\nIf McCain or Romney would have won the election, we would have had boots on the ground already.\n\n\nIm not saying either choice of action is incorrect. It doesn\'t matter if we *actively* fight ISIS with soldiers in the region, or if we *passively* fight ISIS with Airstrikes and targeted assassinations/capture like we\'ve been doing.\n\nWhat matters is the execution. Either tactic can work with the right plan in action.\n\n\nNobody "wants" any war. Not this one. Not the Afghanistan War. Not the Iraq War. Not the Korean War. Not WWI or II. \n\n\n*"Want"* is irrelevant in these matters. If US soldiers weren\'t willing to fight wars, then they wouldn\'t have signed up and taken an oath to fight when called to do so. Nobody forced them to join the service. \n\n\nIt was *their choice*...\n\n\nSometimes you have to recognize that violence and warfare is necessary to avert or destroy threats to yourself, your country, your allies, or your assets.

How would it propose to get there? Would its primary thrust be military, political, economic or religious? Would it be based on the assumption that simply pouring on sufficient traditional military power would prevail against perpetual, low-level, asymmetrical warfare fought by guerillas that can and will seamlessly blend into the civilian populace when it is to their advantage? Who have shown themselves capable of wearing down *massive* logistical superiority by simply being willing and able to subsist for *years* on little but rice, tea, goats-milk yogurt and the occasional chicken?? \n\nCould attempting such a traditional military solution even be considered a *sane* thing to do, considering that very strategy has now failed abysmally, even for military superpowers, *three consecutive times*? Where would the money for it come from? Which Western nations would participate? Which local nations? Which of the Gulf\'s current political leaders, factions, administrators, key players, *eminences grises* and warlords hiding deep in the hills would we prop up, and which would we cast down?\n\nI mean, other than not bothering to differentiate allies and innocents from enemies, and just indiscriminately killing *everyone* between the Nile and the Khyber Pass, exactly what would your proposed "long term strategy" look like?

In fact the government recently arrested soldiers who apprehended a convoy of weapons heading to Jihadists in Syria... That should show who they are supporting. I\'ve read a story about a nurse in a Turkish border town who objected to having to treated wounded ISIS members everyday.\n\nEven this Jihadist said they have members to transport this girl and safehouses in Turkey. I don\'t think they\'ve done a single attack against that country even though its government is probably more secular than Assad\'s.\n\nBut yeah, I read an article and some oil smugglers were saying that at night in certain spots convoys of trucks line up with barrels of oil and they roll them across the border to awaiting trucks. They resell the oil in Turkey and make a good profit. So they make a lot of money that way.\n\nISIS also stole $500 million cash in Iraqi Dinars when they took Mosul. They have supporters who give them money. They have captured a lot of their weapons and ammo from the Iraqi army. At one point they had a convoy of American humvees and artillery. The Iraqi army is too incompetent to destroy this stuff. They also outnumbered ISIS greatly in Ramadi but somehow lost without putting up a fight. They\'re a joke basically. They\'ve barely taken back any territory yet. I think the Kurds have taken more back.\n\nIn terms of banking support, I\'d be surprised if any bank supported them. I\'m not sure what they would get out of that investment. They do get donations from rich oil sheikh types in Gulf States though. Not directly from any governments (though that could be a possibility), but instead from shady/creepy fundamentalists. I think aid still comes into Raqqa and other towns because the outside world doesn\'t want them to starve, so when it comes to food they could just steal some of that.\n\nSo yeah:\n\nWeapons: they\'ve captured A LOT. A lot of ammo too. They use a lot of VBIEDS which only require explosives and cars. They also manufacture mortar rounds and other explosives with lathes and some basic skills. They definitely have manpads and ATGMs also.\n\nFood: they can skim from donations and also force local farmers to \'donate\' food to them. They mostly hold desert territory but along some of the rivers they control I\'m sure there\'s a bit of food production.\n\ncash: They captured $500 million from one bank alone. They sell oil. They ransom people they\'ve kidnapped including Yazidis they\'ve enslaved. They charge a tax on everyone in their territory, and charge Christians extra. I don\'t think many Christians have stayed but I\'m sure some have and pay the tax. Theoretically they are supposed to be treated ok if they pay. '

There isn't a strong national identity or inspiring cause to fight for.  Most people have just come accustomed to trying to keep their heads down, getting out of the way and focusing on surviving.\n\nIf you look at the US response to all this you can really understand why too.  We leave in a hurry after having to do a huge troop surge to quash sectarian fighting in the first place.  Then when ISIS shows up we do next to nothing to actually support the country militarily.  Yeah some airstrikes to help out, but we should have had boots on the ground a while ago.  ISIS is some of the worst scum to crop up since WW2.  They literally practice genocide, mass rape, slavery and virtually every other crime against humanity out there and no one in the Western world or the UN is doing anything of substance to actually shatter that organization.\n\nThis is where the US screws up every single time.  We break a country down, kind of rebuild it, leave and then do nothing as it slowly descends into chaos again and wonder why in 20 years you'll have a lot of hungry resentful young men cursing us.\n\nObamas foreign policy has a been a goddamn disaster in the last three years.  Russia is quickly turning back into an aggressive, militaristic dictatorship.  Egypt and Libya are destabilized.  Yemen predictably fell apart and is threatening to spark a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  ISIS has strongly established itself in both Syria and Iraq.  Oh and let's not forget the fact that Saudi Arabia might be looking to acquire nuclear weapons now that we've legitimized Iran's nuclear program.\n\nIt was a terrible decision to try to engage Iran.  They have no interest in democracy or cooperation and the second things started looking shaky they were shelling merchant ships again.  We managed to piss off the last large, stable and consistently diplomatically receptive state in the region by negotiating with it's long standing enemy in the region.  All this I might add after Saudi Arabia is undergoing a regime change of its own with a lot of unknowns.\n\nI don't get how we can continue to make the exact same mistakes over and over again without learning anything in the process, but somehow politicians always find a way."

You cant form an army with american ties, representative of the US in some way, without the commander in chief (potus); it\'s in the constitution. \n\nnext, consider what ISIS means in a region that Israel is no longer willing to destabilize. Then consider what ISIS can do to what has become an even more dissociated from the US, Iraqi government; in terms of US economic deals, if it has to "go back in". Then think, "these ISIS guys really are establishing a need for the US in the region", and a homogeneity (cooperation) of usually rival nations, in offering themselves up as regional villeins for everyone to fight - together.\n\nWhat if ISIS, in effect, serves a purpose that would help the US in its diplomatic and geo-strategic efforts; if the regional tension lasts a little bit longer. What if the US is not only welcomed but demanded in the region by IRAQ this time. . .then we get to set the standard and terms of our occupation; while relieving US need for Israel, and its US politic confounding ways (Israel lobby)\n\nFurther still, the US uses many mercenary companies, called "contractors". These men were hired and used heavily in OIF. Doing jobs that would be too politically costly if they should die.\n\nYou see, When a merc dies, people say, "live by the sword, die by the sword". When a soldier dies, we have memorial day and movies made about them (Chris Kyle for example). These mercs aforementioned are indeed used by the military and are not under the control of the president as per say in the constitution- so much as the presidents men or the representatives of the government who hires them.  \n\nwhat you are suggesting is an army with no national affiliation, and that is the very thing we spent 13 years combating - it\'s called an insurgency. The rule of law must apply, and as such the sovereignty of nation willing to abide by it and hold representation of its fighters, else you\'re nothing but the definitive "Terror" in the "war on terror".

There is a cause and effect relationship between what scripture and religious culture encourages, allows, or forbids, and what its followers do.\n\nThe thinking of the 'new' atheist movement of the 21st century has included the idea that religion is innately harmful, because it incubates beliefs which are almost certainly not true, and the moderates of the faiths enable the fundamentals, who take some nasty and harmful old literature literally.\n\nUltimately, we are talking about the fact that ISIS are taking and trafficking in sex-slaves. They are, they tell us, following their scripture, and the [scripture explicitly allows the taking and trafficking of sex slaves.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_malakat_aymanukum#Sexual_relations_with_captives) So, I think you should examine your motive in raising the issues of other religions.

They [the Saudis] are happy to sit back and watch Iran lose its allies to the ISIS carnage. \n\nPretty much this. The Houthi rebels are Shia militants backed by Iran. ISIS is a Sunni militant organization backed by Saudi benefactors.\n\nThe Sunni vs. Shia conflict will always trump all other crimes and atrocities in the Middle East. The Sunni states will let ISIS do whatever they want, so long as they don't threaten their own power.\n\nAs it stands now, ISIS is only wreaking havoc in Syria and Iraq, two countries with a Shia majority. If they start launching attacks in Saudi Arabia or Turkey, they'll be destroyed fairly quickly, and all sides in the conflict know that."

aS'This black and white thinking is exactly what I\'m cautioning against. Every time there is a thread on ISIS posts are filled with "kill them all", "destroy them", and general desire to act first and think later.\n\nI\'m aware ISIS is bad. As most Westerners I\'m against religious extremism in any manner. Even if it wasn\'t so chaotic I would agree they are bad, just like Saudi Arabia is.\n\nBut then take the other side. They are a militia bred out of anarchy and civil war. Even the most peaceloving defense force will have some degree of violence. Remember the guy on "our" side eating the heart of his enemy? You should never expect a force in war, especially one born of extremism and an anarchic civil war, to be good. *This* is the horror of war. *This* is what war is. \n\nIn the West we\'re increasingly being taught about "casualty-less" war. The idea we can try humanitarian wars where ever and whenever because we learned how to reduce collateral damage. Well, ISIS is collateral damage. When we invaded Iraq it was EXACTLY the same notion of "this guys is evil!", "we must stop him!" horseshit. \n\nThat is simplicity! That is not reality! So go ahead and do "something". I\'m sure you know exactly what to do, and I\'m sure by "we" you mean you personally will be fixing it. But don\'t do it in my name, because your bandwagoning, simplistic, black and white, "Boo enemy!" thinking leads me to believe you people haven\'t thought anything through, don\'t know what the fuck you\'re talking about, and will fuck it up even more *again*.

aS'&gt;You need to understand the difference between genocide and justice.\n\nJustice is an opinion. So are you saying everyone who feels genocide is justified, it is an act of justice, is entitled to kill people? If you feel "justice" is something that gives permission to eliminating people, why wouldn\'t ISIS have the same right to kill people according to their sense of "justice"? What makes your sense of justice objectively better than the sense of justice of other people?\n\n&gt;We have capital punishment. Why? Because it is justice to remove those who have committed the worst of crimes. \n\nWe (the EU) don\'t. Why? Because the right to live is a human right, and regardless of your actions, you still remain a human being, and as such, it is not justice to murder you because of your actions.\n\n&gt;Yes, you have human rights, right up to the point where you violate the human rights of others. At that point, you no longer have those rights, whereas your status is refined as a criminal.\n\nSo they are not human rights in your world view. They are privileges. \n\nSomeone being a criminal does not change the fact that they are still human beings. They do not cease to be human beings when they are found guilty.\n\n&gt;Criminal is a reduced state of existence.\n\nNo it is not. Criminal is someone who has been found guilty of a crime in a court. Criminals are still human. No law can reduce their humanity, as the law does not change their humanity.\n\nAlso, ISIS could say this:\n\n&gt;Being infidel is a reduced state of existence. And that is why it is perfectly righteous to rid the earth of those who are infidel. They are infidels committing acts that are at this point against the will of God.\n\nNow, does that seem right? If you have the right to decide that some statement by a cultural institution you believe in (court of law) reduces a state of existence, surely ISIS has the right to the same?\n\n&gt;If you think not, then you had might as well be an ISIS supporter and lit the fire that burned this woman alive yourself.\n\nSo, you are saying all the EU countries might as well be ISIS supporters, because EU countries have a binding agreement on human rights? You claim that because the EU charter on fundamental rights starts [like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/04CFREU-Article2-Crop.jpg/1280px-04CFREU-Article2-Crop.jpg) the EU is comparable to ISIS?\n\nWhereas you are not comparable to ISIS, because unlike the EU, and just like ISIS, you see it fit to murder people when you feel it is "justified" by their acts? You are not comparable to ISIS, because unlike the EU, and just like ISIS, you see it fit to reclassify some human beings into "a reduced state of existence" so it is righteous to murder them?'

aS'You would be mistaken to think that capturing any given city would actually strengthen ISIS. Maybe they would get a few more recruits at best. If anything they are only overextending themselves as they take more territory than they can control. The only thing that could strengthen them is when they capture weapons left behind by the Iraqis. We need to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of ISIS. Towns? Not so much.\n\nI mean, look at it this way: did capturing all of Iraq do anything to increase the strength of the US military. No, it only weakened it by overextending our forces. ISIS faces the same problem. The only difference is that, for them, Iraq has some weapons that are worth taking.'

aS"Look. In a funny twist of fate the US and Iran have seen there geo political goals become intertwined. They both hate ISIS and want to knock the Saudis down a peg. They also want to keep Iraq intact but militarily impotent. This newfound cooperation has also seemingly extended to the nuclear talks that seemed to be stalled before. \n\nThe main question is how are they going to beat ISIS. They are hashing this out right now. I think it will take some time but I don't see how they can fail. ISIS as a state is completely screwed. No one is going to accept it as a country and they have no way to force a favorable military outcome. Assad is holding out in Damascus and ISIS loses support the farther south they drive. If they sit still they are weakened from air strikes. Also the Iraqis are eventually going to become a fighting force of some competence. My basic conclusion is that ISIS days are number."

That the US made a mistake by disbanding the army and replacing it with a bunch of incompetent people? That's what I was pointing out. The army is Shia dominated, but ISIS has mostly made its gains in the Sunni dominated northwest of Iraq. Sunni soldiers in the region have little loyalty to the Shia government and have no motivation to risk their lives fighting for it.\n\nWhat's your second point? That the US needs to fix this because they messed up the country in the first place? Sure, that would be the moral thing to do, but in practice, the more they get involved, the more fundamentalism is bred, the more things go to shit. Further intervention by external powers and more puppet governments isn't going to fix the Middle East, as has been proven by the last 100 years of Western meddling in the region, it's only resulted in destabilisation."

After all, murder is murder is murder is murder.\n\nAlso, ISIS aren\'t proclaiming themselves to the followers of a pacifist, Jew, the so-called "Prince of Peace" (ie Jesus Christ) who *specifically and repeatedly commanded* his followers to *always and only* ever practice non-violence.

aS'What created chaos was not the removal of Saddam per se, but the policies implemented by the CPA.\n\nFurthermore, ISIS did not arise from the removal of Saddam. IIRC the removal of Saddam happened a decade before ISIS, something the New Left (which actually agrees with the likes of Kissinger, go figure) tends to omit from their account of things. No, ISIS arose not from the American presence in Iraq, but from the lack of it (or any other formidable force to enforce peace). They began as a pack of thugs, and there was no one there to stop them.\n\nA wise man once said: "Any critique of realism has to begin with a sober assessment of the horrors of peace." Many mistakes were committed in Iraq. But had there been no invasion, there could have well been a WMD (chemical) war between Iraq and Iran, and a great plethora of other fun scenarios in which many more people would have died than did due to the US invasion in 2003.\n\nAnyway, I am glad the scales are starting to tip away from the Chomskyists.

There was a case, I know for a fact, that a man left ISIS (and was promptly arrested when he returned home) because they stopped paying him.

aS'"It is accepted that AQ is (indirectly) blowback from Operation Cyclone. Of course there were added elements, Pashtun tribes, Pakistan\'s ISI, Saudi backing."\n\n---Al Qaeda is not "blowback" from Operation Cyclone and this argument is "accepted" only by the liberal narrative which absolutely dominates this discussion. Outside of the liberal bubble ,that insists you put on historical blinders, you\'ll find these glaring facts: Al Qaeda didn\'t exist during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda was created by OBL in response to Islams teachings that Christians being in Saudi Arabia was a sin. The Islamic jurisprudence that dictates that all muslims must fight any non-believers in muslim lands is the catalyst for these groups opposing the Soviets when they invaded Afghanistan and when they opposed westerners who were defending Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It didn\'t matter to Al Qaeda whether the non-believers were attacking or defending muslims lands- what mattered to them was they were simply there. To suggest the U.S. created these groups because they were simply there or because the U.S. joined them in their fight against the Soviets is absurd. \n\n"As for ISIS, America\'s responsibility lies in destabilizing the region (Bush\'s adventurisms) and more recently covert arming of Syrian rebels through CIA Lybia-Syria "rat line"" \n\n---Once again the liberal narrative ,that Bush created ISIS, absolutely insists on historical blinders that dictate history began in 2003. The simple fact that melts this narrative is that [ISIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) was founded in 1999 by Jordanian radical Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as Jamat al-Tawd wa-al-Jihd, "The Organisation of Monotheism and Jihad" (JTJ) *before* Bush was even president. Once again an Islamic group was not motivated by oil or U.S. money or some covert operation but by Islamic jurisprudence. These groups entered Iraq *after they were created* to fight non-believers. The U.S. defeated these groups and when the U.S. left Iraq in 2011 ISIS had zero power. It was only after the U.S. left Iraq that Maliki proceeded to purge the Iraqi government and military of Sunni groups. The Syrian civil war was then the context in which ISIS grew as a military power. Those are the facts.\n\n"And lastly the whole shebang of (modern) Islamic Terrorism had its roots in Petro-Islam"  \n\n--This is absolutely false and easily proven by historical facts. Islamic militancy against the U.S. existed before oil. In fact our first war overseas was against Muslims who were murdering and enslaving Americans because of their religion. \n\n"In March 1785, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams went to London to negotiate with Tripoli\'s envoy, Ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja). When they enquired "concerning the ground of the pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury", the ambassador replied:\n\nIt was written in their Koran, that all nations which had not acknowledged the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave; and that every mussulman who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise." \n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War\n\n--- What Sidi Haji Abdrahaman told Thomas Jefferson and John Adams in 1785 is *exactly the same doctrine* that ISIS uses in 2015 to justify their slaughter of non-believers. Oil did not create these groups. Bush did not create these groups. They would still exist if the U.S. didn\'t exist. They would still exist if Bush was never born. They would still exist if oil had never been discovered. The U.S. did not create these groups\n\nI vote Democrat and I criticize Bush all the time but I cringe when the left wing narrative ignores history.

So Assad is about red-white-and-blue as it gets). ISIS are hell-bent on killing...pretty much everyone.\n\nThe videos you showed are horrible only for someone who has never been in any sort of military. Collateral damage happens during in-city fighting. Even Israel manages to kill a lot of civilians - and their technology is beyond anything Syrians have, its not like Syrian army has precision weapons. I guarantee you they are not flying around thinking "OK, here is ISIS, and here are civilians. Let\'s find the biggest group of women and children we can bomb." They are actually trying to *defend* their country against ISIS. And instead of helping them (by, you know, giving some precison weapons - so that civilian losses can be reduced to a minimum), the West hypocritically plants the blame on those fighting with whatever they have.\n\nBesides, I am not sure what is the fuss about barrel bombs. They are not much different from ordinary bombs, just a lot less powerful and accurate. \n\nAs far as chemical weapons go - if I recall correctly, at least a couple of those attacks were proven to be false flag operations by the islamists.

While battered in battles for fallujah and ramadi, it obviously didn't die.  \n\nA better explanation of the U.S.' motives in Iraq is to not allow US support to become the crutch that it was for a decade, the removal of which would leave the Iraqi security forces as crippled as it was at the end of OIF.  Iraqi success in tikrit, Mosul, and now ramadi will depend on the strength of the Iraqi security forces with limited support from the air.  There's little doubt a full intervention by the U.S. would remove major ISIS holdouts within months, but doing so prevents any strengthening of the Iraqi security forces.  And while it's frustrating to you, the untrained observer, to see ISIS make gains in the face of limited US intervention, it's for the greater good of the security forces of Iraq "

aS"I never said if I was pro or against intervention. Regardless, what you just said agrees with what I just wrote. :) The US doesn't want to be 'that guy' again, is letting things take care of themselves. \n\nAnd I disagree they didn't exist in the same strength as in 2005. Here in London, there are plenty of young girls heading for Syria to become brides of ISIS. And it certainly wasn't happening during the Iraq War. AQIZ/ISIS who cares, ISIS is stronger and it wouldn't be if it was 2005. "
p1847
aS'Considering that ISIS rose within the brutal confines of the Syriam Civil war a year after the last american pulled out of Iraq, Im going to have to disagree with you there.'

aS"I can't help thinking Assad supports or at least lets ISIS do it's thing in Syria because they have been effective in shutting down the FSA rebellion against him. While Syrians are fighting ISIS or being subjugated by them, they aren't attacking Assad regime forces. "
p1851
aS"&gt; So you are agreeing with ISIS that it is OK to enslave the women you capture?\n\nI didn't write that anywhere. The Kurdish women are were free women, who did not declare war on ISIS, and even if they did, ISIS isn't even a legitimate country or state or group anyway who would have this right.\n\n&gt; Are you going to tell me that this Hadith is talking about consensual sex with captured women being held for ransom?\n\nThis hadith gives allowance for a certain birth control method. It does not give permission for non-consensual sex. Islam has forbidden that and does not give exception for it."

aS"That's how bad IT is getting these days. People would literally rather join ISIS"
p1853
aS"ISIS exists because of failed american policy in Iraq and a wrongful invasion of Iraq under the pretence of WMD's that did not exist.\n\nBut yes... it is not their problem after the massive power vacuum they created and allowed ISIS to flourish after dismantling the Iraqi army."
p1854
aS"Assad has killed many more people through indiscriminate bombing of entire cities than ISIS. ISIS is despicable, but make no mistake, it only seems worse in its atrocities because of the way they consciously emphasize them in their propaganda.

aS'The overwhelming majority of people living in the Caliphate happen to be Sunni Muslims.  ISIS is as brutal as it is portrayed in the media, this is undeniable. However the "civilized " western Invaders that use advanced Fighter Jets to bomb Civilians are well not really any less barbaric.  You just are given the impression that it is honorable to invade and occupy Muslim land in the western media.the fact is that many more Iraqi civilians have died at the hands of Bush/Cheney than at the hands of ISIS. there is a reason why mosul and ramadi fell so easily. the Iraqi Sunni population has no other choices. the Shiites and the puppet Iraqi government will oppress them.   '
p1859
aS"The one thing I don't wonder about people joining ISIS is why. I understand why. Western societies post scarcity are boring. \n\nPeople running away to war is as old as war itself. Remember the Spanish civil war how British men ran away to join the republicans? \n\nMen young and old love war. \n\nISIS provides the chance for meaning and excitement of war and power and struggle in a modern world where such things are the domain of the elite and the rest of us are kept in placid fat servitude.\n\nI am an man and an atheist. I know atheists and Christians who have run away converted to Sunni Islam all to join Isis. I would join Isis if not for their brutality.\n\nI have been considering joining other groups though like the Kurds."

aS"Actually realistically they can't even if they tried. North Korea doesn't have the means to invade the middle east and ISIS doesn't have the means to invade North Korea. "
p1861
aS"Saudi has some self-preservation to consider, too. How many ISIS attacks have there been in Saudi Arabia? Not a whole lot... Maybe just that mosque attack a few days ago? How many more attacks would their be if the Saudis went on all-out war against ISIS? Saudi Arabia has a big-ass land border with Iraq. Also, consider how many individual Saudi citizens might be sympathetic with ISIS. \n\nThe House of Saud doesn't want attacks in Saudi Arabia, and they don't want to end up like the Shah in Iran and be overthrown by a deeply religious citizenry. They have to tiptoe around this one. "

aS"Iran had a leader that actually cared about it's people before we overthrew him in 1954.\n\nAl-Qaeda's roots start with the CIA encouraging them to fight the Soviets in the 80s.\n\nISIS had a lot easier time getting a foothold after we created a power vacuum in Iraq in 2003 and in Syria in 2011.\n\nI'm not saying the United States created ignorance and hate but it sure didn't bring freedom or stability."
p1867
aS'For years after US took out evil dictator that had killed *millions*: Why is the US still in Iraq killing terrorists? Get the fuck out!!!\n\nUS left, everyone that wanted them out celebrated.\n\nNow that ISIS is killing tens of thousands: Where are the US troops? WTF? Get over here and kill terrorists!'
p1868
aS"It is not as big a threat as it is made out to be. The only reason it exists is because the countries in the region allow it. The big boy politics of the middle east is Sunni vs Shia power struggle and I'm sure you've seen with the Huthis in Yemen how everybody is lining up to have their dick measured. Now ISIS is bad for the Sunni powers, but it is considered(in their minds at least) to be a much worse threat for the Shias. So the prominent countries in the region have no reason to put serious effort in stopping ISIS because it is wrecking havoc on Tehran's sphere of influence. \n\n\nThe only serious fighting force ISIS have come across are the Peshmerga units of the Kurds, the Syrian army and maybe small elements in Iraq that are backed by Iran. But the Peshmerga are too small and the most they can do is defend their own. The Shia dominated forces of Iraq might not be that eager to die to liberate Sunni territory from a Sunni extremist group and Iran might fear the escalation of the Sunni vs Shia struggle if it sent a larger force into Iraq. The Syrian army, which has been fighting a civil war against western backed FSA, Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra front, Saudi backed Army Of Conquest and ISIS is the only determined force in the region that still has a bite that is trying to destroy ISIS. But It's fighting too many enemies and is in a much weaker state.\n\n\ntl;dr; ISIS is an effective tool in regional politics. And it only looks strong by comparison to the weak states of the region."

aS'So, does this mean ISIS is getting its wish of ending Sykes-Picot?'

aS'IT chief at Coca-Cola? Remind me again how all those who join ISIS are poor, uneducated, discriminated against, and lack perspective for the future!  '
p1876
aS"What really should people go mad is the absence of the question 'who is funding and assisting ISIS ?' , and why is everyone avoiding pointing fingers at Turkey who are so OBVIOUSLY supporting them with weapons, logistics and anything else a terrorist could ask for. \n\n4example I've been watching Charlie Rose for couple months now and he had, like always, all the guests with the authority to speak about this issue u could ask for, diplomats from all over the region and former and current US military officials. All he does is asking about how to stop/fight ISIS yet he never asks about their backers. All their brand new Toyota Pick-up's, their superior weaponary, strategies and amount of money without any help from outside is absolutely impossible...\n\nSome leaders in the region were very pissed, that Obama did say 'NO' to Syria intervention and that he wasn't fooled by this staged gas attack @Damascus eventhough the UN-inspectors were in town.\n\nSince that incident ISIS has grown and grown and does everything to gain the worlds attention by display of their barbarism. \n\nImho Obama as commander in chief acted the right way by refusing to let once again young americans die for Sunni/Saud's interests in the region. It's time for them to grow up and deal with their issues themselves.  "
p1877
aS"Yeah, I stopped paying attention to the Syrian civil war back in November, when people were predicting the rebels were going to collapse.  Assad was supposedly close to taking Aleppo, and Al Nusra had, I think, just split off from the other Syrian rebels.  \n\nFlash forward to today, and the rebels have taken Idlib and seem intent on cutting off the regime's supply lines to Aleppo.  ISIS has taken most of the (sparsely populated) Eastern half of the country, and the regime seems to be making no advances in the Southern part of the country near the Jordanian border (presumably where the rebels are getting supplies).  \n\nThe regime's not looking too hot right now.  They certainly were playing with fire when they let ISIS take out some of the rebel positions in the North, but it looks like it's heavily sapping their morale now."
p1878
aS'&gt; The international alliance is not providing enough support compared with ISIS capabilities on the ground in Anbar, said Maj. Muhammed al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi officer in Anbar Province, which contains Ramadi. The U.S. airstrikes in Anbar didnt enable our security forces to resist and confront the ISIS attacks, he added. We lost large territories in Anbar because of the inefficiency of the U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.\n\nNo you fucknut, you lost those territories because your military is a fucking joke. The coalition could carpet bomb the whole fucking area, and even if a single ISIS fighter remained, your guys would drop their guns, abandon their tanks, and run away.  '
p1879
aS"Probably not. North Korea actually has some decency and resemblance to a (half assed) society, not much mind you, and only in certain social areas of society, but it still exists. ISIS is just a bunch of childish adults with guns and a religion they can warp to their agenda. \n\nIn North Korea you are killed for political differences, in the islamic state, it's for religious ones. Both suck to be honest, but then again, why would you escape North Korea and then pick Libya of all places?"
p1880
aS'North Korea will nuke ISIS till it glows!'
p1881
aS'The entire thing is a clusterfuck at this point.  The 5 remaining players in the Syrian conflict seem to be the regime, ISIS, the Kurds, Al Nusra, and other rebel factions.  Al Nusra is Al Qaeda\'s affiliate branch in Syria, and ISIS was expelled from Al Qaeda for being too extreme.  The Kurds (Rojava?) seem interested only in their homelands, and the "remaining rebels" which I would broadly categorize as the "good" rebels that might have a semblance of being moderate or secular, are getting torn apart in Northern Syria.  '
p1882
aS"Why aren't they at least worried? And the more important question, why is ISIS pretending Israel doesn't exist?"
p1883
aS"No matter what you're led to believe, what's going on in the Middle East right now has absolutely nothing to do with religion. ISIS might claim they're on some holy mission, but anyone with half a brain is able to see that is just propaganda to recruit more soldiers to their cause. It's all about power. ISIS have seen the instability born from Western influence in the region and seek to exploit that. That is it, plain and simple. No holy war, no serving god, just opportunistic powergrabbing. At this point, it's too late and any Western action to undo what they caused in the first place will just lead to an even bigger clusterfuck, we just have to let it play out and hope the 'good guys' win.\n\nEDIT: Wow people are realllllyyyyy fucking stupid. I'm from one of the major Western countries that instigated the Iraq war and I can say it was completely our fault and we fucked up. Stop thinking the West is only trying to help because you couldn't be farther from the fucking truth."
p1884
aS'ISIS is going to get so fucked up in not to long.  They\'re pissing everyone off.  You\'re starting to get countries that haven\'t talked to each other is years saying "Hey, We hate you still but we gotta do something about ISIS."  It could jump start some foreign relations.'

When the U.S. took over, we completely 100% dismantled his entire regime instead of integrating it, which led to massive unemployment and resentful powerful Sunnis. ISIS was born directly because Saddam, and his government, was deposed.'

They are keenly aware that other fundamentalist leaders can live by their own rules while the Everyman has his freedoms removed to stabilize their position. Particularly if the consumption/rule breaking is done in an intelligent manner and not flaunted to the masses. If you can remove yourself from the horrible acts, you'd have to admire the ingenuity of the power grab.

Do you want me to start posting verses from The Quran and the Hadith which show a plausible connection to ISIS' motivations?  Because we both know these are trivially easy to find.\n\nBTW - I just googled 'ISIS and alcohol' and all the links I'm seeing are showing me that they're (surprise!) publicly strongly against the consumption of liquor.

aS"&gt; Are you saying there are hordes of young Muslim men just waiting for the final straw to shift their opinions to going over and fighting for ISIS?\n\nYes. Exactly this. ISIS isn't that different from existing Islamist ideologies, and declaring itself a caliphate has had a noticable impact."
p1933
aS"&gt;and they have literally no support within the Muslim world as they are rejected by scholars and people alike.\n\nWell that's *clearly* wrong.  They obviously have some support from within the Muslim world, given that all of their fighters come *from* that world. \n\nI suppose your point is that they don't have large support.  And I hope that's true.  Unfortunately however, there are large numbers of Muslims who defend similar ideals to the ones that ISIS claims to represent -- i.e. Islamist goals of establishing a Caliphate and imposing Sharia.  Punishments for apostasy, etc.\n\nBut, I don't want to get too hung up quantifying how many Muslims have how much sympathy for extremism and I'm well aware that there are vast numbers of moderates.  Rather, my focus is on the *ideology* of Islam and whether it can be said to be responsible for problems like ISIS.  And I think it is.  Even if 99% of Muslims are non-violent, it still wouldn't prove to me that Islam is not a problem.\n\n&gt;Islam does not have a pope like figure\n\nDon't care.  I think this line of argument is just another way of trying to deflect the blame from Islam.  \n\nEdit:  Baa!  Baa!  "

If they are crushed, ISIS says that they were not connected to them and loses no face; if they manage to control land ISIS says they are a legitimate branch. This way ISIS can post a new map showing how big territory they have conquered so far."

That religion is what ISIS is using to motivate seemingly every decision they do. That doesn't mean that ISIS are correct in their interpretation but to say ISIS has nothing to do with Islam would be false in my opinion. "

aS'Plus, if there were a power vacuum that did help create ISIS, it was in Eastern Syria. ISIS has been there since before we left Iraq. They could have waited in Eastern Syria for another 5-10 years if we had decided to stay, and then launched the same offensive, taking the same ground in Iraq.'

aS"&gt;The foot soldiers themselves might be motivated by religion, but the leaders of the operation themselves are almost certainly using it as a tool to misguide ranks of gullible people to get them to join and fight.\n\nYou say, 'almost certainly'.  Please provide me with the source of your certainty.  \n\n&gt;Isolation and bigotry, which can be seen pretty clearly in threads like these is part of the problem.\n\nPerhaps, but these sorts of charges are also commonly used to deflect criticism from Islam.  And, as far as I'm concerned, you can't be bigoted against an ideology.  \n\n&gt;It just leads to people cherry-picking whatever quotes they want to prove whatever agenda they have.\n\nTo some extent I agree.  Good people can find verses to support their views, but so can bad people find verses which support theirs.  However, I don't think that we should completely ignore the content of the texts themselves.  Not all ideologies are created equal, and some ideologies can have intrinsically bad or dangerous parts, which *must* be open to criticism.  \n\n&gt;attempting to cleanse entire ethnic groups, etc. I don't know about you, but it seems to me that these people are guided by a little more than religion.\n\nWhy?  The ethnic groups they're targeting are those from other religious sects.  Are ISIS targeting *any* Sunni Muslim groups?"
p1941
aS'That could go over badly, especially with a group known to slaughter civilians in mass.  It reminds me of the plans Anonymous made to "fight" the Mexican drug cartels.  \n\nKnow what happened?  They started slaughtering and decapitating people and Anon gave up.  ISIS would do the same and in fact would most definitely use it as propaganda to put more emphasis on the Sunni-Shia divide along with hate for the West and isolate the Sunni population in Syria and Iraq.\n\nISIS is not operating just as an angry blob.  If you pull something like that innocent civilians may very well get slaughtered and tortured.  Not to mention it could boost morale in ISIS\'s favor.  Strategically it\'s just not a good look.'
p1942
aS"Turkey and Saudi Arabia, the countries, have condemned ISIS extensively and even though it is conceivable that some elements within both countries support or are funding ISIS, it is kinda ridiculous to accuse without concrete proof that the governments of these countries are sleeping with the terrorists. If a country with one of the world's largest standing armies and a NATO member to boot (Turkey) and a staunch U.S. ally in the region (Saudi Arabia) were actively supporting ISIS, trust me, the world be a much different place. The fact of the matter is no country in the world, Muslim or Non-Muslim has recognized the legitimacy of the cult of Baghdadi and that is the support which I'm talking about. ISIS is absolutely isolated."

And that\'s how you get comments like \n\n\n&gt;Stop defending the indefensible. Islam has for all intents and purposes become the new Nazis. When Muslim groups denounce ISIS and Muslim countries start denouncing Islamic violence against Kafir, then maybe we can say Islam isn\'t dead set on murdering all "infidels". \nIn the meantime, Islamists and their savage supporters need to be wiped out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;Are ISIS targeting any Sunni Muslim groups?\n\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/11/03/world/meast/isis-mass-killing/'

There's criticism of the ideology and then there's bigotry against *people* for identifying with that ideology.  But, they're not the same.  I am quite happy to state that I dislike Islam.  However, it doesn't follow that I think that muslims should face discrimination on account of being followers of Islam.\n\n&gt;many people can't distinguish between a religion's written text and the actual followers of that religion.\n\nYou, for instance.\n\nYour link was interesting.  I'd have to look into it more closely, but it seems that they were executed for fighting against ISIS, which is interesting, but I don't think it disproves my claim that ISIS are engaged in sectarian violence."

p1946
aS"&gt; to say ISIS has nothing to do with Islam would be false in my opinion.\n\nI agree in a way, if you take it literal then yes it has everything to do with Islam. However Islam is being used as a excuse to justify and rally ppl for what they are doing. But they contradict them selfs with there deeds according to the religion they supposedly deffend, thus invalidating there core beliefs they project to the outside world meaning \nthat what they are deffending is a lie and has nothing to do with Islam.\n\n&gt;  Given that there are a lot of brown people in the western world, I highly doubt that most westerners think that.\n\nThen why is there so much hate twords them i could show you pictures and video's of western ppl harrasing them for just walking down the street, sitting on a bus etc,...\n\nThere are a lot islamophobic ppl more then you think or ppl think they understand what islam means but would then reffer to organisations like Isis or others "

aS"Russia is under extensive sanctions because of their role in Ukrainian violence and annexation of Crimea. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are not. So what does that tell you? You'll have me belief that not only is Turkey and Saudi Arabia supporting and funding ISIS, they're getting away with it because the U.S. and the rest of the world is either willingly turning a blind eye or not competent enough to catch them in the act? Or perhaps the west is complicit in supporting ISIS which would actually be a better explanation than them being incompetent? I don't know about you, but all of this sounds incredible far fetched.\n\nFact remains, again, ISIS is isolated and is not recognized by any country in the world.

Anyone *could* be pretending to hold any belief.  But unless there's some reason to think otherwise, we generally tend to accept people at their word when they claim to have a strong belief in something.\n\n&gt;My original point was that people discriminate solely based on religion.\n\nOK.

aS'1) It would be naive to assume every ISIS fighter walks around with a long ass beard and long hair with a short Islamic dress. These fighters move in and out of cities, carry out various covert operations around Iraq. \n\nThey hide in cities and commute secretly. Most ISIS fighters look like normal civilians, hence why it\'s difficult for army and government forces to crack down on these ISIS cells within cities. \n\nThe ones you see on propaganda videos are incredibly different to the ones on the ground. \n\n2) Again it is very childish to assume that there will be mass murder of sunni civilians on such a grand scale. Most of those anti-sunni atrocities occur in small operations in remote areas without the militia leadership knowing of them. They won\'t happen in large scales such as this. \n\nAs much as you wouldn\'t like to believe it but most of these militia leaders follow Sayed Al Al-Sistani who was very sincere in his fatwa against the in discriminant killing of anyone even ISIS members without fair trails. Sayed Al-Sistani was the man who gave the fatwa ordering Shias to: "...not call sunnis our brothers, call them our souls instead" \n\nI don\'t want you to think that I am denying that sunni civilian deaths occur. But they don\'t occur in an organised manner. A comparable situation would be the US army and Abu Ghraib prison, which undoubtably happened without the knowledge of American leadership. That\'s exactly the same with the Shia militias. Had the leadership known, I guarantee it would not have happened. '

They are lead by Bathist military officials that we put out of work. They are radicalized by the Sunnis we tortured in prisons like abu ghraib. And they are made up of those same Sunnis that we let get brutalized by Prime Minister al-Maliki who we put in power.

Turkey has both enabled and profited from the tremendous KRG economic boom by providing an outlet for Kurdish oil that does not go through Baghdad.  \n\nThe Turkish Kurds under the hardcore communist PKK have very, *very* little in common with the enthusiastically capitalist and oligarchic KRG anymore, and lumping all the Kurds in the region together is innaccurate.

And it doesn't change the fact that there's uncomfortably widespread support among worldwide Islam for at least some of ISIS's values.  \n\n&gt;Therefore Islam is not the CAUSE of ISIS.\n\nI don't know if it's possible to unambiguously demonstrate cause in cases like this.  Lots of things had to go wrong in order for ISIS to form.  However, without Islam, it's hard for me to think that we'd see anything like ISIS in its current form.

aS"Erdogan wants to reestablish the Sunni Ottoman caliphate and is taking Turkey away from secularism.  It helps to understand that secularism in the Middle East isn't the Western notion of secularism with tolerance for all and freedom of religion, it's authoritarian secularism where religion is banned from public influence and carefully constrained.  And yes, Turkey did and does support the Islamist rebels in Syria that are fighting against Assad. \n\nNot everything in the Middle East is Sunni vs Shia, but in general most conflicts line up that way.  The Shia power axis is led by Iran, with allies Hezbollah in Lebanon, Bashar Al-Assad in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen and now Iraq.  Mostly everyone else is majority Sunni.  The Kurds are a mix and have a different culture which is more Western in outlook, and have a long history of war/terrorism with Turkey.  They've made official peace with Turkey, but there's still a lot of enmity.\n\nIf you look at the geography, it goes like this:  Syria-held territory -- ISIS held territory -- Kurds -- Turkey.  By helping ISIS, Turkey hurts both the Kurds and Assad.  If ISIS manages to conquer Syria, either Turkey will have gotten rid of two enemies on its border and helped an ideologically-aligned friendly neighbor state arise, or if ISIS attacks Turkey, Turkey can call on NATO.

aS'Actually, I have a pretty good idea of what I\'m talking about. I think you misunderstood me though. I agree with you that the vast majority of muslims are nice, peaceful, law abiding people, though a disturbingly large percentage support suicide bombings or killing people who draw a picture of Mohammed or burn the koran. What I\'m saying is everything ISIS does is justified by the koran and hadith.\n\n\n&gt; No rape.\n\nYou\'re right, the Koran never uses the word rape, it\'s "your right hand possesses", ie your sex slaves. \n\nverse 4-24- Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess. Thus has Allah ordained for you. All others are lawful, provided you seek them from your property, desiring chastity, not fornication. So with those among them whom you have enjoyed, give them their required due, but if you agree mutually after the requirement (has been determined), there is no sin on you. Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.\n\n23:1-6The Believers must (eventually) win throughthose who humble themselves in their prayers; who avoid vain talk; who are active in deeds of charity; who abstain from sex, except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or whom their right hands possessfor (in their case) they are free from blame. \n\nsee also 70:22-30, 33:50 and from the hadith - "And, forbidden to you are, wedded women, those with spouses, that you should marry them before they have left their spouses, be they Muslim free women or not; save what your right hands own, of captured [slave] girls, whom you may have sexual intercourse with, even if they should have spouses among the enemy camp, but only after they have been absolved of the possibility of pregnancy [after the completion of one menstrual cycle]; this is what God has prescribed for you."\n\nBeheadings: verse 8:12  When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.\n\n&gt;No killing of innocent animals or unnecessary destruction of land.\n\nISIS justifies the destruction of ancient ruins and statutes because that is what Mohammed did when he destroyed all the statues in Mecca after conquering it. Not in the Koran but is in the Hadith.\n\n&gt;No killing or war period unless that person has taken up in arms to attack you or has taken up in ARMS against you due to your religion.\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of verses dealing with that. I\'m not going to post them all here.\n\n&gt;No killing or harming of women or children.\n\nBukhari (52:256) - The Prophet... was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)."  \n\nIt\'s perfectly ok to kill women and children if they aren\'t believers, from the mouth of Mohammed himself.\n\n\nAlso, your links saying muslims only account for 2.5% of terrorist attacks in the US leaves out the part where they make up less than 1% of the population, so they\'re still kind of punching above their weight.\n'

Many gangs have tried to infiltrate Western armies, though recruiting standards there kept many out. Still, gangsters in the US army for example are 100-500 times more represented than in the general population. ISIS has no recruiting standards. Welcome all comers. \n\nGood docu about gangs in US army https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7zoWcPeRmQ\n\nAnd you're right about the ennui being problematic. People look at the changes since the 1960s and think that's Western civilization. That's not western civilization. Porn, drugs, contemporary music, et cetera did not make the west great. That's the decline of Western civilization. The rise of Western civilization was a very disciplined, purposeful society, not a helter skelter. If I didn't know any better, if I didn't know the history of the West, the protestant reformation and the enlightenment, if I thought Western only meant being high on drugs, hardcore porn, hip hop or heavy metal, et cetera, I too would've rejected the West. \n\nThis is not a theoretical point. I've seen it here on reddit where some highly voted comment said that some western ISIS recruit who was a former rapper was the ultimate expression of the West. What bullshit. Gangster rap is not the ultimate expression of the West, it's the ultimate expression of the decline of the West. Yet such bullshit view is pervasive. \n"

These tribal based societies basically have every person getting involved in wars. If you look back to 1947 and 48, during the civil war in the British Mandate of Palestine, whole Arab villages would join in attacks against Jewish convoys going from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem all along the road.

aS"This is incorrect. 10% of Iran is Sunni and they are absolutely allowed to practice their religion. External observers often like to interpret anti-Balochi separatism or anti-MEK policies as being anti-Sunni because that fits into their narrative of sectarianism. Of course the treatment of Sunnis isn't perfect, but their persecution is vastly exaggerated.\n\nWhen Iran was invaded by Iraq, everyone was surprised that the Iranian Sunnis virtually all supported Iran and volunteered to fight Iraq in large numbers, but it wasn't surprising to Iranians who have a better idea of what internal relations are actually like. It's just like how people were surprised about Christian Lebanese supporting Hezbollah. Just like how people are shocked to read about the levels of intermarriage and good relations between Sunni and Shia in Baghdad. It's easy to exaggerate the sectarianism of all these groups. Sometimes both sides are not equally sectarianism. ISIS has no equivalent on the other side. "

I'm not saying I support Isreal, but if America stopped giving aid to them it would be turmoil in the Middle East. We would no longer have any control over Isreal and they would become more aggressive and war would be inevitable.  Tensions are pretty strong right now with Iran and ISIS.  We are already getting set to pull out of Afghanistan which everyone is shitting their pants about.  Afghanistan is optimistic but everyone else wondering when ISIS is going to take over after we leave.  \n\nSo it's basically pay money now or pay even more money when America has to step in on another war.  It cost less to take care of something than to rebuild it.  You can say that America shouldn't be involved at all but it is too late for that.

aS'&gt;I love how reddit users from the West talk like their countries are fighting against ISIS, when it is the exact opposite. ISIS is getting guns from proxy "moderate" rebels who are funded by the West. The country east of Iraq is actually fighting ISIS.\n\nThere is absolutely no evidence of this. The proxies you speak of are FSA brigades (1st Coastal, 13th Brigade and 101st Brigade in northern Syria) that receive TOW missiles. They support Jabhat al-Nusra (Al-Queda in Syria) not ISIS. The TOW missile program is retarded and I don\'t support it at all but there is no cooperation between these FSA groups except for defectors. ISIS is armed with Western equipment but it comes from aforementioned defectors but by and large it is Ghanima (spoils of war) picked up from retreating or dead soldiers.'

The Burqa represents the enslavement of women, a perverted sexuality and a destructive vision of the female body. I don\'t have to respect ideas that belong to the darkest of ages. This is not something "in my mind". It is an opinion shared by nearly everybody across the globe except some Muslims.\n\nThe fuck the Burqa causes zero harm. It is exactly the same ideology that brought us sharia patrols in Europe (very few cases) and ISIS jihadists (an unbelievable number of them). It is like saying that an old lady walking the streets with an SS armband is harmless. She might be, but the ideas she promotes are not. And she is fucking Nazi. Again, this is the prevalent opinion on the planet and that\'s why we have wide democratic support for debatable bans.\n\nTo ban the American flag, you need the votes for it.

(That attack that was totally not carried out by Assad and was definately by other rebels since they totally have the capability to produce and use them, even though oddly, they never did on such a scale after it almost got the west to remove Assad.) \n\nOnce it starts looking like the west actually has enough support to launch an invasion, Assad immediately agrees to some western demands to decrease the support.\n\n&gt;Not true!\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/revealed-the-oil-middleman-between-the-syrian-regime-and-isis-2015-3\n\n&gt;And who did isis release in Palmira if assad let them all go?!\n\nI didn't say he let them all go.\n\n[But he did let a lot of them go to stir up trouble.](http://www.thenational.ae/world/syria/assad-regime-set-free-extremists-from-prison-to-fire-up-trouble-during-peaceful-uprising) \n\n\n[In 2011, the majority of the current ISIS leadership was released from jail by Bashar Al Assad,](http://www.newsweek.com/how-syrias-assad-helped-forge-isis-255631)\n\nI doubt he thought they would pose this much of a threat in the long run, but then who in their right mind would believe that an army(Iraq) that had much larger numbers and much better equipment would run away and let ISIS pick up so many weapons and so much cash? But it all worked out since the support for western backed rebels is almost gone and everyone is joining together to help him crush the terrorist nation he helped create. Now, some people even see him as hero, battling western aggression and Islamic extremists...

However when either side, as ISIS did carries out terror attacks in the West then it's fine to hurt them &amp; try to weaken them. \n\nOf course one has to consider if attacking them just gives them more recruits/status. I mean they can't really kill enough people through terror to in any real way weaken western democracies. I mean, 9/11 killed 3,000 people and was horrible, but even if Al Qaeda or ISIS could kill 3,000 US civilians a year, that wouldn't weaken our country given our population size and economic and military power. \n\n\n\n"

Moses did the same with the golden calf when he came down from the mountain with the Ten Commandments. \n\nISIS is not doing this to stop idol worship. No one in that region even worships idols. They conquered a land of fellow Muslims who just don't agree with ISIS' extreme interpretation of the Quran. I can't speak for what ISIS' true intentions are... I'm a 25 year old Texas raised Muslim, but it's far more likely ISIS is using Mohammed's destruction of idols to justify their destruction of any culture of arts or artifacts that disagree with their final agenda. \n\nI know this sub is very anti-Muslim.

Stalin used the struggle to win WWII and the need to solidify Soviet Communism to satisfy his hunger for power and paranoia to defend it. Mussolini used Italian nationalist and unity currents to justify his action as Italy was a recently unified nation experiencing those feeling for the time. Finally, nearly every monarchy in Europe since the Middle Ages has claimed a divine right to rule. Whether they believe that or not is irrelevant.

aS"Who specifically are the weapons going to, though? The article just says that Syrian rebels are being armed. But this is nothing new. The UK and France were 'caught', earlier in the conflict arming Syrian rebels. The problem is, the entire Syrian rebellion is formed of splinter group. In the early days of the conflict, ISIS was part of that group but they weren't known as ISIS, merely as religious extremists. But the west has never had a problem in funding religious fanatics in proxy wars. Syria, after all, is merely a proxy war between the major super powers, each arming the side that is in their favor. \n\n\nOn the world stage, this is neither new nor surprising. The world super powers aren't going to punish other super powers for arming different factions for a number of reasons. Firstly, the west could be (probably is) arming the same factions 'secretly'. Secondly, these are clandestine proxy wars for a reason; major powers seek regional control without risking major conflict between each other. That way, they can maintain their own security while only sacrificing the security of those smaller nations caught in between, in this case Syria. Thirdly, and I'm not sure how strong a point this is, but if western countries openly and actively expose those details of the proxy war, then they will also risk exposing themselves. \n\n\nThe journalists will face serious jail time in the same way that other leakers in the US face serious jail time. No country wants their dirty secrets exposed. "

aS'Another pragmatic and very cynical view. \n\nISIS gives the West an easy target to fight against. Using conventional warfare to fight terrorist cells across the world is hard. Using conventional warfare to fight ISIS is much more straight forward.\n\nOther pros \n1. They are easily demonizable so politicians (and citizens) can get behind the fight against them in ways that are much easier than say - invading Iraq and ousting Saddam.\n2. They prolong the civil war in Syria - which makes life hard on Assad and increases the chances of a government change there at some point. (Obviously, the main reason why Turkey and SA are helping to fund them).\n3. Other than Syria, they are mostly contained in Iraq which the West can use as leverage to maintain influence there by helping to liberate areas.\n3. They are "uniting" most of the middle east Western allies against them. Aside from obviously Turkey and SA. But its not like Turkey and SA care about how successful ISIS is, as long as it keeps Syria off balance and allows them to increase their influence in the area.\n4. Many terrorist recruits are often hard to track and figure out what they are up to. If they all just head to ISIS and fight in their army, they are easy to keep track of (and easier to kill).'

aS"I seriously doubt your claim that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are all funding ISIS. Saudi Arabia and Qatar/Turkey are going through a proxy tug of war for power in the middle east. Funding the same group in no way supports both of their goals, since ISIS has shown to be quite independent and spontaneous in their actions. No government would be able to 'rein them in' so to speak.\n\nNow unless you are talking about private Saudi, Qatari and Turkish citizens instead of the governments funding ISIS, I find it extremely difficult to believe what you're saying without some source on it.

aS"The Turkish government, along with other regional Sunni governments, is supplying rebels in Syria fighting the Assad regime with the full albeit tacit/covert (in light of bad publicity from ISIS) support of NATO.\n\nFor obvious reasons, they cannot admit this.\n\nFor reasons of common sense, they are obviously not supplying ISIS themselves. Not least of which is that ISIS has declared their intention to eventually fight and conquer Turkey. Not to mention their regional allies (from Saudi-Arabia and other Gulf states to NATO) are anti-ISIS.\n\nIn related news, the non-ISIS Sunni rebels just took over a province in the northwest of Syria bordering Turkey. Coincidence?\n\nAlso, it's no secret that from Turkey's perspective ISIS is a problem that could be dealt with after Assad's regime is gone.\n\nThe hysteria has no place here. \n\nIt's like a bunch of Turkish teenagers lurk on Reddit ready at a moment's notice to go crazy with every bit of news on Turkey."

Why focus on the specific holy text if any will do? In the end, people will read into their religious texts what they want to. \n\nThe problem is then not a religious one, but political.

That would have to be a post-Assad re-constitution of the state, with real assurances for first-class citizenship for all communities -- Sunni, Shia-Alawite, Christian, Kurd, etc.  Iran would have to play a major role in easing Assad and his clique out.

Either it does good things that wouldn\'t happen anyways, or it doesn\'t do good things. \n\n&gt;Very good, you\'ve managed to find a couple groups that committed atrocities even though they weren\'t religious. \n\nNo, I\'m taking your example where you claim, and I quote "when somebody does something like strap a bomb to their chest and blow up a market full of innocent people, there\'s absolutely no reason to think they would ever do anything like that if they didn\'t believe they would be rewarded for it in the afterlife.." and showing why it\'s absolutely ignorant and wrong. \n\n&gt;unlike ISIS and Christians during the Crusades, the Khmer Rouge and Tamil Tigers were not motivated by their lack of religion. Rather, they saw religion as competition against their own dogmas, so they suppressed religion (as you yourself point out, the Tigers espoused a Marxist-Leninist ideology, which was just another kind of dogma - the fact that they happened to be atheist was completely irrelevant).\n\nAgain, totally wrong - if you\'re going to pretend their being atheist doesn\'t matter, and their motivations were based on unrelated ideological concerns (whatever those might be), you have to admit the same thing for every other group as well. ISIS is concerned with temporal power and cares about suppressing other religions and competing ideologies, same as Crusaders, same as the Khmer Rouge and everyone else. \n\nYour logic simply doesn\'t work, you\'re wrong on the facts and your arguments completely fail to understand the scenarios you\'re talking about.'

aS'&gt; The underlying ideas of Islam are exactly what ISIS is fighting for. \n\nPower is what they\'re fighting for - Islam is their rallying flag.

It is as much of a motivator as the lack of belief in fairies, or the lack of belief in Bigfoot, or the lack of the belief that there is currently a teapot in orbit around Saturn. Ascribing any other meaning to atheism than that is necessarily specious.\n'

aS'&gt;You repeatedly make exactly that claim; you said the "good" religious people do are only things they would have done anyways. Either you\'re denying religion leads to anything good, or you\'re incapable of sorting thoughts logically.\n\nReligion is used for good. However, in the absence of religion, people would still have plenty of reasons to do good. I\'ve said this already, and it\'s not contradictory in the slightest. Maybe an analogy will help: I sometimes eat pizza because it\'s hot, it has cheese, and it has pepperoni. But sometimes, I eat pizza even though it\'s not hot because I like cheese and pepperoni. That doesn\'t mean that I don\'t sometimes eat pizza because it\'s hot.\n\n&gt;I literally just showed you the history of the practice, which originated with marxist groups, not anyone religious. Are you incapable of reading things in front of your face?\n\nYou literally showed me no such thing. Nothing of the sort appears in your posts. \n\nEven if it did, the motivations of the group it originated with don\'t necessarily have any relation whatsoever to the motivations of the groups that use it now, just as the motivation to use a plane as a bomber has no relation to the original intent to use planes for transportation.\n\n&gt;So when people who belong to the group you claim membership in do something, they\'re "wackos" and not representative\n\nIf someone of your race, or your gender, or your nationality killed people for no reason, would it say something about that race, gender, or nationality? Or would you think that maybe there was something wrong with that person and that it didn\'t reflect on you at all?\n\n&gt;but when wackos from another group make a claim, suddenly they have the authority to represent billions of people who disagree with them and hate everything they represent.\n\nISIS doesn\'t claim to represent anyone but ISIS. Whether you think they represent Islam or not is up to you, but you have just as much authority as they or anyone else to say whether they represent Islam.\n'
p2184
aS'&gt;And the fact that multiple people make that claim and nobody standing outside can actually say ISIS is right means that by definition, they must be wrong.\n\nWhy must they be wrong? Maybe they\'re the only ones who are right. They have literally as much right to claim to represent Islam as anyone else who practices Islam. In fact, they might have even *more* of a right to claim that title since they take the Koran literally instead of interpreting it to make it fit in better with modern society. In a very real sense, the version if Islam practiced by ISIS is the most pure, true form of Islam\n\n&gt;You\'ve repeatedly made the claim that eliminating religion is an improvement, putting "lack of religion" ahead of "presence of religion" - you can pretend that\'s not making a claim about the preferability of a lack of religion, but you\'re only fooling yourself.\n\nYou said that I claimed everything about atheism is good, which is not what I said and is not what I believe. Atheism has it\'s drawbacks, they just don\'t outweigh its advantages.\n\n&gt;Actually, no, that isn\'t how religions automatically think. Some members of some religions might think that, same as some atheists take on an "us vs them" attitude, and neither one is the slightest bit superior to the other.\n\nAll current major world religions have a text which requires adherents to hold certain beliefs. A person can choose not to believe those things, but then they\'re not truly adherents of that religion. Atheists have no such requirement since, again, it\'s just a lack of belief.\n\n\n'

aS'When Mecca was conquered, the pagan idols were destroyed and hence the means to practice paganism. No religions but Islam, Christianity, and Judaism were tolerated. This is well established and I could cite a dozen respected scholars on this point, e.g., Robert Hoyland, Fred Donner, David Cook, G. R. Hawting, Reuven Firestone, Bernard Lewis, Hugh Kennedy, etc. Patricia Crone, who knows the field of Islamic studies much better than I do, [sums up](https://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-europe_islam/jihad_4579.jsp) the consensus this way (emphasis mine): \n&gt;The scholars said that all infidels had to be brought under Muslim sovereignty, but that Jews and Christians acknowledged the true God and had a revelation from him, so they could be allowed to exist under Muslim protection in return for paying poll-tax. *All other infidels were pagans, so how were they to be treated? There is general agreement that the Arabs of Mohammed\'s Arabia got the choice between Islam and the sword, and that they did so because they had no religion, as one early scholar put it. (Paganism didn\'t count as one.)*\n\nI\'m glad you admit the Apostasy Wars were fought because of...apostasy. Sadly, it seems that in your mind the violence was justified because the tribes had "weak" faith, i.e., they weren\'t Muslim enough. Isn\'t that how ISIS justifies their atrocities? '

It has absolutely nothing to do with religion \n\nYour assertion that religion is the reason for suicide bombing is objectively false.

I am not entirely convinced from the article that the weapons are indeed going to isis, they are just crossing the border. There is also the FSA and Al nusra etc operating in Syria. I cannot find a rational motive for piping weapons to ISIS for Turkey outside of appeasing the beast at the doorstep, or an irrational hatred of the kurds.\n\nBut yeah, like I said, countries tend to act in their own interests. Last May, when the crimea thing was popping off, Turkey threatened to close the bosporus to russian ships, so it seemed as if they were acting in the interest of nato then.

So they consider so called "moderates" (which are majority of other Muslims) infidels, and try to kill them too.\n\nIn reality ISIS is right. They do truly represent Islam.

How is that productive?  How does this work towards our goal of weakening ISIS and bringing stability to the area?  We\'re passing the buck of dealing with our own criminals to places that can\'t.  What if he\'s a Canadian-British dual national?  Canadian-American?  Why should we dump our problems on our allies doorsteps? And if our allies shouldn\'t be expected to deal with these people, then why should anyone else, ally or not?\n\n\nIt\'s irresponsible and reckless.  These people should be imprisoned for life on Canadian soil, far away from the power-base of terrorist groups that can and do successfully stage jailbreaks.  Canada has a responsibility to hold its citizens to account for the crimes they commit, here and abroad.  Revoking their citizenship is simply saying "not our problem."

Maybe they\'re tired of war. \n\n&gt;  Isnt there anything the West can do?\n\n"As it turns out" the The Telegraph strategy is absurd. Boko Haram is currently unleashing suicide bombers. By that metric, the war in Afghanistan is a success.\n\nThe other option is we can stop giving terrorists a reason to interpret jihad in a violent way. Instead, obey international law. \n\n* Stop participating in the terrorist global war which generates a global response. This includes tolerating countries that carry out fair, democratic elections like Egypt and Palestine. It also means cutting back on our military forces. We are inviting our own terror because we have the ability to dominate the negotiating table with force.\n* Get rid of the "center of gravity" approach. This means not bombing highways and civilian institutions, which will allow popular organizations to take root. Successful peace movements often involve women and labor unions.\n\n'

Trying to will only get civilians killed and make you look bad. Well what do they say now? Oh that\'s right most the leadership that was talking then are dead. \n\nIs it fucked up places like Iraq and Afghanistan have to rebuild their countries, sure. However, like I said with Nazi Germany, they let this happen by not keeping there own mental ill and evil ideologies in check. In fact quite the opposite they funded, trained, armed, mobilized, and then hid them. Is this the innocent people\'s fault no not  a lot of them at least not directly, but it was the leaderships fault. So what you are asking Americans to do is stay out of these countries, however that would require we let our enemies grow and mature in ways that would allow them to threaten us. Again sorry you might be brain washed to allow such things to happen among you or even hoping that they succeed. However we are free, free to think for ourselves, and free to defend ourselves. What don\'t you understand, no terrorist cell that threatens America will survive. If those cells are hiding among you (and you know if they are, grown men know what\'s going on around them and their homes) then guess what maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually the Americans will come and they will destroy them. Either kick them out of your community, leave or die with them. However don\'t blame us because they exist among you. \n\nHow thick can you be to think the defense of "we surrounded ourselves with civilians now you can\'t touch us" would actually work? Hey that sucks for the civilians, which are actually hostages, but that doesn\'t mean we can just let them continue. So is it their fault for living there? You keep making this same argument. Yes, its there fault for living there AND allowing Islamic radicalism to spread and grow to the point of threating other sovereign nations. This isn\'t the Quran you don\'t have the blessing of almighty God to destroy "the great evil" that is America. Jihad is just cold blooded murder, period. Terrorism is cold blooded murder, period. If you can not only practice your religion peacefully, BUT stop your own countrymen from killing innocent people that don\'t want anything to do with your religion then yes it is your fault.\n\nWhat makes you think that we would let blowing up our towers and bombing peaceful sporting events , bombing subways and killing cartoonist in France, or the terror attacks on Great Brittan just slide with no repercussions? The terrorist are not even this gullible so why are the middle eastern people?\n\nThat statement is the most racist statement you have seen in a long time?\n\nHow is the truth of sharia law racist? This is the ugly truth were all people are not treated equally, where all this paid for education and free medical care you speak of is bullshit. This is were innocent people or people with misdemeanor offences are murdered publicly for the ohhs and ahhhs of the blood crazed fanatics of a diabolical religion which rule. If you are proud of that and me calling it evil and stone aged offends you, good. Call me a racist all you want but Islamic is not a race. It is the biggest problem in the world today and not just America, but the whole world is tired of dealing with your bullshit. How the fuck can you sleep at night defending such actions?\n\nSo your morale comparison is Saddam Hussein, I thought a country lie the US or France had a higher morale ground based on hundreds of year of laws.\n\nWait so first I was racist for calling these men\'s actions evil, yet now we are a piece of shit because "our morale comparison" is people like Hussein and Gadhafi (the man with the plan for peace love, education and free medical care for all.....)? Well which is it? \n\nSee that\'s the problem you think you can have it both ways, be the lion that kills the forces of "evil" and the poor helpless starving innocent people that just want America to stop bombing their orphanages. You can not have it both ways. You want Americans out then tell your leadership to stop fucking with us or get a gun and join them in trying to force us out. Those are your options.\n\nYour people are a joke your social system is a joke, your laws are a joke, your religion is a joke, your military and governments are jokes and the best thing that happen for you countries in the last 50 years is American flags flying over your skies. \n\nNow after all the unfortunate but yet necessary blood has been spilt these places are finally starting to come back together in diplomatic fashion were people can vote for their leadership with a voice. Are all these places running a smooth diplomatic system, no because corruption is everywhere. However, it\'s ingrained in your society were peaceful exchanges of power are very very far and in between. We gave you a chance for a better existence and to join the modern world, what you do with it is up to you. Now should terrorist cells like the new ISIS starting making camp in your back yard again then guess who\'s coming....agian? DONT LET IT HAPPEN! Why is that so complicated for you?\n\nEdit: Most of these countries were on the brink of civil war or already deep in the midst of it. Hussein was tried by a court of his own peers and countrymen and hung by the neck by his own people. Gadhafi was drug through the streets and fucked with a knife in his ass until he died, again by his own people. Now why would their own people do such a thing to these great Islamic leaders?\n\nFuck it I feel like going further. Lets talk Syria and Bashar al-Assad. This was yet another nation already in the midst of civil war which terrorist cells know is a land of milk and honey for them, where they can grow in number and slowly yet surely increase in supplies and armaments. The rebels are taking cities, the governments forces can hardly hold their ground with many defecting daily. These groups know they can pull at your religious strings because unlike them you fear God. Then as they grow in number and spirit they move out to claim portions of a fucking sovereign nation, while at civil war still a sovereign nation, like buzzards coming for road kill. Then the government in a dire attempt to gain some fear commit chemical warfare on its own people. See that\'s where they (Syrian government) fucked up, we were watching it and coordinating to try and keep these terror cells from literally conquering Syria village by village. So now you fucked up and broke not only a UN law but the international court on war crimes law as well. Like what the fuck do the think happens next? If it didn\'t then things like the USA, UN, and IWC court are fucking fake and well they are not. We mean it when we say sovereign countries or not you can\'t mass murder women and children. Period. Anybody that is not a psycho, mentally ill, or just plain evil would never disagree.\n\nThen there\'s people like you.\n'

I really think ISIS is created by western civilizations, because in Turkey we didn't have high radical-islamic population (except Hizbullah, they killed some authors, important people in between 1980-1998) \n\nI guess our current president (was also ex-leader of AKP) and government (AKP) wants more islamic country.

There is no doubt that a decade of violence, invasions and war has lead to this rise of extremism, ISIS emerged from US prisons in Iraq. \n\nThere are many places that are heavily Muslim where there is not conditions even comparable to those in Iraq and Syria.

They seem like they generally are nice but I still think they believe a bunch of non sense like that a well in the temple cured all illness and so on.  \nI'm under the impression that you can't actually believe or not believe in something until you at least learn what it's about. A lot of Christians and Muslims never really learn about the other religion and therefore in my mind they are believing only based on the fact that they are told to or were born in a certain area. That's not believing it's following. Its always the best argument against religion that without doubt most people of either religion would believe the other religion if born in the other countries. ISIS members would be devout Christians of born in the US to Christian parents. Radical Christians would be ISIS members if born in Syria. "

You either assimilate into the Pashtun culture if you are arab you go back home.\n\nThe way ISIS operates will not work in the tribal belt. They have to change their tactics but they also need a base of operations that as we currently speak is being constantly bombarded by the Pakistan military. Their also need a support base before that and the only signs they have shown of this is allegiances with smaller taliban factions. They have little to no presence outside of this in the region.\n\nThe type of radical Islam ISIS uses doesn't work in Pakistan / Afghanistan or the sub - continent.\n\nYes the religion is Islam... but not all Islamic countries are the same because culture and tradition plays a huge role and affects religion as well. Sub - continent culture is very very different from Middle - Eastern / Arabic culture. The way people think and behave is different.\n\nISIS would first need to establish a presence in the region before they even think about trying to gain access to nuclear weapons. If it was that easy why hasn't the TTP done it, which had at one point brought together all the smaller factions and was an actual legitimate threat, and was carrying out planned, strategic attacks on high loss facilities like military basis, airports, air bases, prisons holding radical islamists etc. The TTP has been broken apart and shredded by the Pakistani army and all that is left now are factions operating independently with little to no communication or planning. Going after soft targets (public places) and there has been a huge huge decrease in those as well (look at year over year terror attacks in public places) as well no attacks against key critical facilities.\n\nIndians are not dumb they are some of the smartest people in the world.

If you go with Taliban or TTP or any variants your theory becomes more plausible because they actually have a presence in the region.

If you notice there has even been a sharp decrease in the kashmiri radicals they used to send to Indian side of the LOC. \n\nThat being said ISIS ideology conflicts with sub-continent culture. They cannot form cells or have a presence. The way ISIS operates is by aligning itself with smaller taliban factions. They provide no operational or logistical support or have any say on how they conduct themselves. They simply have verbal agreements that we are now aligned together, like me giving someone the right to use my company name but don't do much else other then that. That is how ISIS operates in Pakistan currently under the guise of taliban factions. But in terms of having an actual presence they don't have one. \n\nYou can google certain groups giving their allegiance to ISIS but their funding and operational effectiveness remains the same.

Going into Iraq destabilized it. How many deaths have happened in Iraq since our invasion? Has the number hit 2 million people yet? Would Saddam have killed near as many? Would ISIS have had any shot of going into Iraq if Saddam was still in power? Would the U.S. lost as much global goodwill if we had stayed out of it? For all you have to say about Iran, they're the ones fighting ISIS today. Obviously it's for their selfish reasons, but that's a different story. Honestly, do you think Iraq is better off today than it was under Saddam?\n\n&gt;As for how I know that no more people died in that bunker is that the bunker no longer exists. \n\nSure, it's impossible to build another bunker. Our stupid congresscritters now want another 10k troops on the ground. How do you know they don't need to visit the area where that bunker was? I'm actually amazed at how stupid that 10k troop idea is. We had 100k+ troops there and there were tons of deaths from the infighting. But somehow 10k troops today will make a difference. I'd bet that whoever is suggesting it is taking huge donations from the weapons manufacturers.\n\n&gt;Like I said you do need defense but will not admit it and you ignore anything that does not support your fantasy.\n\nI'll reiterate. I try to respond to every sentence you say, so you don't accuse me of that. Show me what I'm missing. We don't need defense, nobody is planning a broad scale invasion of the U.S. And don't think it's because we have some huge military, it's because the idea is so stupid.

These people have been fighting since recorded history against each other, against foreign invaders like Alexander / Genghis Khan etc. etc. Their culture and way of life remains. \n\nISIS propaganda doesn't work. The cold war should be the perfect example. Arabs flocked to Afghanistan to fight against the Soviet and after the war you can see what happened. Arabs couldn't influence the taliban and afghan way of life, they assimilated into it.

aS'One would think you could just strap on a bomb and kill yourself if you really really desperately wanted to do so. Especially if you are an ISIS member already. \n\nTIL: no, waiting list and connections. '
p2287
aS'Most of the DoD budget is spent preparing for the next inevitable war.... Antarctica.... The Penguins march at dawn. However, ISIS has more then 30,000 members and is estimated at roughly 50k - 110k and rising due to their success.\n\n'
p2288
aS"Nonsense, ISIS isn't only against  Bashar al Assad, they enslave Yazidis without any such justification. If ISIS was only against Assad, and they wouldn't oppress local population with they fundamentalist ideology then we would be talking about completely different group that could be justified in they actions."
p2289
aS"Didn't mean Muslims in general. Sorry about that. I meant the local terror groups (eg Boko Haram in Africa) pledging allegiance to ISIS. ISIS is different in a way that Baghdadi calls himself the Pope-equivalent Caliph while OBL or Zawahiri never called themselves that. There might be radicals who think its blasphemous to not support the Caliph. \n\nThese are ISIS related reports just this week in India:\n\nhttp://www.dailypioneer.com/nation/busted-isis-module-in-ratlam-was-targeting-rss-bjp-leaders.html\n\nhttp://timesofindia.com/city/lucknow/Indian-Muslims-dont-support-ISIS-Rajnath/articleshow/47409876.cms\n\nhttp://ndtv.com/andhra-pradesh-news/four-hyderabad-men-questioned-by-police-about-isis-plans-reports-767021\n\nIf the Home Minister needs to talk about ISIS, that means its definitely a cause of concern. Compared to ISIS news there's hardly any news on Al Qaeda in India. Like Britain, India is also seeing many people joining ISIS. The presence of terror modules indicate some local groups are turning to ISIS\n\nI don't see how Indian and Bangladeshi muslims have anything to do with Taliban though."
p2290
aS"Sounds like more fearmongering.\n\nOk, so ISIS manages to take over the whole of Pakistan, the rest of Pakistan's allies (China, US) stand by idly and do nothing. ISIS gets to the nuclear facility and then what? Launching a nuclear weapon is not like firing an AK-47, you have to have people who know what they are doing, which I highly doubt that ISIS has. "
p2291
aS'the only way to truly wipe out ISIS is to completely annihilate whoever is funding, training, and arming ISIS. '
p2292
aS"So it's not bad when ISIS does it to enemy soldiers, even if they are prisoners, k."
p2293
aS"But its not radical thats the thing, they are just following their religion the way its meant to be followed. All the other muslims aren't following their religion correctly, they are picking and choosing a lot more than what ISIS is."
p2294
aS'As an Indian, I agree with /u/Evilbunz. ISIS is a bit too radical and disciplined and does not really fit with the Pakistani brand of terrorism / insurgency (sorry!) - which is more "linear" in its approach vs. a much more radical we-want-it-all approach. Pakistani Army / ISI and politicians are just kinda selfish and use terrorism as a tactical tool for advancing their interest. They will never have the balls or motivation to support crazies who are beheading people to create a pure regime. '
p2295
aS'I think you\'re specifically referring to ISIS creating a corrupted version of Islam, but in case this is an asinine attempt to wave away every religion on planet earth as "made up shit you can have any way you want" I have to take issue. Not because I\'m religious, but because if you oversimplify religion you\'re working with a completely useless and harmful (to yourself, honestly) framework to view religious people and the world in general.\n\nThe vast majority of religious institutions do not let you "have it any way you want" . They are actually pretty damn stringent about their belief systems. Why do you think Shia and Sunnis have been fighting for hundreds of years? It\'s not because each side can "have it any way they want". On the contrary, they CAN\'T have it any way but theirs.\n\nAnd even the moderate Christians in the USA have a belief system that ultimately falls back on the bible and the teachings of Jesus. You can try to say "it\'s made up and they just interpret it how they want" but you may as well be saying that about the constitution of the United states. IF you honestly believe that western Christians would happily change their belief systems to include violent suicide then you are pretty out of touch with religious folks in this country.\n\nI don\'t think religion is "made up shit" and I don\'t think the reason ISIS is so willing to commit these horrible atrocities has to do with them "making up shit" either. Sadly, they are actually acting on an extremely stringent religious system that comes directly from the quran and has been around for thousands of years in different forms - most recenty Wahabist islam.\n\n\n\n'
p2296
aS'Isis is the true definition what religious fanaticism and.A lack of education does to someone.How can they used CHILDREN as suicide bombers ISIS have no soul.Poor kids.'
p2297
aS'Do you think the outlook is really that bleak? It seems that while the popularity of islamism never really changes, the percentage of islamists with a jihadi or salafi disposition rises and falls. \n \nISIS are just land-grabbers. Wherever a Government has too little power, authority or popular support, they will move in. Moderates and non-Sunnis will flee the area while the salafists will stay. They might brag about victories and destroy the lives of those that get caught in the crossfire, but might the net result not be a redrawn map which allows peace in the Middle East to be more imaginable?'
p2298
aS'Article is just speculation by India. Even the Pakistanis would be not so stupid to let ISIS have nuclear bomb.'
p2299
aS'ISIS is racist?! '
p2300
aS"And you know, it couldn't happen to a more deserving bunch. I'd like to see the whole ISIS thing come down to terrorism throughout Saudi Arabia. They started this shit, I'd like to see them eaten by their own monster. As I said, it couldn't happen to a more deserving bunch of folks."
p2301
aS'I\'m actually curious what that means, and what islamic sect is doing this.\n\nDuring the debate around ISIS I actually realized that Sunni scholars never outright condemned the methods ISIS uses, but only rejected the reasoning for the war and their bad treatment for non-violent Sunni muslims. So if a muslim actually agrees with a reason for war, in the end he would have to agree with the violence and atrocities ISIS and JAN commit, as far as I\'ve understood their arguments.\n\nSo if you want to teach moderate Islam, without doubting Mohammeds mehtods and changing the Quran, they probably will try to find some interpretation of the Quran that you don\'t have a reason to go at war at all. In case of Civil law I\'m not sure how to apply "moderate" Islam and what that would mean.'
p2302
aS'&gt;Because wahhabism is the problem\n\nMost ISIS fighters are Tunisian not Saudis...why?\n\n'
p2303
aS"Yes... degrade which is what we are doing as per Gen. Welsh USAF mission. Eventually destroy ISIL refers to the second part of what I have been saying all along... destroy via an indigenous ground force that we will support. No one expects air strikes to destroy a group that holds territory without massive casualties. Your own link even backs up exactly what I have been saying this whole time.\n\nPlease tell me how the situation has massively deteriorated since Kobane. Ramadi has always been an insurgent strong hold and was only taken by the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen. It is no surprise the Iraqi forces weren't able to hold it. The Peshmerga and Shia militias have been reclaiming more territory than ISIS is trying to take. \n\nI am still unsure of what you are arguing. Do you truly believe if the US wanted to it couldn't send in a ground force and completely annihilate ISIS? ISIS can barely fight the Peshmerga, let alone the strongest military this world has ever seen. If you argue that point then I highly doubt your claim of working for any geopolitical think tanks or whatever you claimed to do for a living."
p2304
aS'Getting killed at battle is not a less noble way to die according to Islam.\n\nStupid ISIS. Martyrdom is martyrdom in the eyes of Islam.'
p2305
aS"Well ISIS isn't necessarily afraid of suicide, I hold the Pakistani government in a slightly better light."
p2306
aS'As someone who had to operate one of those damn things in a mounted unit, trust me. ISIS is worse off having to deal with them.'
p2307
aS"Do you want more ISIS recruits? Because that's how you get more ISIS recruits."
p2308
aS"Eh, if they were regular criminals who were arrested for stealing a loaf of bread, or even somewhat violent criminals, sure.\n\nThese are military members of a religious death-cult that believe their dying will be rewarded.  They aren't looking to die to escape suffering, but because they believe they will be made in to God's chosen people in the after-life.  On top of that, let's not kid ourselves: These groups are very savvy propagandists.  Al'Qaeda didn't merely become infamous because of their deeds, but because of their recruitment/propaganda.  ISIS has followed similarly so, with slickly produced videos, entire PR departments extolling the chance to die for God's glory online, etc."
p2309
aS'Why not? I mean we created the conditions under which ISIS was able to become what it is today. Iraq has become an ouroboros for the U.S. Still amazes me that this shitty country has some how compelled every president for 25 years to bomb it. '
p2310
aS'ISIS siezes 2,300 Humvee armored vehicles as they overrun the Iraqi security forces.\nFTFY'
p2311
aS'Unfortunately, this is good news for the US. ISIS is a CIA and Israeli creation. They want a Sunni buffer zone against Iranian influence.'
p2312
aS"It is, but it's not that far fetched. Look at what ISIS is currently doing, for example."
p2313
aS"No worries. ISIS isn't going to check the oil and fire extinguisher every week. The vehicle can't operate unless we pmcs every week. Plus, as soon as a headlight goes out it's deadlined. "
p2314
aS"A child bomber approaches Iraqi forces. If they don't shoot him, they will all die. If they do shoot him, ISIS has propaganda material claiming that Shias are murdering Sunni children. \n\n\n\n"
p2315
aS'[says here 50%](http://www.aawsat.net/2015/05/article55343744/moscow-changing-tack-on-relationship-with-assad-sources)\n\nBut read somewhere else ISIS holds a lot of just desert.'
p2316
aS'Iraq has an incompetent government that for the past few years has been an almost fascist Shia government. It does. It begin or end with the "Army".\n\n1. Shias dont feel loyalty due the government incompetence and corruption.\n\n2. Sunnis were outcasts to begin with - the few Sunnis left in the Army are conflicted as they see and fight alongside foreign Shia rebel groups  doing the exact same as what ISIS are being accused of doing.\n\n\n'
p2317
aS"ITT: people don't understand the difference between fundamental Islam and extremists. ISIS are fundamentalists. "
