&gt; The announcements ranged from the ability to run Android and iOS apps on Windows 10, to a free development environment for Windows, Mac, and Linux, to Continuum - a feature that will leverage Universal Apps to allow your phone to adapt to a desktop Windows 10 experience when connected to a monitor.

&gt; First, Microsoft is opening its Windows platform up beyond traditional Windows apps to iOS and Android apps.

&gt; With the release of a free development environment that spans Windows, Linux, and Mac, Microsoft is recognizing that developers have a wide preference of systems they work on and Microsoft is prepared to support those systems.

&gt; Internally, some Microsoft employees refer to Windows 10 as &amp;quot;The last Windows.&amp;quot; Based on the company&amp;#039;s strategy of perpetual Windows builds, the concept of a single, fixed &amp;quot;Release date&amp;quot; seems less and less important.

&gt; According to Belfiore, Microsoft&amp;#039;s goal with Windows is to keep evolving: &amp;quot;Adjust dynamically to the real world and to real people, and sometimes that&amp;#039;s subjective feedback, and sometimes it&amp;#039;s quantitative analysis, on how we build Windows, how we deploy it.""

&gt; At Build, executives said on stage that Windows will be a free upgrade &amp;quot;For the first year&amp;quot; for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users, which implies you&amp;#039;ll be paying for these features at some point.

This data is publicly available on the internet, so not a great risk from an information sensitivity perspective.  I believe it is an XWindows app, so that it can be opened on a variety of clients in the event of workstation failure.

The PC is most likely a display-only workstation with a local account.  The problem is that the workstation would need to be connected to the corporate WAN in order to display the information.  This in itself presents a security issue: the corporate network can be accessed from a PC via a local account for which the password has been displayed on national TV.  No, the Windows domain could not be accessed, but the network layer and other systems and devices on the network could.

A hacker who has penetrated the network could then exploit this information by attempting to log into each and every IP address on the WAN using the name and password which was revealed on TV.    (Heck, a malicious cleaner could also do the same.  $20 paid to cleaner for every username/password sticky that has been successfully photographed during their nighttime cleaning shift.)  Eventually said hacker could get lucky.  The PC is clearly still running WinXP as can be determined by the colour scheme and the max/min/close icons on the upper right-hand corner of the application window.  WinXP exploits could be leveraged, or a key logger could be installed in effort to capture a valid Windows domain username/password at some future point.

21,"They really aren't that similar. Everything about material design is supposed to make you feel like you are directly manipulating physical objects and make it easy to immediately see the effects of your actions. This is like the philosophy of classic windows taken to the extreme. ""Objects"" in MD reflect light and cast shadows. They can be stacked and affixed to one another, but they can't pass through each other.

Metro moves away from the classic window manipulation and flattens everything out. It's apparently inspired by transportation signage and places high importance on typography. It prefers to have all of it's information on a single pane. Notably, they also carried a few small visual design changes over to classic Windows, like the removal of drop shadows.

One of the easiest places to see the difference in design philosophy should be the app switcher. Windows 8 Metro has a pane slide out that displays the apps in a flat column, while Material Design has you flip through the apps like a deck of cards.

Also, I can't speak for iOS, but those design elements you listed already existed within Holo (lack of gradiants to a lesser degree) which was released before Windows 8.

24,"As a developer and a platform-agnostic, I think I can offer some insight here.

Primarily, the things that people who would ever say ""Macs are easier"" in the first place, the things they are looking for aren't remotely similar to the things that you and I look for in a computer. They want simplicity and lack of options. The 'simplicity' aspect has a lot to do with the fact that Mac doesn't really prompt you with dialog boxes and complicated installer menus etc. Lots of the system settings are locked away and impossible to accidentally switch on.

To defend it a bit as an actual developer: I do like working on Mac. Spaces is pretty cool (although granted many Windows applications replicate this). Drivers are almost never an issue on mac. Compatibility is basically never an issue unless there flat out is not a mac version of the program in question. And the battery life on my macbook pro. Holy god. I've had it closed (not off) for a week before and came back to find it at 99% battery. I've never seen a windows laptop come even close to this. It also stretches the battery longer as far as uptime is concerned while also being a reasonably thin laptop.

And the industrial design. I've heard people argue back and forth about this one but I still have never seen a laptop with physical design as nice as the macbook. From the magclip power cord, to the keyboard which is probably the nicest, smoothest, non-stickiest keyboard I've used apart from mechanicals, to the hinge that has just the right amount of friction not to flap open on its own, but not so much that you have to hold the base down when you open it. The trackpad is amazing as well and that might not sound like a big deal but when you're moving around all day and need to get bits of work done it is a life saver. It's good enough that I hardly bother with a mouse anymore when I'm doing work. The thing is expertly designed.

On the flipside you have things that just irritate the fucking hell out of me about apple. Lack of cut and paste in finder (what the actual fuck), Apple's marriage to hieroglyphics instead of helpful words for menus. I mean, take a look around mac OS. There is just a stupid amount of iconography that makes no sense. The finder menus, itunes, really every aspect of the platform. And don't even get me started on the icons in xcode. Also the fact that it takes 12 more steps to do anything technical than it does on windows. Take a look at how to show hidden files on mac. Here's a hint: it requires the command line.

Yeah I'm agnostic. I hate both equally. But I definitely see the merits of Apple's products. It *definitely* is not simply a case of people paying more because they have been duped into thinking it's better.

FWIW I prefer windows if everything else is equal, but Mac definitely has its benefits and it does some things much better than PCs do.",1,0.0207685455134,0.261192025201,0.500927275672,0.323630538992,1.16666666667,1.0,542,0.0335570469799,15.9411764706,0.366666666667,0.716666666667

44,"The difference between an Android update and any other mobile OS update is that with Android it's all public, while the other OEMs keep their updates secret until they roll them out. It's not so much that Android takes longer to get updated, but that we can see the gap between when it's ready and when it actually happens, which is especially apparent with Nexus devices.

Android on average has seen an update every 6-9 months, and it can take between a few weeks and 6 months for the most recent update to get pushed out to our phones (depending on what phone we have and how big the update is).

iOS has a yearly update that happens at the same time every year. So a few months before the update is ready, Apple stops working on it, locks down the code and starts the process of getting the update ready to roll out to all the devices. This process happens in private, so we can't see the months they spend going from code to an update ready to be pushed out. (Windows follows largely the same model, but they have a shorter, bumpier, history of updates).

If we look at how many updates have actually been pushed out to phones Android is way ahead in both number and speed. The difference is that we can see clearly the lag between when the code is ready and when the update is ready. We can also see the difference between how long it takes to get an update ready for different phones. With iOS, that all happens behind closed doors, so we just see the update pop up one day.

Right - ""embrace and extend."" Take the shared project, and then add stuff to drive a wedge between your variant and everyone else's.

This was a problem four years ago - today, it's become a catastrophe. This critically impacts developers, because their apps run wildly differently on half of the devices and don't run *at all* on the other half. (Also, trying to submit and update your app to a half-dozen different app stores must be a lot of fun.)

We can see the result of this sprawl by looking at Windows, which has struggled with similar problems for years. The upshot is that .NET is saddled with a bunch of half-implemented or previously-worked-but-now-broken APIs: old versions of DirectX, COM interfaces, replaced pen-and-touch layers, basic networking functionality that's been replaced with similarly-named equivalents, ActiveX cruft, Office interop libraries, etc. The only Windows functionality that devs can *rely* on as still being there in a few years is the absolute most basic stuff, which is why so many third-party apps have UIs that feel kind of primitive.

Android has the same problem, but even worse. At most, Microsoft has had to support four concurrently-used versions of Windows to support (XP, Vista, 7, and 8) - Android currently has *eight*. How do you manage the development of an application to run well on eight different OS versions? Is that even possible? Or are app developers going to go the Linux route, and begin distributing their stuff as source code that users have to compile for their particular Android distro?

The only thing crazier than the magnitude of this problem is Google's complete apathy about it.

Windows does an O.K. job with security updates and service packs, but they won't give you the next version of windows for free. 

Where android falls short is that it doesn't have any security updates, and it is sort of hard to do this with the design of android. It is created in a way which allows any manufacturer to change the system code, even the way it updates, so with that in mind, and especially the fact that every OEM will modify the software differently, it is somewhat impossible to send out any OS or security updates to all devices because generally the OS is only similar to AOSP, a.k.a. stock Android.

Have you ever used their C++ libraries? If you think .NET libraries are saddled with half-implemented/Broken API I invite you to use their C++ libraries for stuff.

      SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail(info, &amp;data, NULL, 0, &amp;bufferSize, NULL);
              
      if (GetLastError() == ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER)
      {
            PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA interfaceData;
            interfaceData = (PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA)malloc(bufferSize);
            interfaceData-&gt;cbSize = sizeof(SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA);

            SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail(info, &amp;data, interfaceData, bufferSize, NULL, &amp;DeviceInfoData);

So... basically I have to call a function, have it return an error and then call it again a second time with the correct buffer size.

The backup taken on windows Vista cannot be restored on Windows 8 and for some reason Microsoft has removed the 'Windows 7 backup' function completely in Windows 8.1, although it was a point update.

&gt; To complement the home desktop version, Microsoft also has a Windows 10 Pro edition.

&gt; Alongside these main editions, Microsoft will have Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Education, and Windows 10 IoT Core for smaller gateway devices.

&gt; Customers will continue to help us create Windows 10 even after this summer&amp;#039;s initial release, thanks to the 3.9 million and growing Windows Insiders who are helping us build and test Windows 10.

The only two new ones are an enterprise version of the mobile version of the OS. there hasn't really been one so far, mostly due to lack of Enterprise features and because BYOD meant that Enterprises didn't buy either devices nor OS licenses for them.

The Education version also makes sense. There have been special education discounts and licenses all along. If they tie it to a version it might actually uncomplicated things a bit.

&gt; &amp;quot;Windows will be delivered as a service bringing new innovations and updates in an ongoing manner,&amp;quot; it said, adding that it expected there to be a &amp;quot;Long future&amp;quot; for Windows.

&gt; He said Microsoft had in the past deliberately avoided using the name &amp;quot;Windows 9&amp;quot; and instead chose Windows 10 as a way to signify a break with a past which involved successive stand-alone versions of the operating system.

&gt; Moving to a situation in which Windows is a constantly updated service will break out of this cycle, and let Microsoft tinker more with the software to test new features and see how customers like them, he added.

&gt; People running pirated copies of Windows are going to have to pay - or keep pirating - if they want to update their computers to Windows 10.

&gt; The confusion has revolved around Microsoft&amp;#039;s offer to give free Windows 10 updates to people running Windows 7 and 8.1.

&gt; On Windows 10, Microsoft says that it will display a watermark on the desktop informing people when they&amp;#039;re running a pirated copy, but there don&amp;#039;t appear to be major obstacles to using it.

* IPv6

Meaningless. Internet Protocol is older than 30 years, IPv6 isn't a new development, its incremental change

* Modern Web Servers (Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd)

* USB

There were bus systems before USB.

* MP3 Audio, FLAC Audio, Flash

Wav, raw, midi, ...

* Broadband

Computer networks are older than 30 years. This is like saying ""6 lane roads"" are some great invention because roads had 5 lanes before.

Thankfully I've got access to classic desktop software as both devices use full-scale Windows 8 and not that crippled RT crap. This was my reason for going Windows 8.1 over Android or IOS for my portable devices; having access to the 20-year back-catalogue of Windows software (especially all the great open-source stuff) and not having to go through a walled-garden to install software is great.

156,"&gt; Microsoft Windows was universally detested until 3.11 (and by many still, until Win95).

This isn't an argument you should be using. As someone deep in the tech support industry from an analysis point of view, we tend to have three categories of user.  

* Those who know a little. They don't follow technology and just want it to make their lives easier.  
* Those in the middle. Enough to consider themselves IT people, but not enough to be able to develop software or set up a server or network.
* Those know know a lot. These are the ones who do the serious design and keep all the complex stuff running.

Windows is only liked by the middle group.
The people who just want it to work and make their lives easier find it clunky and awkward. Those who are serious into getting the most out of their equipment tend to find it limiting.

If you were to use self driving in the same light.

* The people who just want their cars to get them from A-B and don't care about their cars are the ones you want to make this work for.  
* The people who are ""into cars"" because they wash them twice a week and drive recreationally (the same as the mid group of IT users who love Windows) are going to be the ones to fight this.  
* The power users are the ones who are building the technology that does this, so they are all for it.

the Google search engine (and the associated information-based advertising) is Google's bread and butter, pretty much all of Google's services are built around it. The only potential competitor to google these days is Bing; The problem is, nobody uses Bing because it isn't great, and it isn't great because nobody uses it (search engines get smarter the more people use them, as they gather more data on search behavior).

As it currently stands Bing isn't making much progress, but there is one big place that is moving bing forward (besides porn): windows OS integration, primarily mobile integration.

People like to scoff at the windows phone, but most anyone who's tried it enjoys the OS. The only real flaw holding Windows phones back is the app market, which is still quite lacking.

With this software, the windows app market will start growing quite a bit; That plus the upcoming flagship W10 phones will generate much more windows phone users, more windows phone users means more people using bing, meaning bing will gradually grow stronger and possibly even more popular, meaning finally Google will have a serious competitor in the search engine market, causing them to lose their golden monopoly and along with it their guarantee of future financial security,- any threat to the Google search engine is a serious threat to Google as a whole.

&gt; Somewhere around late 2013, we started getting a decent number of Windows Phone gigs and that continued throughout the whole 2014.Our experiences? Clients that wanted Windows Phone apps where mainly big companies, like banks, that are expected to have their mobile apps running on almost all platforms.

&gt; Microsoft failed with Windows Phone, and even if Windows 10 succeeds-would you go and develop your Windows 10 app from scratch or just convert it from an existing iOS app? I believe that the answer here is simple.

&gt; Just like Microsoft is waiting for a release of Windows 10 with its flagship phones, potential Windows Phone/10 app customers are waiting for Windows 10 market results to decide whether it makes sense to build an app.

&gt; Microsoft is quietly testing an app that intelligently synchronizes your clipboard across iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows PC. The app, called OneClip, is like Pushbullet in many ways, making it easy to access files across devices with little setup, and may mean Microsoft plans to compete with the company in the future.

&gt; To set up OneClip, it takes a few seconds and requires a PIN code generated on one of your devices.

166,"This is a rage essay (also known as a Howler) which I wrote in response to another redditor's question about Windows 8.1 in another thread. It got so long, that I figured I wanted to cross post it somewhere, and here seems like a good enough place. 

I suspect that Microsoft basically want the new Windows Store to be as profitable and successful as the Xbox Live Arcade, and eventually for them to merge together. To that end, Windows Store starts out pinned to your taskbar, right next to Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer. This isn't a big problem or anything, but I think it's a good first detail for you to be aware of, because it shows you where Microsoft is coming from with the new OS. They want to nickel-and-dime you hard.

To get at the problems of Windows 8... Let me show you a screenshot. Imagine you want to boot Skype in Win7, just hit Start then type S - K - Y - Return, right? Nothing could be easier. Here's what you see when you hit Start - S - K - Y in Windows 8:

http://i.imgur.com/a2D3DI4.png

In Win7, 25% of the screen would change, because the Start menu would pop up, and most of what you would see would be the icon for Skype. Here in Win8, the entire screen has changed, and only 10% of it or so actually contains what I'm obviously looking for.

That's not the real problem, of course. This screen is gaudy and full of unnecessary information (John Nash died today! Dow down, FTSE up!) and ads (play Tiny Troopers free!), but none of those is the real problem.

Have you noticed that there are two Skypes yet? 

""Skype for Desktop"" refers to regular Skype, which I had to install through a third party (Ninite, the best web site ever) even though Microsoft actually owns it. ""Skype for Desktop"" behaves how you would expect. ""Skype,"" on the other hand, is a pre-installed, unremoveable, Windows 8.1 app...

http://imgur.com/FM5IGYO

Here's where this takes you. The whole screen disappears, including the taskbar. If you don't know how to use Alt + Tab, you pretty much will not be able to get back to what you were doing.

I don't even have any idea what's caused this error, seeing as regular Skype signs in with no issues whatsoever. Clicking the ""Try again"" button does nothing; an error chime sounds -- regardless of where I click on the Skype app page.

The Skype app also does not seem to accept my Skype ID. I rebooted the app and now this is what it wants:

http://i.imgur.com/dSdnQrK.png

It's upset that when I installed Windows, I didn't tell it my Microsoft account ID. I even have a Microsoft account, and no trouble remembering the ID or the password, incredibly enough, because I use a Windows phone. I just chose not to because I found it off-putting that Windows 8.1 asked me to give up this information before it even let me use the computer, so I withheld it -- now I guess I'm not allowed to use the Skype app until I play ball.

[More of the same...](http://i.imgur.com/uv7hXse.png)

So, the core of my problem with Windows 8.1 is that a lot of Windows functionality and programs that I like to use have been migrated to these incredibly-badly-designed-you-wouldn't-believe-it-if-I-told-you apps. Some examples:

* ""Camera"" app

* Almost all Windows settings, except truly important ones such as Add or Remove Programs

* Netflix, of all damn things

* OneNote, which I haven't tried in app form but which I know loads of people use

Nobody asked for these changes; it's been a senseless cash grab from start to finish. Fortunately, Ubuntu has never shined brighter as an alternative; I've been running Ubuntu ever since I first started having these experiences, and it has really been beautiful; most everything just works. 

But I want to play Heroes of the Storm, so... Depending on whether Windows 10 is the same kind of shitshow, I will need to either use 10, downgrade to 7 (which I never had problems with from start to finish), or just ignore my desire to play HotS and play Dota 2 instead. God, I wish Blizzard would build Ubuntu releases like a proper dev team.

&gt; The Win32 API that almost all Windows software use is obviously the biggest and best known of these APIs, and in modern versions of Windows is in fact the only API.

Windows only requires updates for 10 years, the upgrades (w/UI changes) are optional.

On OS X the upgrades are mandatory or else one is denied security updates in 3 years.

Windows upgrades tend to not to bloat older hardware down, OS X upgrades do.

208,"No.. I'm not disagreeing with any of that,.. I just don't think success of 1 comes at the cost of the other. That would be like someone saying ""Every time someone buys an AndroidWear watch -- that's 1 less Apple Watch sold."" ..... Well, NO,.. it's not. Or like people saying,.. ""Windows is losing market share overtime someone installs Linux."" 

It's just silly. There's more than enough room in the market for multiple different platforms to all be successful. Different companies take different strategies and different approaches -- and their customers feel loyalty to them for different reasons and place value on different aspects of their services. 

It's completely possible for different companies to all be simultaneously successful. ",1,0.0887254901961,0.21338730871,0.553921568627,0.364162757416,0.75,0.875,122,0.04,12.2,0.0,0.0
209,"Macs save us money in the long run. Employees struggled with Window's 8. We installed classic shell on every computer to combat this. We don't have a full time IT person, we are too small for that so we rely on a part time IT person for help but that costs us 80/hr. 

It comes down to productivity. Our employees are more productive on Macs because they are far easy to use than Win 8 for your avg user. Most of them already own ipads and iphones at home. They are able to learn Yosemite faster than Win 8. 

Example: We use high end brother printers. On a Mac it takes about 15 seconds to set it up. On windows 8 it takes 15 minutes and you need to reboot. Every few months the window's machines and printers stop talking to each other. Best way to fix it it to reinstall the software again. Never once has a Mac stopped talking to one of our printers. 

Preview on Yosemite is the real workhorse that rarely gets the attention it deserves. It's the swiss army knife of apps. No need for adobe. We can sign documents, annotate them, merge, delete pages, create pdf etc. There is nothing close for windows. Mac users in our company live in Preview...

Text messages right in Imessage is amazing for our company. Saves so much time and allows an employee to merge their phone with their computer. 

The app store has everything you need to solve your problem. Safe, cheap, easy to use etc. Examples: Better Snap tool, copy clip and text wash. These are amazing apps that are dirt cheap but increase productively. 1password is simply the most amazing app. (you can use it on windows as well) We can't live without it. I have 47 logins stored in my vault just for work. It seamlessly works with all idevices. Windows app store is a mess!

Our IT guy has many clients, from small to large. He tells me all the companies started by younger people are 100% Macs. He tells me companies such as the one I'm at slowly are adding Macs are people request them. One of our Mac employees left the company, people were fighting over who got his Mac mini. 

I'm sure there is a rebuttal to all of this but if Macs were 20% cheaper we would have bought way more of them. 

Forgot to mention our IT guy who is extremely smart and semi famous in the tech world uses Mac's as well but he runs Linux on all of them. I have no idea why. ",-6,0.275674799235,0.266115268541,0.513921670117,0.287862146807,1.21875,0.821428571429,446,0.00858369098712,11.7368421053,-0.21875,0.175

212,"The more Macs we have, the less IT support we need. With Macs we don't need minor config changes and if we do we can hit a button on the apple configurator. The Mac users also typically figure things out on their own vs Windows 8 requiring google to fix problems. 

Case in point, just look at how tiny the Mac sys prefs are compared to the control panel in Win8. Why the hell does win8 have a control panel with ~50 icons? Mac has ~24..

If google stripped win8 help results from search, Microsoft would be bankrupt. ",-9,0.119444444444,0.10111808802,0.461111111111,0.289704282724,0.266666666667,0.75,99,0.0188679245283,14.1428571429,0.216666666667,0.75
213,"I used Hola for a while but it kept installing a self-named folder in my Downloads folder. Each time i deleted it (only 2-4 times before i realised), it came back.

A couple of weeks ago i done a format and clean Windows install on my computer and went to find something to replace it and AVG (which was quite the resource hog). 

Anyway, i landed on using ZenMate, it's as simple as turning a button on and off and i can use it when i need it (which is only for a few sites), and it doesn't do the whole ""DID THIS WORK? DID OUR SERVICE WORK?"" every time you loaded the fucking page like Hola did.
