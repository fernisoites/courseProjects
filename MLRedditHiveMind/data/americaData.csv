The implementation of that is controversial and some aspects may have been shady but the american people at least thought they were helping. Supporting dictatorships was bad, but communism is way worse. At the time a lot of people thought that china and russia were awesome and doing good things. Now they know the truth and a lot of them are glad they didnt go communist. Yes they also wish they didnt have a dictatorship but America helped (or forced) them to not be communist

1,"&gt; Germany's quite a 'cranky' society really.

Well, what really happens when you invite everyone to the table and say ""Let's reason about things, together?"" 

The largest (in terms of population) Western countries like my own - the USA -  and Russia tend to  get lulled into the notion that reality is self-evident, so we don't really need to discuss anything in a critical fashion. This leads to a situation which is kind of like being in row boat and not being aware that you're being pulled out to sea by the currents. I watched a great [documentary film](https://news.vice.com/video/silencing-dissent-in-russia-putins-propaganda-machine-full-length) the other day about the current public discourse in Russia, and how the mass media plays a role there. It was very interesting because it was like a mirror being put up in front of me and an unflattering image of my own country being reflected back at me.

One might argue that it's better just to take everything that academics say in their current models and act based on it. That would be the least ""cranky"" society, in some people's opinion. This ignores the fact, however, that current academic thought about a matter is regularly proven wrong by the next generation of scientists. If misguided ideas are acted upon now without hestitation, great damage can ensue. If people actually start debating things with eachother on a daily basis, like folks are famous for in Germany... local interests *do* get measured up against national interests, and precautions are seen as important, and people don't throw all caution to the wind.

You may think that science has thoroughly disproved that cold playing over your skin plays any role in a person getting a lung disease we call a ""cold"" (interestingly enough, there's the same play on words in English and in German which connects these two ideas). However, there may indeed be some negative physiological impact from blood that has been chilled by the air around the neck going up into the brain or into other vital organs; perhaps this effect can make one's defenses weaker and more susceptible to certain illnesses.

In stark contrast, my personal experience would tend to back up what *you* are saying. In fact, I think the more pivotal environmental factor in this area is the amount and type of  house dust hanging in the air (maybe viruses cling to this?), and if one refuses to open the windows in the winter, one may not get well as quickly.

Back to our topic, however:

There certainly *are* valid reasons to be concerned about adopting an industrial scale change to using glyphosate along with GMO crops that are bred to resist this chemical - even assuming that glyphosate, itself, has no impact on human health. For example, there are valid concerns about the integrity of natural ecosystems when you get too efficient in pest control. Bird populations in North America are dropping significantly; amphibians, in general, are endangered here.

It's disingenuous to argue that because glyphosate has been proven to be safe for humans and other mammals when used properly -  there is therefore no reason to object to the vast change that biotech companies intend to make to the way agriculture is done. That's the standpoint I feel all the Monsanto supporters in this conversation are arguing from. I haven't heard from anyone who claims that they're a farmer and who wants to discuss their personal experience in this entire 2000+ comment conversation. If there's any personal experience being drawn upon by those in favor of these vast changes in agricultural practice, it sounds like it comes from the angle of the person who wants to sell these substances... who has some sort of vested interest in the business of biotech, and not just a bystander who has an innocent excitement about how the technology works.

The fact that German policy makers do not always let business interests steam roll over local interests or the need to be cautious when looking at the option of employing new technologies like 

1. biotech in agriculture, 
2. at high pressure injection of questionable chemicals into the deep earth (fracking), 
3. or continuing to using nuclear fission for public electricity generation

Yeah, sure. They wanted to do good while they were arming fascist death squads and orchestrating a coup d'etat which will lead a US-backed military rule that will commit numerous crimes because they would lose banana profits. That was trying to be good. Or, they were actually trying to be good while they were backing numerous military rules around the globe, like in Brazil, in Greece, in Turkey, in Argentina, in Chile just for the good of the people, not for their interests. They had colonized Philippines for their own good. =)

Sure, France was importing it's modernity to it's colonies and England was helping China. You know, also iii. Reich was helping poor Europe for establishing a white, progressive dream.

6,"Israel has 400 people/km^2. Kuwait has 200/km^2, Lebanon has 500/km^2 ...the Gaza strip has 5000 people/km^2. 

I am always so fascinated with Israel's pompous attitude on the matter. Its as if you think we don't understand that the UN and America gave you everything you needed to invade what is now your country, and then have the audacity to act as if it was smoke and mirrors and Gaza just simply came from nothing. I agree with the nation of Israel as an idea, whole heartedly would like to see it prosper, but actions do speak louder than words or ideas. 

What happens if someone is drunk in one of those buildings and asleep? What if someone is sick? Regardless, this is much more than bombings. Gaza is a wasteland, with poor sewage, little infrastructure, and a blockade blocking any supplies to rebuild at pace needed. They are forced to travel into Israel nonetheless (if they can) and are accosted by dozens of restrictive checkpoints to check their identity etc which can make going out and buying something a day's errand. I think the average Israeli poorly understands what the situation in Gaza is like, similar to how many Americans have no idea what Tijuana and South America is really like. They have never seen true poverty. Perhaps from so much experience roaming Gaza, the military does understand the situation in Gaza.

And you're right. Sadly Gaza will be a pivotal fuel in causing both Israel and the West to fight this nonsense ISIS in Iraq and Syria for at least the next 20 years, radical Jihad as a whole probably the lions share of this century.

7,"Everyone saying these dams are the best solution really have no idea what the reality of hydrolectric power is. I think it would be great to bring more power to the people of Brazil and improve their outdated infrastructure, but these dams are just going to bring more development to areas *along* the Amazon and its' tributaries.

People somehow assume that if I'm against the dams, I must not care about all the people living there, which couldn't be more true. The greatest natural resource of Brazil, and one could argue our entire world, is the Amazon basin. I don't want to see it go the way of America, which suffered from *massive* and widespread deforestation. 

Many people don't realize North America used to be covered in old-growth forests. Incredible ecosystems that are now found in only a few select spots around the world were wiped out *forever* because the people cutting them down didn't realize what they were doing, they just saw the huge trees as a quick and easy way to make money. We can't take what we did back. In a hundred years when Brazil's forests continue to dwindle and the Amazon is a polluted shithole like the Ganges, people will look back and say they made a mistake.

EDIT: And another great example of something the United States fucked up royally and many communities are now paying for it is our own dam infrastructure. We built a huge number of dams in the early half of the century, oftentimes damming up entire rivers. Many of these dams are now in disrepair and quite dangerous. Removing a dam is not an easy task, and repairing a badly planned and inefficient dam is not ideal.  When you place gigantic walls at intervals along a river, you drastically change the way fish migrate along the river. Even with fish ladders and other solutions, many fish simply can't make it and the ecosystem suffers over time.",3,0.168819444444,0.245536347602,0.593859126984,0.310219444738,0.838888888889,1.0,334,0.0459183673469,22.2666666667,0.5,0.5

&gt;So are you? you are the who gave weird justifications about rapes in paris and brazil Its quite clear who are sick .


Bringing up that our conversations have been about women's rights is what is called a strawman.  Don't go the strawman route.  Let us stay on point here.  The ""justifications"" about these rapes is that atleast for France, it wasnt 6 men raping 1 woman.  It wasnt 6 men beating her or tossing her out of a moving train which leads to her death.

Brazil, you are right.  It was a mass rape on public transport but they didnt even murder her.  They did beat her and Im surprised they didnt kill her.

Right now, the one's who are sick are those Indian men which involved 6 men raping a young woman, beating her to the point where she dies a few days later.  And those men who tried to rape a mother and daughter but when they tried to fight back they pushed the daughter out of the vehicle and she dies.

Did any of the links you provided have any of that?


&gt;What they are saying is that they don't have mass transit rapes.  I can't recall a state sanctioned public transport where all the men raped one woman or threw out another because she didnt want to be molested.  

Remember when I said that?  

&gt; really the person who defends their country and call it making a point ? 

You link an article about the American mass rape but thats not what I said.  So unless I am mistaken, the beach is not public transport. 


  Brazil has had a mass rape on a bus but didnt murder the woman.  I did remember reading about that one but do you know why mass rape on a public vehicle will always be thought of as an Indian thing?  Not only has it happened again, but the fact that the people had to protest this for several days to try and get better protection for women and basically riots broke out. What did the Brazilians do?  Nothing.  Thats probably why the bus rapes will be associated with India. 

&gt; But its okay since from centuries some people have felt superior by looking down on others, spreading propaganda against some people while ignoring obvious problems at home ,

Pretty sure I mentioned about how America is associated with gun violence but you keep this strawman going.  Ill add more.  We have pretty bad healthcare, we're all fat,  our police are murderers and our government likes to start wars.  Murder still happens.  Rape still happens.  Pedophilia still happens.  Muggings, robbings, beatings and racism still happens.  I never denied any of this.  At all.  Even in the beginning.  The only thing I have ever denied was a rape involving more then 3 people on a bus. You pointed out 1 and grasped for straws with the other links and assumed you won when you didnt (""Im laughing"" is what you put).  All you did was prove me right.

Again, you're debunking claims that I've never made.  I've never said that the west ""uniformly"" addressed the issue, because they haven't.  Despite their claims, America has legally recognized gay marriage, in over 36 instances.  Which is why it's legal in most of the country.  I asked how many legal recognitions are needed before one of them count, and didn't get an answer.

&gt;Ironically enough, when you generalized ""the west"" as having entirely recognized gay marriage, you were the one making the claim that some states = all states.

Again, you're putting words in my mouth.  You'll notice that I never once used the word ""entirely"", because it doesn't apply.  They haven't entirely recognized gay marriage.  I generalized the west as having accepted gay marriage because **generally** they've accepted it, more than any other geopolitical region.  Similarly, one could say with just as much accuracy that the west recognizes interracial marriage, even though there are still some westerners who don't approve.

I'm not sure if English is your first language, and if it isn't I apologize.  But people usually generalize a region's actions and beliefs to refer to the majority of the population, because outliers in a population will always exist.  The beliefs of a population are *never* uniform.

70,"In a nutshell, common law refers to the everyday laws we pass and our societal opinions on what should be legal, illegal and appropriate punishments. Constitutional law is the broad set of guidlines for creating government, stating the rights of the people and the process for writing everyday laws. 

what I think /u/Gredorian is saying is that if you make a gigantic constitution that gets into very very very fine detail about specific laws, you create a document that can't always adjust to changing times and has far reaching affects farther down the line. If you do this, you would have to change the Constitution through amendments frequently which can erode its viability as the law of the land. You don't write in a Constitution that murder is illegal and state the penalties. 1820 any murder was hanging, no questions asked. Our idea of justice has changed since then. Or alcohol prohibition which went as an amendment and didn't work out so well.  

Our Constitution is changeable, but requires a super-majority and has only happened 27 times. And only once did we have to repeal an amendment. That's a good thing. It gives the document legitimacy. By proxy it also gives the government legitimacy. Some states in the US haven't followed that example, and they have had to rewrite their own Constitutions as a result. Texas's Constitution has been re-written 5 times and even now has over 600 amendments. 

We also follow English common law and US style Federalism too. Which means the Federal government delegates more day to date stuff to state and local government anyway (99% of criminal law is done at the state level for example.) Latin America follow Napoleonic common law which emphasize laws set at higher levels with the federal government exercising nearly all laws and control.

They neglect to also mention that most of these extinctions occurred during the last Ice Age (Pleistocene), ending about 12,500 years ago, and were likely heavily influenced by climate change.

On the argument that you have more culture....probably not.

Thanks for your reply. I was kind of with you up until then. 
  
The problem which a lot of Americans do not seem to grasp is that people all over the world will have similar stories to yours. In terms of lying about your age to enlist, a distant relative of mine did just that and died at Gallipoli when he was 16. All four of my grandparents fought in WW2. My grandfather ran up the beach in Normandy on D-Day and was there when Belsen concentration camp was liberated, which affected him so much he never spoke about what he saw. The RAF won the Battle of Britain against all odds and this is when we could have comfortably allied with Hitler in the first place. So we can all pull out patriotic stories and tales of bravery. America is not exceptional in this regard.

Oh give it a fucking rest. One thing I hate more then the government is blinkered supporters of Assange.

Let's list it:

* The charges of rape were filed long before the wikileaks scandal so these are not new trumped up charges
* There has been no request from America to extradite Assange
* America didn't even ask the UK (who has the closest extradition treaty in the world with America) to send Assange over, and they had months to do it before he ran and hid in the embassy.
* Sweden has the most balanced and neutral legal system in the entire world, the idea of Sweden (a notoriously neutral country) being Americas bitch in this is so absurd it's actually laughable.

93,"Well, I lived with an elderly woman in Bath, England for a good deal of the time and also with a farm family in some small German town I cant recall the name of or hope to spell, outside of Munich. But I did make it a point to see the large cities. 

For the second point, its just a matter of knowing American history. I'm no expert but here is what I can tell you. For example, many don't know that the Spanish came to America long before the English. I am from a city that was founded the 16th century. The capital of the state I am from, NM, is older than Phildelphia or the Constitution. The Spanish brought us our language, food, and metal. Over the hundreds of years that passed they intermarried with the natives and as a result the state has its own culture. The family names are incredibly old. You can trace the original areas of Spain a family came from by many of the surnames. In fact, my mothers family is of mixed Basque/native blood. :)  This is just the state I come from, that I have knowledge on. I'm sure someone from Louisiana can give you some history on the French communities and culture that is very very strong there to this day.  
America (quite horrifically) imported slaves from all over Africa. Later, we had the Chinese come over in great numbers to build our railroads. As a result, we have communities that are shaped by these cultures, while not being inclusive to them. Our black community gave us much of our defining culture, style and music which has since been exported world-wide. Our large cities have pockets of every corner of the globe within them. I now live in Los Angeles and as I mentioned before in a post, one neighborhood here (just *one* neighborhood, mind you) is home to the most ethnic Koreans outside of Seoul, S. Korea.  I can name areas of town that are nicknamed after the historical migrant communities that live there... Little Armenia, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Bangladesh, Little Ethiopia, the list goes on and on. Don't forget the millions of Mexicans and South Americans here also. And these are just the areas I know about, in a city of 14 million people, an area of 400 or so square miles. This is only the second biggest city. New York is arguably far more diverse.
The Northern part of our country is full of ethnic Scandinavians. My grandparents on my fathers side were German and Swedish, from North Dakota. The East Coast is chock full of European heritage, they brought that here. Not only the English who settled, but the waves of Italian, Irish, Jewish and German and Dutch people who came as well. Then, we have our indigenous people from all over the continent. My mothers mom is part Navajo. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Europe has no ""native"" people other than the Basque and the Samii. In America we had thousands of tribes with incredibly diverse language and culture. They looked different, had different societies, etc. Today, we have far fewer in number, but the culture left still exists in a lot of areas where they were eradicated. 

America is a huge melting pot. We, as part of our mission statement, open our arms to other cultures. Europe is a lot more inclusive. ",-35,0.128190407476,0.230414662539,0.401913923819,0.303905771582,1.2125,1.0,575,0.0359281437126,15.1315789474,0.4,0.9

In the late 1800s, California in particular started freaking out about Chinese immigrants, because they had a strong work ethic and did everything, no matter the job or the conditions.  They started being looked at as competition among the working class, and so what's now called ""Yellow Panic"" set in.  The Chinese were discriminated against, and eventually the US moved to restrict immigration.  Chinese immigrants were also barred from naturalization because they were deemed ""unassimilatable"".

Eventually the restrictions got overturned in 1947, but then communism rose to power in China in 1949, and by then, the Red Scare was just about poised to go into full swing along with the Cold War, so forget about accepting the Chinese then.  Even when the Cold War ended, America was still so ""NO COMMUNISM BAD"" from 40ish years of anti-Communist sentiment and the threat of nuclear war hanging over our heads that it was ingrained that you don't trust the commies.

165,"&gt; But how is this possible when they have widespread access to the internet?

Much of the problem is cultural: Russia is still a world power and Russians consume domestic news because they're biased in favor of Russia which, to be fair, is a great country in every sense of the word. The average Russian living in a major cosmopolitan area consumes a great amount of classic literature and high art (think opera and the like), much of the former of which is nationalist in nature. The second most prominent language in scientific publications is Russian. In reality, Russia is therefore somewhat similar to America in that we read Huck Finn in school, have an active country music scene and, generally speaking, have a healthy dose patriotism. Our view of lower-class Russians as vodka drunk risk-taking idiots is almost identical to their view of lower-class Americans as obese hicks drunk off of moonshine driving scooters through Wal Mart. This is obviously an oversimplification, but Russia and America have quite a bit in common so therefore what's wrong?

Russia's largest problem is that it has a victim complex: people are still furious about losing the Cold War. The downfall of the Soviet Union was, objectively, a good thing for everyone although the subsequent ills of shock capitalism have done the West no favors. Nor did overt gloating in Washington, London and Paris. Unlike most revolutions, the previous elite are still in charge although with a different face: the Russian Marshal with a chest full of medals has been replaced by the dashing be-suited bureaucrat with a Patek Philippe. In the chaos of post-communist Russia, the people looked to strong leaders who could provide stability in a dangerous world and Putin's KGB credentials made him popular. Simply put, people preferred Putin's antics and outright corruption to a lack of good government. Ominously, so did the Germans in 1933 when Hitler was elected Chancellor.

The question now is whether or not the West is willing to stand up to Putin. Putin's biggest flaw is that he can never appear weak: Putin is never sick. He is never wrong. Sanctions mean nothing because his propaganda machine links privation to the sacrifices endured by this generation's grandparents during the Second World War. Even when Putin abandoned his wife in a nation that prizes family values, he was discreetly applauded for his virility in selecting a younger woman who could keep up with his stamina. Putin has one weakness, however.

His regime depends upon the projection of hyper-masculine strength and the (probable) general train of thought in Washington and London is that the devil we know is better than the devil we don't know. Had Obama been less dovish in the Ukraine and sent a carrier group in assistance, he could've shut down the entire Crimean Anschluss in an instant. Putin could have gone home screaming about American interference and he wouldn't have had to press his hand in the fashion that he did. It's not like the Kremlin's stupid. They know Crimea is their West Berlin.

The answer therefore doesn't require actual hard power, but the appearance of hard power. Putin needs to be seen as duking it out in Russia's favor against a semi-aggressive West in order to preserve stability at home and he appears to have won. Putin has therefore been proven right on all fronts. Until the West steps up to the plate in a meaningful way, this state of affairs will continue to evolve down a more totalitarian track in the way that they did in Germany between 1933-1939.",125,0.0513693437574,0.273073363625,0.475949419569,0.323109684879,1.16,1.0,612,0.0432432432432,21.1034482759,-0.266666666667,0.633333333333

You pretend yo care about lives, yet the only lives that were in fact lost were the lives of civilian caused by recklessness, and the life of American moral authority. You crying over manning doing harm by revealing the truth is like a gangster crying that someone snitched him up on a series of gangland murders. snitches get stitches right? You have the morality of a career criminal or a prison inmate.

&gt; I hate government cover ups as much as the next guy

no you don't you apologise for them, your gay for them, you love anything that'll give America a short term advantage, regardless of morality, if that's killing a civilian, so be it, committing corporate espionage, you're cool with it. you are like someone who shoplifts from a 7 eleven, you can only see the short term benefit of enjoying a free candy bar, not that people will consider you a scumbag for being that guy who is caught time and again stroking stuff and thinks he's clever enough to get away with it. That's why the soviets lost the cold war, they kept saying they were good, while doing dirt in plain sight, in the end nobody trusted anything they said, same with Putin, same with the NSA after snowden, same with the CIA after 40 years of disclosures of drugging their own people, selling drugs, weapons, same with politicians negotiating shit like the TPP in secret, no body believes that these things are for our common good, lore likely a power grab or a brown envelope of cash is going into a pocket somewhere. 

&gt; but even I refuse to believe that all information should be free. I don't subscribe to freedom of all information to such a ludicrous extent.

it's free wither you like it or not. and it's shown a pattern of abuse, corruption, lies and cheating in US foreign policy that needs to be fixed. You don't have to like it, but you have a civic duty to be informed of the truth and to exert pressure to improve the system to be less slimy in ideology and more American.

&gt; Whatever limits there should have been, she went past them

told too much of the truth? sounds like a coward caught red handed whining about snitches again. you can't face the truth. no country is perfect, but banning the truth and revealing the bad parts is undemocratic, it prevents society from addressing the skeletons in the closet. The crimes of the Soviet Union post cold war are well documented in history and movies, but the crimes of the US are suppressed.

&gt; but not everything the U.S. Military knows should be accessible to the world.

You'll be glad to hear that this didn't happen, only stuff related to the illegal war of aggression in Iraq was revealed to the world. I see that war as being no different than Russia invading Ukrane, an illegal war (Russia actually used Iraq as a precedent, a justification for their actions in the Ukrane, sharing the same ideology). The truth of that war saved American lives also  by bringing to to an end sooner, like the Vietnam war and the pentagon papers. Daniel Ellsberg was treated as you treat manning, yet he saves American lives and was vindicated by history. therefore, as much as you claim to love fictional lives lost as a result of the leaks, you actually want more American lives lost as a direct result of your argument, you crave their deaths, you relish the prospect of it, like Stalin, because you are an intellectual coward who has embraced soviet ideology in the west. You hate everything the America stands for. I don't understand why.

&gt; She's damn lucky. She'd be dead right now if anyone had died. I still hold her accountable for whatever deaths might have happened due to her carelessness.

not really, the truth and the real lives saved by ending an unjust cowardly war based on soviet ideology and cowardice, justified the (zero) deaths caused by the leak. it's funny that you sound disappointed by the fact that there were no deaths as a result of the leak ;) as if you relish a death that you can exploit to to progress the political ideology of soviet style doctrine and arrogance. 

&gt; Lives matter more to me.

&gt; I'm pretty neutral on the whole thing myself. It's complicated. My issue rests entirely with the fact that your argument is faulty.

What is that argument that you find faulty?  The phrase ""in war innocence dies first"" is a famous line from All Quiet on the Western Front.  The fact that during war, innocent people die and the morality of innocence dies first, is a well known fact.

&gt;  You're just bringing up something else and saying ""war is hell"" and acting like that settles it. People can, and are, against all the actions listed as well as the government of Israel's handling of the situation, and Hamas as well.

No, I'm bringing up war and how hellish it is to demonstrate how even America acts during war.

Your taxes as an American pay for that CIA torture program.  Your taxes as an American pay for Guantanamo bay.  Your taxes pay for the government that you elect.  You have no such relationship with Israel.  You do not elect their leaders.  You do not pay their taxes.

Therefore, it is hypocritical to expect Israel to behave in a way you cannot even get your own government to behave.

No dude, the US military is the one at issue. The US military is not as crazy as others, which is why I said that.

No, covering something up requires action to be taken to cover something up. The alleged rapes were never reported to the military in the first place so there is no way to cover it up.

&gt; Try taking some personal responsibility for the rape culture in the military, that you some how pretend does not exist.

You mean the culture of rape that has a rape rate of is equal or lower than matching civilian populations, such as college? Or are we talking about the US military that has a higher conviction rate then the civilian population for rape and sexual crimes? Or the one that plays PSAs about rape twice every hour on TV every single day of the year? Or the one that requires 4 hours of Sex Assault education every year for every soldier? The one that automatically provided medical and mental assistance with no questions asked and no report made if the victim wants no report? The one that has a confidential Sexual Assault Person for every 100 soldiers, whos sole job is to recieve reports, help victims, and educate soldiers? Or the one that provides an attorney to the victim free and is the only organization that allows a rape victim to report a crime, take it to court martial, and not require them to give testimony? Is that the culture you are talking about? Because if so you are a fucking moron that needs to start looking at the facts rather than the bullshit spewing out of the mouths of uneducated politicians looking to get some quick votes.

&gt; This isn't a court room, you are telling possible rape victims they are liars because you do not feel they have presented YOU with enough evidence.

No, I am saying that stating that US service members have been ""linked"" to a rape requires some kind of evidence, of which there is none. That matters. Accused would be the correct word, as the only thing that there is right now is an accusation with no evidence. The reason it matters is because this is being reported by a country that we talk to quite often and this is the kind of baseless accusations that sour negotiations.

Crimea has itself tried to leave Ukraine and join Russia and Kiev government has basically castrated the region for it. They are poor and destitute and want out.

279,"&gt; Iran says ""death to America"". Are they ""anti-Americanite""? Iraqi soldiers want the end of Britain. Are they ""Anti-Britishite""? No. Both these people have greivances that have found expression in war. It is only with the Jewish folk that wanting to kill the people who killed your family is ""racist and unconstructive"".

Wanting to kill every single Jew is ""racist and unconstructive."" Wanting to commit genocide is ""racist and unconstructive."" Why is this so hard for you to understand?

Why was and is Fatah not agitating for genocide? By 1988, when Hamas penned their Charter, they had suffered as much and more from Israel. What's the difference? I'll tell you - Hamas' antisemitism.

I'm not saying that wanting to fight Israel is antisemitic. Fatah is not antisemitic like Hamas. I'm saying that wanting to commit genocide is. I cannot repeat this enough.

&gt;I don't ignore it. I strongly condemn it. But the leaders of Hamas are cold-blooded killers manipulating uneducated masses. They need to go.

Then stop saying that they aren't antisemitic and stop demanding different standards of behavior. Hold everyone to the same standard. End the bigotry of low expectations.

&gt;There is already a slow genocide happening in Gaza. That is why I find it frustrating when people talk as you are.

No there isn't! Gaza has one of the highest birth rates and one of the lowest mortality rates on the planet. If you think that this is a ""slow genocide"" then you need to hit the dictionary again.

&gt;Nowhere near enough people have lost family to give an overwhelming majority of support to her. Therein lies the difference.

Shaked and the ghost of Kahane don't have an ""overwhelming majority of support."" But the number of people supporting them doesn't matter - the double standard you have concerning those supporters is the problem.

&gt;And also: The very fact that Israel has not wiped the Palestinians from the map is a demonstration that my double-standard is apt. If the Palestinians could do it, they would. The Israeli's can do it, but they haven't....yet.

That doesn't justify your double standard at all. Nothing justifies double standards.

&gt;Again, I don't think Israel uses this distinction often in Gaza so I find it hard to suddenly start applying it. Economic blockade, security checkpoints and artilerry bombardments that cannot be answered seem pretty genocidal.

Economic blockade and security checkpoints aren't killing people.

Israel's civilian-to-militant ratio is better than America's in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Israel's killed fewer people over that same period besides. American even sent military officials to learn from Israel how to avoid civilian casualties! But no one is saying that America is committing genocide. Here is another double standard.

&gt;By negotiating, small concessions made from each side, you'll eventually find that the hate preachers lose favour to the pragmatists.

""We promise to only be alive every other Sunday"" is not a concession. Even if you didn't learn from the Munich Agreement, Israel certainly did.

&gt;Again, diplomacy is precisely for making peace with the people who want to kill you and historically it's a better alternative to war. Especially when given that terrorist groups do not lose ground-wars.

Diplomacy does not work when one side wants to commit genocide. Diplomacy can and will work with Fatah, not Hamas.

&gt;The difference between the Nazi's and Hamas is the the Nazi's had significant resources and power while Hamas has virtually zero.

And appeasing the Nazis made them stop . . . how?

Appeasing Hamas will make them stop wanting to commit genocide . . . how?

&gt;I disagree entirely. It is not reasonable to hold all people to the same standards. Do you hold states in Africa, torn apart by civil war and lack of education, to the same standards as the West? If you simply refuse to work with them until they, for example, have universal human rights then THEY WILL NEVER GET IT, because often people need assitance to learn the lessons you've learned.

I hold them to the same standards, yes. The world should forcibly stop their attempts at genocide, remove their leaders from power, and enforce real democracy. Consider what America did in occupied Japan after WW2. That is, essentially, what Fatah asked the Arab League to do with Hamas. That is the only solution when dealing with genocidal groups.

&gt;I don't excuse Hamas at all. But Hamas is an entity born only of hatred. Israel is a nation, the sum of its people in the form of its democracy. **It is capable of change. Hamas is not.**

I agree - and the logical conclusion is that there can be no negotiation with Hamas. If they cannot change, diplomacy is fruitless. Why don't you see that?

&gt;In the end you can rant and rave all you like about my double standard. But if you expect a cobra not to bite you because you hold it to the same standard as a person, you're going to have a hard time.

Asking a cobra to stop biting doesn't do anything, either.

&gt;They want to commit genocide because of the horrific things they have suffered. It's not unreasonable you have to show that you don't intend to kill them before they believe the negotiations are genuine. Think of all the times settlements have sabotaged such negtations for example.

That right there is apology for genocide. This is the consequence of your double standard.

There is no excuse for genocide, not even suffering your own genocide. No Jew wanted to commit genocide against Germany. No Armenian wanted to commit genocide against Turkey. If actually suffering a real fucking genocide didn't make them want to commit genocide in retribution, how the hell can settlement do that?

&gt;Note the calender date and lets at least use logic and reason when asserting ownership based on time.

Crimea under Russian Jurisdiction 1783-1954 171 years

Alabama under American Jursidiction 1819-2015 196 years

Crimea is conquered Turk land just as much as Alabama is conquered Native American land. America and Russia are imperialist expansionist nations and they have ethnically cleansed the territories they conquered.

&gt;An important point is that the most recent modern activity with respect to Crimea, is a Politician in Russia signed it over to Ukraine not long ago. As a sign of good faith in the relationship between the two nations as well as other dealings.

France sold of Louisiana to the US in good faith but I don't see French warships and troops invading a neighbor state. Russia too sold of Alaska to America in good faith but I don't see Russia trying to annex Alaska.

&gt;What kind of BULLSHIT is that? who do you think you are kidding? Please elaborate on this claim

Have you never heard of The Trail of Tears? http://www.al-tn-trailoftears.net/

American motorcyclists remember what atrocities they did to the Native Americans but Russian motorcyclists like the night wolves ride in arrogance and pride towards Berlin when the Russians [raped the land when invading Germany.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany)

&gt;Look, the Russians did win WWII lets get our facts straight.

And they sided with the Nazis and [paraded with them in Brest litovsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eGo-NEcEVI) but that is another topic. Russia did not win WW2 alone there were also other ethnicites within their ranks. Lets also not forget [lend lease to Russia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_USSR)

&gt;Russia has done nothing, while many other nations have done all kinds of things with respect to taking over sovereign nations, stream rolling governments basically doing whatever they want with no regard for people or life at all.

What is the Customs Union all about? What is BRICS all about? Why did Russia invade Crimea? Russia has not been sleeping all this time. It has been planning carefully on how to regain the power it once had when it was the Soviet Union. 

&gt;Russia has all the responsibility in this situation when infact Russia is maintaining a defensive position to protect its national interests and its people.

Did Ukraine invade Russia? Where there Ukrainian troops barricading Russia's Sevastopol base? It is the opposite. The mental gymnastics you show is baffling. Invasions of territory is now defensive strategy. So you justify America invading Iraq because Iraq posed a threat to US security? It seems so because you justify Russian invasion of Crimea because the new Ukrainian government posed a threat to Russia somehow with its dilapidated army.

&gt;What you see EU, USA, Canada and all the others doing is not that, but instead imperialism.

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imperialism

1 a policy or practice by which a country increases its power by gaining control over other areas of the world

2 the effect that a powerful country or group of countries has in changing or influencing the way people live in other, poorer countries

Russia fits definition one it has gained territory from Ukraine in violation of 1997 Treaty on the Status of the Black Sea Fleet. Russia also fits definition two as well through the Eurasian Customs Union. Just the same America fits definition one through all of its military bases and definition two through NATO.

Both state are Imperialists. Only people without agendas would admit that.

So did Russia when it occupied eastern Europe and created puppet states in places like Poland and the Baltics and split nations like Germany into two separate nations. It also hindered self determination during the Prague Spring and the Hungarian revolution of 1956.

Russia is no better than the US in manipulating other countries for its benefit. 

&gt;So did Russia invade Ukraine? No. 

By definition they did. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/invading

: **to enter (a place, such as a foreign country) in order to take control by military force**

First the Kremlin [lied to everyone that there were no Russian troops in Crimea](http://sputniknews.com/russia/20140304/188087074.html) and then [Putin even admits that he sent Russian troops to occupy Crimea.](http://rt.com/news/crimea-defense-russian-soldiers-108/)

This lying to the world about things has cast America in a bad light in the world stage ever since Iraq invasion and the Lying of Putin has now cast Russia in a bad light as well. Both instances have tarnished the reputation of both nations integrity.

&gt;defensive tactic of Russia to grab Crimea.

So preemptive strikes are defensive moves and then in that case America was within its right to invade Iraq because they were a threat to the american people with their weapons of mass destruction. That was a lie there were no WMDs and there was no Maidan violence in Crimea. Both invasions are based on a lie. Defenders do not attack first, only aggressors initiate force. If preemptive strikes are valid forms of self defense then the Invasion of Iraq was justified. 

&gt;Who is grabbing Ukraine? Well, lets just follow the money shall we? If you are able to, go ahead and drum up any recent contracts penned in Ukraine over the past year worth over say, 10m. who holds them, what are they for and if that tells you nothing, then we can close this conversation.

[And did not Russia bribe Yanukovich with 15 billion dollars?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_December_2013_Ukrainian%E2%80%93Russian_action_plan)

Both sides were playing a dangerous game of bribing Ukraine. Poroshenko chose Europe and Yanukovich chose Russia. What's your point? Countries have the right to choose whom they deal with. Ukraine is now more Eurocentric than Russocentric like the last administration. 

&gt;It is not about anything other than self preservation in the face of a daunting enemy force lapping at the borders.

So self preservation at the cost of invading and alienating a ""brother nation"" and demonizing their entire culture as fascistic? 

And onto the forces ""lapping at the borders"", do you know why NATO expanded? Because of fears from the occupied nations like Poland and the Baltics and Czech Republic and Hungary knew what the Kremlin was capable of and wanted defense in the form of the US instead of forming standing armies themselves. They wanted to be apart of NATO and never again under the Kremlin. NATO could have denied them but didn't. 

NATO too could have dissolved as the Kremlin threat died but now with recent Russian aggression you see NATO building up again. NATO was already in malaise as the EU nations have not been meeting the standards of 5% GDP spending on defense due to the EU financial crisis, but NATO is now mobilizing after Russia's recent aggression in Ukraine.

I would rather see an independent Europe than one divided among Kremlin and White House rule. 

&gt;After years and years of assembly and trying, the global elite have now captured the majority of the nations.

And you think Russian Oligarchs are not apart of that same system? All of their money is held off shore in places like London and elsewhere. Even the Elites children do not even live in Russia but in Europe. The Germans are reluctant to put on sanctions on Russia because both financial and business elite have mutual interest in expanding markets and not war. 

Territorial expansion is useless when trade is more important in the minds of the West. That is why they have abandoned 19th century imperialism in favor for trade domination. Russia is the one that thinks 19th century irredentism is still valid. If Russia can take back Crimea, why cannot Germany gain back Ostpreussen. Russia did set that precedent. If it is valid for Russia then is it not also valid for Germany?

Worst case is that we fire a nuke in North Korea, then Russia, and China pick it up on their radars, believing that they are under attack, or about to be, fire back at the USA. Canada and Europe, Australia, New Zealand pick this up on their radars, and fire their nukes.

Have you seen the value of the Euro lately? Have you seen the DAX vs the FTSE or the Dow Jones. Second fuck off with your Euro immigrants stealing jobs routine it's an absolute falsehood. It's been shown time and time again that Euro immigration not only provides a net benefit in the UK in terms of tax, but they also fill a labour shortage taking jobs that UK nationals do not want to do. If you restricted European immigration it would not solve any unemployment issues, in fact it would make the UK a lot poorer because you'd have the same unemployment, less tax payers, and a labour shortage that UK national unemployed would not want to fix.

Finally don't talk to me about fucking social mobility. You do not increase social mobility by giving breaks to businesses, all that fucking does is increase social mobility for the lucky few while reducing it for everyone else. Don't fucking talk to me about apprenticeships either, Germany has the best apprenticeships in the world and the reason they work, unlike Britain's broken system, is because those apprenticeships lead to well paid, regulated job backed by strong unions, the very opposite of what the Tories want. 

Germany's strong economy is a direct reaction to not being like the Tories and letting nepotism creep into our culture with this ridiculous attitude of self-made men being the brave and the bold, the only ones deserving of wealth whilst the salary man gets fucking the arse. Our success can be directly attributed to maintain the idea of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and keeping the salaries for ordinary middle class people (not fucking entrepreneurs) at a high level. Yes, even the people who do the shit unskilled jobs deserve a good rate of pay, unlike what the Tories would have. 

You really believe this shit which is sad, but all your arguments are clichs you hear time and time again from middle class Tories who don't know the first about left wing wing politics can be more successful economically than the shitshow in the UK. America is a terrible example for the UK and its influence on it has sent it well off path when it comes to politics. 

I know the right wing ethos in the UK well and people there genuinely believe they that left wing = economically unsustainable. Funny how nobody was saying this during the early Blair years when the UK was doing very well. Truth is the British left have been painted as incompetent and weak, but the Tories are going to sell you down the fucking river, end of story. The majority will be poorer, your society will be more unjust and have greater inequality, and your industry will continue to flounder as everyone fights for the scraps of the wealthy rather than be satisfied with ordinary working life.

It has less to do with distance and more to do with casualties/type of combat. Iraq was by no means a large military engagement, particularly when comparing it to wars from the 19th and 20th century. It was a minor war in that it won't bring world powers into a face-off. At most, it will cause instability within the region, not the world.

&gt;If these are your definition of world, surely there is a world peace.

At an international systemic level, the U.S., East Asia, and Europe make the calls. Other regions and their respective states largely do not have anywhere near the required hard (military) or latent powers (economy, population, etc.) to even think of engaging in a serious military campaign that can cause international disruption. On the contrary, it would be completely against their interest to do so (for a multitude of reasons). If Europe, the U.S. and East Asia are at peace with one another, it is virtually guaranteed that the world has relative peace. You're either unaware of willfully ignorant of what any of the hegemonic wars in the 19th and 20th century were like and the death and destruction they caused. 

You're welcome to take a humanitarian ""every one is equal"" and the world is not centered around the U.S., Europe, and East Asia perspective. Geographically, perhaps even morally you may be correct. But if you have even the slightest grasp of international relations, the hegemonic stability theory, etc. you very quickly realize that a world balance (as we have it now) with America at the forefront is substantially better than much of what the world has seen in the past. America is making no imperial effort to take over the whole world or act aggressively against every single state it views as an adversary (as nazi-Germany or imperial Japan did). This should be viewed with some degree of satisfaction, not the nonsensical and futile cynicism (to the tune of Michael Moore) that you're trying to put forward.

465,"&gt; I feel you may have forgotten the whole cold war thing where there were several instances of the world almost going up in nukes. I feel you are forgetting the fact of nuclear weapons in your analysis. The simple fact of their existance severaly curtailed the ability of the two remaining powers to actually engage in armed conflict with each other. Would the cold war have stayed cold if there hadn't been the constant threat of nuclear annihalation? 

I'm in complete agreement with this statement. Nothing I've said is at odds with your suggestion. My point is precisely that the war remained cold due to the fact that both states were powerful enough to create a bi-polar balance. The system, as Mearsheimer suggests, is even safer now that America really holds dominance. There is no one to upset the balance and America isn't trying to be overtly imperialistic. 

America invading latin-American countries, or installing a dictator in Iran is not comparable to an East Asian or European invasion. It does not upset the world balance, at most it causes regional instability.

Here's a post I wrote earlier that better outlines my point. Note that I'm not arguing whether or not America's actions are moral, correct or unfair. I'm taking an academic perspective as to why the unipolar international system is actually beneficial at the moment.

Here it is: 

&gt;If it's kilometers away from home and has nothing to do with your people, surely it must be minor isn't it?

""It has less to do with distance and more to do with casualties/type of combat. Iraq was by no means a large military engagement, particularly when comparing it to wars from the 19th and 20th century. It was a minor war in that it won't bring world powers into a face-off. At most, it will cause instability within the region, not the world. I'm in no way suggesting the lives lost are less valuable or important, I'm merely taking an academic perspective in an effort to explain why the current unipolar (with Europe, and East Asia holding a comfortable balance) system is actually good for the world as whole. I will point to [civilian deaths as a result from battle since 1945  as partial evidence for the system working](http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ourworldindata_wars-after-1946-state-based-battle-death-rate-by-type.png).""


&gt;If these are your definition of world, surely there is a world peace.


""At an international systemic level, the U.S., East Asia, and Europe make the calls. Other regions and their respective states largely do not have anywhere near the required hard (military) or latent powers (economy, population, etc.) to even think of engaging in a serious military campaign that can cause international disruption. On the contrary, it would be completely against their interest to do so (for a multitude of reasons). If Europe, the U.S. and East Asia are at peace with one another, it is virtually guaranteed that the world has relative peace. You're either unaware of willfully ignorant of what any of the hegemonic wars in the 19th and 20th century were like and the death and destruction they caused.""

""You're welcome to take a humanitarian ""every one is equal"" and the world is not centered around the U.S., Europe, and East Asia perspective. Geographically, perhaps even morally you may be correct. But if you have even the slightest grasp of international relations, the hegemonic stability theory, etc. you very quickly realize that a world balance (as we have it now) with America at the forefront is substantially better than much of what the world has seen in the past. America is making no imperial effort to take over the whole world or act aggressively against every single state it views as an adversary (as nazi-Germany or imperial Japan did). This should be viewed with some degree of satisfaction, not the nonsensical and futile cynicism (to the tune of Michael Moore) that you're trying to put forward.""

Although this is less of an issue now, English has really become the lingua franca for international tourism, people specifically working in tourism should really speak it but it's unreasonable to *demand* that other workers do. French in particular, more than any other nationality I've ever come across, really do appreciate at least a token effort at communicating in French even if it is only an opener and most of the communication switches to English. 

Dressing really really badly in the stereotypical way (shorts, fanny pack). Complaining about the food because it's not like how it is in America- not France but I once witnessed an American complain *extremely* loudly about his cappuccino being ""cold"" in Pompeii. It wasn't cold, Americans just make their cappuccinos hotter than Italians; a cappuccino *should* be a temperature suitable for drinking immediately. But telling an Italian that they can't make a proper cappuccino is unlikely to endear you to them. 

Arrogance, I've actually heard Americans abroad comparing this and that to ""back home"" and how much better America is. Being really loud, a complete inability to reduce the volume (far from the only nationality with this issue).

Another big one is expectations of service. Americans often expect a certain level and more precisely a certain *type* of service where the person serving you pretends to be your friend and fawns over you. Many Europeans see that as fake, don't like it, and don't do it. Sometimes Americans then get annoyed about not receiving a certain level and type of service. But you don't need to leave American levels of tips either. 

A general inability to accept that cultural norms are different in different places and that it is incumbent on the visitor to adapt when abroad, not the locals. 

Note most Americans these days are fine and don't embody this but the stereotype is a stereotype for a reason. It's based on a type of American tourist that was more common in the past. Similarly most English tourists aren't lager louts or football hooligans and most Germans  don't aggressively annex land beside foreign swimming pools with their beach towels.

489,"&gt; Why does someone who writes posts this good have such a username? Pretty funny honestly.

I'd be glad to. I absolutely agree, America gets a bad wrap for many of the things its done. But on the whole, I think we've done a lot more good than bad. We are (by far) the largest exporter of humanitarian aid (look at cases like Haiti) and it frustrates me when people attempt to discredit it merely because they (cynically) believe it only serves our interests and that its done for selfish reasons. America has nothing to gain from supporting a small, poor state like Haiti other than the fact that its the morally right thing to do. 

Furthermore, look at things such as the Marshall plan. We quite literally covered all of Germany's WWII reparations so they could pay the back to the likes of Britain and settle that debt. Much of that money went to other European states such as France too. The amount of problems that it has averted in the future cannot possibly be overstated. If it were up to France, Germany would have suffered greatly following WWII the same way it did after WWI (and less deservedly so at the time). American political actors were rational enough to realize that by treating them with a degree of respect and support after the war it would almost certainly avoid any future attempt to re-weaponize and engage in a hegemonic war. Hitler based much of his rhetoric on vengeance, and now there was no vengeance to be had. Today, 70 years later, Germany is a dominant force in Europe and has had no interest in military campaigns or expansion over its neighbors. 

The same goes for Japan, sure one could argue we dropped two atomic bombs but what about after? We helped rebuild the country from scratch, pushing incredible amounts of money into their economic and going so far that the Japanese have named their constitution after Douglas MacArthur, their invader who has incredibly generous and caring towards the Japanese after the end of WWII. 

Ill use one more case, though there are countless examples. America's intervention in Kosovo goes largely unthanked and people like to point to bombing over what the intervention actually stopped and prevented. It pushed for an end to rampant genocide that was surely going to end in success for Milosevic. As C. Hitchens points out, there was no Oil in Kosovo, Israel had no involvement, there were no votes to be gained (actually to the contrary because most of the people saved were Muslim Bosniacks). America (with the help of Europe) quite literally removed a threat to peace in the region, and it did to successfully and without a word of gratitude from much of the surrounding community. Don't even get me started on the short intervention in the first Gulf War that sent Saddam back to his country, defeated and suppressed. 

So, yes. America is by and large a moral actor. I think, with the power the state has amassed since WWII it could've followed similar paths to other hegemonic states in the past and attempted to expand and be far more aggressive than it has been. America made no further effort (after colonial times) to expand to Canada and the same goes for southward expansion. It occurred limitedly and a long time ago. 

The amount of aid we provide for other states, whether for selfish interests or not, is staggering and unmatched. We've, more than once, come to the aid of states (thousands of miles aways) who faced certain demise and virtually turned the situation around for them. This has occurred far more than any American backed coup, etc. 

Hope that outlines my position somewhat clearly. There really are too many examples to point to in just one reddit post but I think if we can put aside the cynicism that many europeans and the international community throw at the U.S. it becomes clear just how much good America has done for the world. I guess people forget/just don't know what the world was like less than a century ago. They take things for granted and ignore the many times a country like America has supported them.

The Brit politicians indeed did jump on the wars started by the US.

&gt;It kills me when Europeans forget that the US is the reason why they aren't calling each other comrade and why they have so many relatively well-funded social programs.

What would have happened had USSR won? Secret prisons? Wire-tapping and control of media? Invasion of countries on false premises? Support of preferred countries and suppression of non-friendly countries? Get the fuck outta here.

Which terrorists are these again? The ones funded by US in Afghanistan or the ones American wars created in 2000s?

Never said it was a favor, but getting something without paying for it is usually a favor. The size of our military does not allow us to do whatever we want. Our economic domination does, the military just allows that to continue. What EU country and/or citizens have been charged with war crimes, violating international law? I wonder why none of them have... probably because America does it for them. Kinda easy to point the finger when you have no hands to get dirty. The EU benefits from bloody American hands (I'm sure BP was happy with what the CIA did on Iran).

They did need America's hand, just like the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Poland and a lot of other countries did when it came time to rebuild.

535,"Since you approached this question properly I understand your opinion. That information is incorrect.
Let us see by dialects and not languages - like all the slav nations were one. That school in Ohrid was the first university here and it was founded by the saints Kliment and Naum Ohridski. They were not Bulgars since they were born, worked and lived in the western regions of Macedonia (Ohrid) and they spoke the dialect there. (Even though they knew Greek and other languages and worked with everyone.) They were schoolars. You can not say that they were Bulgarian. Macedonian is not an offspring of Bulgarian. You can not know for sure, but it seems that it is the other way around to some point. I am saying this because the written form of the languages first started in Ohrid, in Macedonian dialects, from that regions. About the spoken language, everyone spoke different. The schoolars translated Greek and Latin to the Church-slav ""written only"" language, in some form of our dialects. Later on that language took other forms. You can not say that is Bulgarian. Wikipedia is wrong, sorry. It can be in some cases. This is a very sensitive matter. We have a lot of history. You can not say we are madd out of nowhere. The flag has history, it is not copied. The first flag was the original flag of Virgina, the old Macedonian, but that was not approved from Greece. Throughout history we have had more right to the ongoing events but not much was recored in our favor, in favor of our people, our nation. Under the Byzantine, we had different dukeships and occasional kingdoms, like Samuel's. He was ours, yes. The Bulgarian king at that time was named Boris, even thought they say Samuel was theirs also. He was in Ohrid too. He was not Bulgarian. Bulgaria conquered all the land up to Ohrid back then, but that is all theh had in all of history. All their wished claims upon Macedonia are based on that. After that, Constantinopole falled and Otomans came. There were no separate lands then, but the people were. When the Otoman empire was falling, Bulgaria and Greece and Serbia were freed first and due to their access to sea their economy and power strenghtened. Macedonia was last to free itself due to its strategic position in the Balkans. The others already had power and with their religious and military influence and propaganda they didn't allow the Macedonians to form the nation back then. History was taken by them. We were teared apart between them in 1913 after the Balkan wars, with the Bukuresht pact. In the pact it states the the countries: Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria and Albanian will care for the no-man's land (Macedonia) until reviewed 100 years later. The pact was not reviewed in 2013 even thought it has ended. Only the Vardar part, managed to make the country due to the freedom it has given by Yugoslavia. The Macedonians in Yugoslavia were allowed to learn the language and learn about their nation. Greece was the most ruthless of all. They killed and banished the Macedonians that didn't say they were Greek after World War II. A lot of people escaped back then to the Macedonia today.(Part of my family is from there). Bulgarians did the same but they did it less. Their religious propaganda and the inability of Macedonians there to learn Macedononian made them forget. But there are still many Macedonians in both countries that will tell you the same thing I am telling you. The language we use today was codified in 1945. But that language is not much different from the previous one. We gained our freedom with Yugoslavia and completely after that. The neighbours are still going on with their propagandas and they still try to make their dreams of Great Greece, Bulgaria, Albania  come true. That is the sad but true truth. We are a legitimate country with a history older that most of other countries. Our language, land, people and flag have history behind them and are one of the oldest in the world.

**1954 Guatemala** - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Jacob Arbenz in a military coup. Arbenz is replaced with a series of facist dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years. Non of them are democratically elected.

**1959 Haiti**- The U.S. military helps ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier become dictator of Haiti. Not democratically elected

**1961 Ecuador** - The CIA-backed military forces the democratically elected President Jose Velasco to resign. Vice President Carlos Arosemana replaces him; the CIA fills the now vacant vice presidency with its own man. (who is a rightwing nut and is not democratically elected)

**1963 Dominican Republic** - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Juan Bosch in a military coup. The CIA installs a repressive, right-wing junta. (not democratically elected)

**1963 Ecuador** - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows President Arosemana, whose independent (not socialist) policies have become unacceptable to Washington. A military junta assumes command. (not democratically elected)

**1964 Brazil** - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. Puts a millitary junta in power (Not democratically elected) and later it is revealed that the CIA trains the death squads of General Castelo Branco (who is one of the facist dictators US puts in power).

**1965 Dominican Republic**- A popular rebellion breaks out, promising to reinstall Juan Bosch as the country's elected leader. The revolution is crushed when U.S. Marines land to uphold the military regime by force. The CIA directs everything behind the scenes. Openly protect facist dictator that they had put in power AGAINST the wishes of the people.

**1971 Bolivia** - After half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President Juan Torres. In the next two years, dictator Hugo Banzer will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped and executed. (The dictator is not democratically elected either)

**1973 Chile** - The CIA overthrows and assassinates Salvador Allende, Latin America's first democratically elected socialist leader. The CIA replaces Allende with General Augusto Pinochet, who will torture and murder thousands of his own countrymen in a crackdown on labor leaders and the political left. (not democratically elected)

**Between 1973 and 1986 there are many different attempts to put facist dictators in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. But they mainly fail and just leads to civil war without US getting their facist puppet governments.**

**1986 Haiti**- Rising popular revolt in Haiti means that ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier will remain ""President for Life"" only if he has a short one. The U.S., which hates instability in a puppet country, flies the despotic Duvalier to the South of France for a comfortable retirement. The CIA then rigs the upcoming elections in favor of another right-wing military strongman. However, violence keeps the country in political turmoil for another four years. The CIA tries to strengthen the military by creating the National Intelligence Service (SIN), which suppresses popular revolt through torture and assassination. (this does not happen by popular demand or democratic elections)

**1989 Panama** - The U.S. invades Panama to overthrow a dictator of its own making, General Manuel Noriega. Noriega has been on the CIA's payroll since 1966, and has been transporting drugs with the CIA's knowledge since 1972. By the late 80s, Noriega's growing independence and intransigence have angered Washington ... so out he goes. (Noriega was not democratically elected and his removal was not done by democratic means either, just US being US)

**1990 Haiti** - Competing against 10 comparatively wealthy candidates, leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. After only eight months in power, however, the CIA-backed military deposes him and put facist dictators to rule Haiti. (not democratically elected)

**2002 Venezuela** - The CIA attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government of Venezuela. America attempted to put Millitary dictators in power, however, the coup soon unravels when thousands of anti-coup protesters surround the presidential palace demanding Hugo Chavez's reinstatement.

**And this is ONLY what the CIA admits to. They probably have done a lot worse things than that. Most dictators in the world are in power because America. Africa and Asia is full of brutal dictators that are in power because America gave them guns and help. And MAAANY civil wars have started because America removed democratically elected leaders and wantet to put their millitary dictators in power.

China and Russia are two of the largest countries on Earth (with Russia being the largest) That being said, what makes a country isolationist has everything to do with internal policy and nothing to do with geography. I have no idea where you even got the idea that ""vast inland empires tend to become isolated."" The U.S.S.R. wasn't isolationist, it was a closed system. Same goes for China. In both cases it was all about self-sufficiency not some desire to be cut off from the world. Not to mention that China is hardly an inland empire given that it has both an east and a south coast with the vast majority of the population living within 1000 kilometers of said coasts. Otherwise, which other inland empires are you referring to ? The Mongols ? The Greeks under Alexander ? The Romans ? I can't think of even one historic example.

Historically, America was isolationist until about 1941. After that it did the exact opposite. Dragged into war kicking and screaming, 'Murica got a taste for it and decided to just keep going. Now, in case you haven't been paying attention, America reigns supreme over global politics and is the destination of choice for the majority of people looking to get out of their own countries. That might also explain why the U.S. is the leader in so many areas.  Culturally the U.S.A is dominant so their attitude seems to be basically ""When you get something we want, we'll call you.""

578,"I don't know who's giving this gold and upvotes, but for those who don't closely follow history, you need to realize that pretty much all of the above is propaganda.

The sad fact of Latin America is that it has seen a long series of violent coups that put authoritarian regimes in power.  But to hear some people tell it, whenever the government changes power to a U.S.-friendly government, it's ""the CIA"", but whenever it changes to a leftist government, it's ""the people"".  That's propaganda.  In nearly every case, coups were almost entirely internal affairs that outside governments had little or no involvement in.

Once you starting looking past the propaganda and closer at the details, you can see that more clearly.

&gt; 1963 Dominican Republic - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Juan Bosch in a military coup. The CIA installs a repressive, right-wing junta. (not democratically elected)

&gt; 1965 Dominican Republic- A popular rebellion breaks out, promising to reinstall Juan Bosch as the country's elected leader. The revolution is crushed when U.S. Marines land to uphold the military regime by force. The CIA directs everything behind the scenes. Openly protect facist dictator that they had put in power AGAINST the wishes of the people.

So, when a revolt throws a leftist government out of power, it's ""the CIA""; when a revolt tries to install a leftist government, it's ""the people""?  Nonsense.

The facts are rather inconvenient for the leftists here.  The revolt that took Bosch out of power was an internal revolt led by the military.  Bosch was voted into power in an election, but his policies were deeply unpopular, and the military threw him out after less than a year ([Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Bosch#Coup_d.27.C3.A9tat)). Another military coup friendly to Bosch followed, and after a civil war ensued, the U.S. intervened in order to restore stability.  The country held free elections in which Bosch ran again and was defeated.

If all you read was the propaganda above, you'd conclude that the U.S. didn't want a democratically elected President in power and threw him out.  The facts don't support that conclusion.  Not only did the U.S. not throw Bosch out of power, they intervened to impose democratic elections where he was allowed to run as a candidate.

&gt; 2002 Venezuela - The CIA attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government of Venezuela. America attempted to put Millitary dictators in power, however, the coup soon unravels when thousands of anti-coup protesters surround the presidential palace demanding Hugo Chavez's reinstatement.

Ah yes, once again, when anybody attempts to remove a leftist government *of course* it's ""the CIA"", but when anybody imposes leftist policies on the country, it's with the will of ""the people"".  Well, ""the people"" have won in Venezuela - and now they will enjoy the results of the leftist policies the champions of ""the people"" have put in place.

&gt;**1954 Guatemala** - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Jacob Arbenz in a military coup. Arbenz is replaced with a series of facist dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years. Non of them are democratically elected.

&gt;**1959 Haiti**- The U.S. military helps ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier become dictator of Haiti. Not democratically elected

&gt;**1961 Ecuador** - The CIA-backed military forces the democratically elected President Jose Velasco to resign. Vice President Carlos Arosemana replaces him; the CIA fills the now vacant vice presidency with its own man. (who is a rightwing nut and is not democratically elected)

&gt;**1963 Dominican Republic** - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Juan Bosch in a military coup. The CIA installs a repressive, right-wing junta. (not democratically elected)

&gt;**1963 Ecuador** - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows President Arosemana, whose independent (not socialist) policies have become unacceptable to Washington. A military junta assumes command. (not democratically elected)

&gt;**1964 Brazil** - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. Puts a millitary junta in power (Not democratically elected) and later it is revealed that the CIA trains the death squads of General Castelo Branco (who is one of the facist dictators US puts in power).

&gt;**1965 Dominican Republic**- A popular rebellion breaks out, promising to reinstall Juan Bosch as the country's elected leader. The revolution is crushed when U.S. Marines land to uphold the military regime by force. The CIA directs everything behind the scenes. Openly protect facist dictator that they had put in power AGAINST the wishes of the people.

&gt;**1971 Bolivia** - After half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President Juan Torres. In the next two years, dictator Hugo Banzer will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped and executed. (The dictator is not democratically elected either)

&gt;**1973 Chile** - The CIA overthrows and assassinates Salvador Allende, Latin America's first democratically elected socialist leader. The CIA replaces Allende with General Augusto Pinochet, who will torture and murder thousands of his own countrymen in a crackdown on labor leaders and the political left. (not democratically elected)

&gt;**Between 1973 and 1986 there are many different attempts to put facist dictators in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. But they mainly fail and just leads to civil war without US getting their facist puppet governments.**

&gt;**1986 Haiti**- Rising popular revolt in Haiti means that ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier will remain ""President for Life"" only if he has a short one. The U.S., which hates instability in a puppet country, flies the despotic Duvalier to the South of France for a comfortable retirement. The CIA then rigs the upcoming elections in favor of another right-wing military strongman. However, violence keeps the country in political turmoil for another four years. The CIA tries to strengthen the military by creating the National Intelligence Service (SIN), which suppresses popular revolt through torture and assassination. (this does not happen by popular demand or democratic elections)

&gt;**1989 Panama** - The U.S. invades Panama to overthrow a dictator of its own making, General Manuel Noriega. Noriega has been on the CIA's payroll since 1966, and has been transporting drugs with the CIA's knowledge since 1972. By the late 80s, Noriega's growing independence and intransigence have angered Washington ... so out he goes. (Noriega was not democratically elected and his removal was not done by democratic means either, just US being US)

&gt;**1990 Haiti** - Competing against 10 comparatively wealthy candidates, leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. After only eight months in power, however, the CIA-backed military deposes him and put facist dictators to rule Haiti. (not democratically elected)

&gt;**2002 Venezuela** - The CIA attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government of Venezuela. America attempted to put Millitary dictators in power, however, the coup soon unravels when thousands of anti-coup protesters surround the presidential palace demanding Hugo Chavez's reinstatement.

&gt;**And this is ONLY what the CIA admits to. They probably have done a lot worse things than that. Most dictators in the world are in power because America. Africa and Asia is full of brutal dictators that are in power because America gave them guns and help. And MAAANY civil wars have started because America removed democratically elected leaders and wantet to put their millitary dictators in power. The civil war of liberia is an example.**

618,"You really have absolutely no idea how Venezuela, or any South American country works, do you?

I'll put this very simple. South America today, even in the super corrupt and economically stagnant Venezuela, is not divided into the wealthy and absolute poverty. There is a giant and ever-growing middle class in between. The motor of all Latin American economies today and for the past 30 years has been this middle-class that has been rapidly growing and now constitute the majority population in most if not all South American countries. South America is at somewhere like United States in the 1950/60s post-war middle class explosion.

This middle-class grew from the poor masses who existed before, and it continues to grow as more and more poor from every part of society individually raises their standards of living and economic well-being. The policies of Maduro/Chavez have been to limit the growth of the middle class as much as possible by making it increasingly more difficult for the business and industries to perform, starving private and foreign investment, nationalizing performing industries and companies, starving individual enterprise, nationalizing banks, depriving individuals from basic consumer goods and lowering the living standard for all. Maduro/Chavez and indeed Dilma/Kirchner do this because they depend on populist nationalism to retain political control and poor people are much easier to control.

The elite that you espouse hatred towards in Venezuela no longer exists as it once did, the smart ones fled to America and the not-so-smart ones are probably rotting in some jail or have had their capital nationalized. Today, as a result of years of corruption, nepotism and large-scale nationalism of domestic companies and industries, its the party-members who comprise the new economic and political elite. The 'boli-bourgeoisie' as I call them, are the elite class that Venezuelans and indeed you as a self-identified leftist should hate. This is why the leftists in Venezuela supported the opposition leader Capriles in the recent elections and not Maduro.

&gt;Why should America have to babysit Palestine/Israel; why does every president pretend like they are the lady from Dangerous Minds and will reform the dangerous school system and infuse hope? 

Again respectfully not trying to anger you but Israel and Palestine have had plenty of time to resolve and the  longer it goes on the more and more we see that they are unable to bring the fighting to an end. Both Israel and Palestine receive shit tons of money from the international community, Israel receiving weapons and technology from America (And western industrialized countries) so to say that America in particular has no vested interest isnt entirely true. Israel is a big trading partner for America and in this case China any country that does large amount of trading has a vested interest in keeping their trading partners stable and safe. 

I honestly dont see what the big deal is if peace is possible. Dont you think that Israel plays a very large role in a stable middle east? Israel is almost literally stuck between a rock and an Islamic place, their neighbors arent the biggest fans. Wouldnt it be great to get peace and Israelis wont have to worry about the surrounding countries trying to destroy them? Security feels nice.

The third measure was an index based on interview perceptions of corruption (Corruption Perceptions Index or CPI) in that nation.

&gt;&gt;p.257 **... What did we ask? We were asked to formulate our wishes. We said we desired to create in Palestine such conditions, political, economic, and administrative, that in a given time, as short as possible, Palestine should become as Jewish as England is English, or America is American.**

By a Jewish National Home I mean the creation of such conditions that as the country is developed we can pour in a considerable number of immigrants. and finally establish such a society in Palestine that Palestine shall be as Jewish as England is English, or America American.**

&gt;Isnt USA built on the bodies of Natives??

The history of native people in the Americas is very complex, but the simple truth is that the natives were almost totally wiped out by disease long before the US expanded to the west coast. Every country in north and south America,  as well as several european nations bear responsibility for what was done, as natives were brutalized everywhere. Like I said, it is a national disgrace, and one that thankfully is starting to recede into the distant past.

The mass killings of Hindus and Muslims are much more recent though for India. I guess India is only a little better than the most evil places on earth then.

Saying that the modern United States is only a little better than, say, ISIS-land, is one of the most absurd things imaginable.

&gt;India is morally superior to USA. 

To believe that of any nation is to show a lack of understanding of how the world works.

&gt;**Christians in Jerusalem want Jews to stop spitting on them**

http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/christians-in-jerusalem-want-jews-to-stop-spitting-on-them-1.137099

&gt;29 September 2013. Vandals damaged seven vehicles of Palestinian residents of **East Jerusalem, near the Tomb of Simeon the Just scratching them with keys and a screwdriver**, the second incident in a week suspected to be undertaken as revenge attacks on Palestinians for Israel's policy on the West Bank.[100] Two Jewish teenagers were subsequently arrested on suspicion of involvement.[101]

.

&gt;Police arrested **4 Jewish youths**, two identified as Hilltop Youth, in the **act of smashing 15 gravestones in the Christian cemetery near King David's Tomb in Jerusalem** in order to prevent a fully-fledged 'price tag' attack from being carried out.[102]

.

&gt;5 May 2014. A column **outside the Office of the Assembly of Bishops at the Notre Dame Center in East Jerusalem** was smeared with a graffito in **Hebrew:""Death to Arabs and Christians** and all those who hate Israel"".&lt;/[133][134]

.

&gt;7 February 2012 - In Jerusalem, a Jewish-Arab bilingual school, a symbol of coexistence, in which half the students are Jews and half are Arab, and the 11th-century Monastery of the Cross administered by the Greek Orthodox church were defaced with graffiti saying ""Death to Arabs"", ""Kahane was right"" and **""Death to Christians""** as well as ""price tag"". The two incidents, suspected of being 'price tag' attacks carried out by Jewish extremists,[57] were later attributed to two Bedouin youths, who confessed to the acts.[58]

.

&gt;The incident, suspected to be a price tag attack, follows the recent evacuation of Migron, a settlement in the West Bank; among graffiti found: **Jesus is a monkey.**

.

&gt;20 February 2012 - Vandals daubed **""Death to Christianity""**, **""Jesus is dead,""** and **""Mary was a prostitute""** [59] on the Jerusalem Baptist Narkis Street Congregation church, and slashed the tires of several cars parked in the compound. The acts were countersigned by price tag graffiti.[60][61]

.

&gt;3 October 2012 -The entrance to the Church of the Dormition on Mount Zion was sprayed with graffiti that read **""Jesus, son of a bitch**, price tag.""[70]

.

&gt;3 April 2014. The slogan ' **""Only goys [non-Jews] can be driven out of our land,""'** was spray-painted on a wall and the tires of 40 cars were slashed in the **predominantly Christian Israeli village** of Jish in what Elias Elias, head of the Gush Halav Regional Counci, described as 'price tag' damage.[127]

.

&gt;30 May 2013. Jerusalem's Dormition Abbey on Mount Zion was sprayed, for the second time in several months, with graffiti reading **'Jesus is a monkey'**, and the tires of two cars parked there were slashed, apparently in retribution for the dismantling of an illegal outpost, Havat Ma'on.[94]

.


&gt;1 April 2014 The tires of four cars were slashed and on the walls of the Catholic monastery at Deir Rafat village, close to Kibbutz Tzora near Beit Shemesh. The graffiti read ""America is Nazi Germany"", ""Price Tag"", **""Jesus is a monkey""** and **""Mary is a cow.""**[125][126]

.

&gt;9 May 2014. Graffiti reading 'Price tag, King David is for the Jews, **Jesus is garbage'** were sprayed on the walls of the St. George Romanian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem.[136][137]

.

&gt;14 January. 11 vehicles in the Palestinian neighborhood of Beit Safafa, East Jerusalem, had their tires punctured and the cars sprayed with hate graffiti, one referring to a ""demarcation order"", alluding to an order to demolish an illegal settler outpost. Hilltop youth are suspected.[154][155] 26 February. An arson attack on a Greek Orthodox seminary for the study of Christianity next to Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem destroyed the bathroom. The walls were smeared with graffiti, including **""Jesus is a son of a b***h""**, and ""the Redemption of Zion"".[156] The action was defined as a price tag attack by the Arab Joint List party.[157]

724,"Arabs are fine with Jews as long as they live under Arabic rulers and obey their laws. ""Lived harmoniously"" depends on who was sultan in the Ottoman Empire, and some weren't terribly kind to the Jews, but others were fine. The bad blood between the two started to appear when the British started to give the Jews more autonomy.

Unlike your argument, though, you could say the Arabs owned the entire territory first with the Jews in it. When the Ottomans were defeated in WW1, Britain staked a claim and that claim was granted to them by the League of Nations, effectively making the territory British. Then they decided to give it back to the two main groups there as separate countries. The Jews, who had never had a homeland, said yes and took up the offer. The Arabs, who had previously owned all of it, said no, we want it all.

So a better example would be you're Kurdish, living in Iraq. America comes in and defeats Iraq and annexes it. 20 years down the line, they decide to give it up, and while leaving say, hey, how about we make an independent country Kurdland in NE Iraq? The Kurds, who have never had a homeland say yes but the majority of Iraqis are like fuck no, we won't take that offer - we want all our country! The Kurdlanders sign the document that gives them that part of the country, but greater Iraq does not. The Iraqis immediately declare war and are rolled over and defeated and Kurdland claims all of Iraq. Who's land is it? Officially on paper, only NE Iraq is claimed. Kurdland has claimed all of Iraq, so in their eyes, they own all of it. The UN still divides it the same way the US intended and calls the rest of the area occupied territories.

Depending on your point of view, it isn't a very cut and dry situation.",0,0.129898989899,0.272110463796,0.450555555556,0.310417434364,1.1,1.0,329,0.0344827586207,17.3157894737,0.0,0.0
725,"a) I would disagree. I think it's entirely relevant. Of course the Palestinians are responsible for their actions, and the entire blame cannot be placed on the Israelis. But if you are still under occupation after the power occupying you has made a big show of ending the occupation, and in fact in many ways making the occupation more restrictive and onerous (especially with respect to important things like trade, water rights, energy supply, etc.), you're going to get frustrated and look for a more direct solution to your problem. This is why the end of an occupation is generally not a one-sided affair - when an occupying power wishes to end its occupation, it meets with the representatives of the occupied people to work out a comprehensive agreement and reinstate the civilian legal regime that is de facto suspended by military occupation. Which brings us to our next point...

b) I believe your understanding of occupation is incorrect. Your quote of the Hague Regulations actually proves my point, which is why I find it strange that you quote it in defense of your argument! The 'authority of the hostile army' can of course extend to a physical locale where that army is not located. The question concerns the legal regime operative in that locale. The legal regime operative in Gaza is a de facto military legal regime. Israel still maintains final control over the Gazan territory, and can do whatever it wants in that territory, of course bound by the rules of military occupation as expounded in customary international law. It's also important to note that since according to international law occupation does not entail a transfer of sovereignty, [the civilian legal regime of the occupied territory is never de jure suspended](http://lawofwar.org/occupation.htm). Military control does not displace civilian law de jure, but de facto. Hence, Gazans can elect their own officials, live under their own laws, but still be under military occupation, since the final say still lies with Israel.

c) I believe your analogies are incorrect. An occupation only obtains when a military force takes formal legal custody over territory captured in conflict. America did not occupy Iraq in the strict sense of the term in 1991, nor did it occupy germany in the strict sense of the term in 1943. America maintained de facto control over those territories during that time under the customary rules of war, but did not maintain de jure legal power and responsibility until formal possession of the territory was taken (specifically, in the case of World War II, after the instrument of surrender signed by the German army high command and the allied forces command). So, in point of fact, Israel does govern Gaza, but in a very hands-off manner. 

Let me know if you've found any mistakes in my argument! This is an interesting discussion and I'd like to pursue it further with you. ",2,0.145752525253,0.132067726845,0.409063492063,0.259496786177,0.5,0.9,490,0.0528169014085,22.2727272727,0.06,0.123333333333
726,"Well neither... SA was a economic minnow at the time and their really was only a limited amount of economic activity one could extract from the region. It was more Geopolitical, If the Soviets wanted influence in Panama, we wanted to stop their influence in Panama. If the US was interested in Brazil, the Soviet Union wanted to halt our interests in Brazil. The Actual effects,lives,and aspirations of the South American people weren't a factor. It is really bad to say but all South America was to the US and USSR was a space on the geographic chessboard between the Super Powers...It wasn't even a really important one either in comparison to Japan,Turkey,China,Europe, and the Middle East.   

As for Capitalism's inferiority to other systems, well I just have to say its seems to be the only system which has withstood the test of time and crisis. Its ability to crown Super Powers is beyond question and its many forms from Laisse-Faire Capitalism, Mercantilism, to Keynesian Capitalism have proven to be effective means of production in a competitive world.",1,0.145568783069,0.231701069532,0.473214285714,0.218842353153,0.5625,0.6375,187,0.0594059405941,26.7142857143,0.00833333333333,0.583333333333
727,"a) You seem to be changing the subject back to your earlier arguments. So I'm going to go to that.

b) The question now becomes how we define ""authority."" You're saying that because Israel controls some of what goes into Gaza they have de facto authority over it. I disagree because of the aforementioned argument about Iraq and Germany. When I look up a definition of ""authority"" it usually gives me sovereignty.

The Hague convention lists things the occupier may and may not do including collecting taxes, enforcing the law, and so forth. How could Israel collect taxes if their soldiers aren't in Gaza?

I have commonly heard that territory will be considered occupied when it is under the effective control of the foreign army. That clearly is not the case for the majority of Gaza.

If you want to get technical about the laws Gaza was never occupied because since 1948 it has never been part of a state, only occupied by Egypt and then Israel and then no one. So who is Israel supposed to pass the civilian law to?

c) In that case, Israel doesn't have formal legal custody over Gaza, so it's not occupied. I wouldn't say America had de facto control over those countries during those periods either, a blockade is not ""de facto control"" by any definition I have ever heard of the term. 

Can you perhaps provide another example of a country blockading a territory and effectively (but not technically) occupying it?",4,0.0363095238095,0.119148149793,0.36369047619,0.208971157671,0.55,0.55,255,0.0281690140845,17.0,0.0,0.0
728,"As an American we certainly aren't 'winning' in our country either. The US political elite needs to set Russia up as our enemy so they can justify the meddling of the US State Dept(CIA) in Ukraine, to steal resources from the Ukrainian people on behalf of US energy corporations such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, and steal their wealth by the Fed member banks giving out loans through the IMF. Meanwhile Russia is the only country providing protection and humanitarian aid to the million+ Ukrainian refugees.

And our elite also needs to distract from the fact our country is in a rapid state of political, economic, and social decline so that's why the elite need to demonize Russia. If the US experiences or is on the brink of yet another economic collapse the elite could drive us to war so that they can maintain power and control and keep their wealth.

China's incredibly protectionist trade policy combined with the fact that it devalues its currency is fucking the US dead economically.

729,"Yes, I do think America is capable of armed revolution to save itself from a government gone unthinkably horribly wrong. So is Britain. So is any country in the world. All you need is the will to resist and decent street-fighting tactics. No guns allowed? Get a machine shop. Make your own damn guns. Those guns suck? Sneak up behind someone with a better gun, kill them, and take their gun and equipment. Raid supply depots for ammo.

There are a million billion ways to sabotage a government that has become an enemy to its own people. During WWII, the Allies wrote a book on how to fight without fighting, called *Simple Sabotage*. You can hurt your enemy quite well without an ounce of explosives or a single bullet. Give it a look.

As for America, we've got it extra cushy if push comes to shove. We've got shit tons of guns in civilian hands. Hell, one of the likely wake-up calls to a totalitarian take-over would be an attempt to physically remove these weapons en masse. On top of that, our military swears an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Not the President, not Congress, the Constitution. In all likelihood, large segments of the military would defect if ordered to do something outrageous against the American people. Plenty wouldn't, but enough would. You can't crush a revolt with modern military technology and still have a country left to rule. You have to send troops to kick in doors and root out the rebels. You need to patrol constantly so those saboteurs and small bands of troublesome fighters don't come knocking.

In pre-Reagan America, redistribution was about taxing the rich and middle class and providing for the poor (to oversimplify it of course). Taxes and welfare were *targeted* as well. That is, someone who makes x is taxed b, and someone who makes y is taxed c, and anyone who makes less than z qualifies for government assistance. Whereas in France and Germany, for example, it was more about redistribution within social classes. There was less concern with economic justice and redistributing from the rich to the poor, and more concern with rebuilding the nation. Taxes and benefits were more hidden and universal, so it was a lot harder to get angry about them and have a Reagan/Thatcher revolution.

America dominated and occupied the mainland over a couple of centuries, and only in the 20th century did we occupy Hawaii. We occupied Japan after we beat them in the war, same with Korea. We occupied Iraq and Afghanistan after destroying the countries. America gets away with it because it is the mighty superpower.

China dominates and occupies a considerable amount of land that has either never been Chinese or has people there that do not want to live under Chinese rule (see Uighurs, Tibetans, Western half of China). China's influence is extending into waters that are not theirs as they ram Vietnamese boats and fish on coral reefs. China gets away with it because everyone wants their money.

England...well, let's not pretend that England got where it is today just through stiff upper lips. There was a period of the largest empire in the world. Now they occupy North Ireland and Scotland wanted to split away from 'em. England sort of gets away with it but is less influential than either China or America.

Russia just attacked Crimea and Ukraine. Let's repeat that: **Russia attacked Crimea and Ukraine.** Siberia wasn't even Russian until the Russian Empire decided 'hey, see that big land filled with Mongols, Turks, and Siberians? Yeah, ours now'. Russia is a warlike nation run by criminals; we all expect this.

There is a border dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both screaming about land being taken from the other. No one cares.

Syria is in a state where nobody knows who's occupying what because everyone's killing and murdering each other. No one cares, typical Muslims.

North Korea? Yeah, North Korea, again, nobody cares, UN doesn't care to make a big deal about it because North Korea is dangerous.

In fact I'd say a great deal of Europe has benefited enormously from their colonial histories. Moreover European nations were the ones that almost completely destroyed us Jews in the first place, something that took place over two thousand years. Why the hell should we care what Europe has to say? They benefited from stealing Jewish property, slaughtered them in droves, and now that Israel is involved in conflict (that they didn't even start) *now* it's wrong. *Now* the Europeans are shining beacons of human rights (lotta good it's doing them, see refugees pouring into Europe and increasing antisemitism) who protest a rather small, insignificant conflict in a small, not terribly important nation that is distinguished by the fact that it is Jewish. It is neither participating in genocide nor ethnic cleansing and yet people treat it as such. It gets *way* more attention than other far more barbaric countries and yet often categorized with the same visceral hatred.

I strongly dispute the idea that Israel is even occupying anybody. The pulled out of Gaza, which was a huge mistake since the Gazans elected Hamas and started throwing rockets and suicide bombers at them, culminating in a giant wall that, surprise surprise, has cut them off from the rest of the world - Egypt seemed to think it was a great idea as well. The land that the Israelis 'occupied' was land that certain *extremely aggressive warlike people* **lost** when they **were beaten in warfare**.

The civilized world has benefited enormously from a history of aggression, warfare, colonialism, thievery, and brutality, and now that Israel seeks to act the same as any other nation state they are automatically branded as 'naughty people'.

From the article:

&gt;In truth...the United States has never done well on international tests, and they are not good predictors of our national success. Since 1964, when the first such exam was administered to 13-year-olds in 12 countries, America has lagged behind its peers, rarely rising above the middle of the pack and doing particularly poorly in science and math. And yet over these past five decades, that same laggard country has dominated the world of science, technology, research and innovation.

&gt;Consider the same pattern in two other highly innovative countries, Sweden and Israel. Israel ranks first in the world in venture-capital investments as a percentage of GDP; the United States ranks second, and Sweden is sixth, ahead of Great Britain and Germany. These nations do well by most measures of innovation, such as research and development spending and the number of high-tech companies as a share of all public companies. Yet all three countries fare surprisingly poorly in the OECD test rankings. Sweden and Israel performed even worse than the United States on the 2012 assessment, landing overall at 28th and 29th, respectively, among the 34 most-developed economies.",3,0.023,0.212228978089,0.362333333333,0.18435881854,0.75,0.6,197,0.096,21.8888888889,-0.0357142857143,0.447619047619

That's fine, but it's not very useful to look at only the top 5 in the world. Look at the top 100 in any ranking you choose, and the US clearly dominates. 

&gt;Americans pick easier degrees though.

No they don't. And America has much better and a lot more of science/tech R&amp;D than all of Europe, despite having a much lower population. Even if Europeans picked harder degrees, it doesn't mean anything because Europe is still very far behind America. 

&gt;The EU has more Nobel prizes than America and invented things such as radio

So, many countries which collectively have a much higher population, have more of a prize that they themselves initiated? lol, try harder, that's not impressive by any measure. 

&gt;the basis of most of the wireless technologies we use today including wi-fi and mobile phones

sorry, you don't get to take credit for all those things just because of the radio. 

&gt;he world wide web 

Cool. That's really adorable.  America invented the internet. 

America invented and developed a lot more than Europe in all the areas you listed, despite having existed for a much shorter span of time, and having a much smaller population. The US is far ahead of Europe in virtually every area, and is much more influential upon Europe than the reverse. One such example is this site, which you have an account on and use to post funny comments. Others are Google, Facebook, Yahoo among countless others. Among the notable companies, not too many are European,  unsurprisingly. 

 It's okay, though, despite Europe's petty little squabbles and inability to maintain stability, America has been there to civilize the European continent in ways Europeans could never imagine. So it's no wonder that European military members have to rely on America for their training, and much of their equipment, such as fighter jets and missiles. Makes sense that Europe's military and tech industries are basically a joke compared to those of America.  

For example, the Lend Lease Agreement and Marshall Plan helped Europe because it lacked the ability to maintain its own stability. The result is today's Europe, essentially built upon American charity. So the EU of today is basically shaped by American sympathy. That would explain its low geopolitical and economic standing compared to America.

Again we're NOT talking about ancient history, get over it. Most the world are conquered nations. America is a bad example since it's by far one of the newest - not thousands of years old.

&gt;2.Either prove that they were denied their right of self-determination 

I did. Woodrow Wilson's King-Crane Commission report explains this as early as 1918. It refers to Zionism as extreme, and the Zionists as colonists. 

Moreover, the Palestinians were ignored by both the British and the UN. Their interests were denied. How hard is this to understand? Every single British inquiry during the mandate period makes this conclusion.

&gt;3.Europe is a big place. In some places Jews were treated badly, in other places they weren't. It's not my fault your blanket statements are wrong.

You're literally playing semantics here. The fact is Zionism came about due to antiemetic pogroms in Europe. It doesn't matter if it wasn't everywhere in Europe. You're making a moot point again. 

&gt;4.Prove the intent was depopulation.

Well besides the fact that a commission of inquiry stated this and the blatant statements by Israeli leaders saying Palestinians don't exist and their refusal to live with a majority non-Jewish population - its pretty obvious. 

Not to mention the deliberate policy during the war to expel, or scare as many Palestinians out as possible. Following their removal the complete destruction of their village - implying there was never an intent to allow return. Pretty much rejecting the partition. 

You're asking me to prove things that were already proven by Israeli actions. Your job is to dispute it if you disagree.

&gt;5.The very first act of violence in the region was the bus attack in '47? 

Are you just stupid? I was referring to violence following the adoption of the partition resolution... I thought that was clear and obvious. 

The riots and the commissions of inquiry following the riots in 1936-39, along with the inquiry reports from 1929 among other dates prove that Palestinian rights were being ignored. 

&gt;6.Allowing indigenous Jews to return to their homeland has nothing to do with Palestinian self-determination, correct. Why then did you see the UN denied them that right? Not helping them doens't mean hurting them.

See you're characterizing the situation wrongly again. The Jews were colonists/settlers. We're not talking about 2,000 years ago. I'm tired of your weird, unfounded, illogical, remarks about the far far far past. The fact that the UN thought they could impose a solution against the wishes of the vast majority of the inhabitants was the initial wrong. 

You realize that ideology about 2,000 years ago returning is an extreme position, right? You are following an extreme interpretation of the situation that is not in line with current politics or world norms - nor found in serious scholarly work. 

&gt;7.This whole conversation is about ""ancient history,"" you made it about that when you said the Arabs were the ""natives."" 

No this conversation was about 1948 and the mandate period. Your attempts to derail it and make strawman arguments is just really annoying. Rather than debating the content of what I said you get all twisted up over the semantics of the word ""native."" What the hell man? 

You haven't proven anything this entire time. You made uncited assertions that have been debunked. Either respond appropriately or just stop. You've been caught lying already numerous times and your reasoning has been proven to be illogical. You don't even cite anybody or anything from the time period. You're just spouting off personal opinions/beliefs that don't have basis in fact.

I'm talking about the EU, not Europe. If I was talking about Europe things would be even more one-sided as we would have a $24 trillion economy. Also, the EU doesn't compete with America. It crushes it.

&gt;No, America has better science and tech than Europe. So Europe is just making it harder on themselves for no reason, while achieving less. lol

Again you're just blabbering without making any points or providing any citations.

&gt;By number of achievements and discoveries. America soundly beats Europe in this area. You should not try to compare yourself to America in the area of science or technology. Just look at the fact that you're using mostly American tech right now.

The semiconductors we all use today in such things as PCs and TVs were produced using the Czochralski process. Also, you and I are both using the world wide web to have this conversation, which as I have repeatedly pointed out is a European invention.

&gt;America has a lot more science and tech developments and research facilities than Europe, even though Europe has a much larger population and history. Pretty sad that America is already so far ahead of you in such a short period of time. 

Why do you keep using the fact America hasn't been around for very long as a talking point? We've accomplished more than you over the same period of time despite our similar population levels and much smaller pool of resources and space.

&gt;America has more papers than your country.

Not more than the EU however and we have a much higher amount of papers published per capita than you.

&gt;And we control your country anyway lol you're our lapdogs, a puppet state for our hegemony. 

How do you figure this? Please respond this time instead of just blathering on about nothing at all.

&gt;Uh no you don't. By your logic America can take credit for all non American aerospace advancements since it invented flight. You have been a country for thousands of years yet America is ahead of you in flight. LOL 

America didn't invent flight. Dirigibles and zeppelins were around before the Wright brothers, the first airplane was made by Clement Ader, the helicopter was invented by a European and turbojets, which make modern flight possible, were invented by an Italian. Boeing and Airbus compete on more or less the same level (it's slightly in Airbus' favour though) so in what way is America ahead of Europe in flight in any way?

&gt;wow, again you need an entire continent to compare to America.

Yet you think it's fair to compare America, with a population of 330 million, to any single European country, the largest of which has a population of 90 million. Your hypocrisy is staggering.

&gt;This argument you make is silly. America is the global leader in IT and Europeans know America is far ahead of it. Silicon Valley alone is more productive than the entire continent of Europe. 

95% of all smartphone CPUs are produced by ARM Holdings. How is that unproductive? Secondly, you're not the current leader in IT, as you can see in the link below. Thirdly, it's pretty ironic that you chose to name the hub of most of your significant IT technologies 'Silicon' valley seeing as silicon was discovered and isolated by Europeans.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies

&gt;I didnt say it did, but America made a lot more advancements in the area than your country. 

No it didn't. The electromagnet was first improved by Gerrit Moll and electromagnetic induction (arguably the most significant discovery of the 19th century) was discovered first by Michael Faraday, a British scientist. Do you even have the slightest clue what you're talking about here?

&gt;You obviously need to work on your history education. England, France and Spain were all very powerful and very close to the US during its developmental stages.

What do you mean 'very close'? They were separated by a huge ocean and the only time a European power meddled in America's affairs during the 19th century was in the war of 1812, which only stopped after Britain decided it no longer needed to impress sailors from your country into its navy.

&gt;You obviously dont know much about geography either. Europe is bigger than America lol and you are closer to other countries to trade resources with. So you should be ahead, but you Europeans have managed to fall very far behind America in this area as well.

Is this some kind of novelty account? Even a basic google search would tell you that the EU is only 4.5 million Sq. KM while the US alone is 10 million Sq. KM. Secondly, the EU taken together is the largest economic bloc on the planet in terms of both GDP in nominal and in PPP terms as well as the largest manufacturer.

&gt;It's pretty much agreed upon that America dominates the globe in all areas. America is the hegemon and is the best in science and tech, and the geopolitical leader. As such, it has trampled European cultural influence. You Europeans, not creating much cultural content on your own, mostly consume American content. Note that the reverse is not true.

The only cultural medium in which America still enjoys a significant advantage is films. The best-selling books of all time are all European. Europeans also produce a fair number of famous video games, such as Battlefield, Hotline Miami and Grand Theft Auto (the fifth instalment of which is one of the best-selling video games of all time). Even music is dominated by Europeans, despite popular perceptions to the contrary.

You Brits just dont have the know-how or the drive to accomplish things properly when it comes to military matters. So you have to rely on your puppet master, America. It's okay, many other European countries do this as well.

Educate yourself. Four of the top ten companies in the world are European. Two are American.

&gt;America had to step in because Britain couldnt carry its own weight. Britain could barely defend themselves, even with heavy US assistance.

We managed to fend off the Germans at the battle of Britain.

&gt;the Nazis were much more respectable than the British. Your leader churchill was ecstatic that the US entered the war since he knew his country was too weak to even defend itself against Germany. During the cold war, Europe was used as a forward operating base against the USSR. Europe didnt play much of a leadership role and has since been extremely over shadowed by a very superior America. Since we used you, we have become the sole superpower and hegemony. Thanks for being a good little puppet state. Remember your place in the world is to serve American interests. 

It's amazing how you managed to spin a whole paragraph out of this nonsense. Europe was weak and divided during the 20th century due to the amount of wars it had been through. If it hadn't been for that we would have flourished over the same period.

806,"Alright fine it will take a long response but lets look at each example and see if your argument that the U.S. was involved in these countries simply for monetary gain holds any weight. I'll give a quick response to each accusation. Even then it will take 2 parts.

""2002 Venezuela - The CIA attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government of Venezuela. America attempted to put Millitary dictators in power, however, the coup soon unravels when thousands of anti-coup protesters surround the presidential palace demanding Hugo Chavez's reinstatement.""

-- Chavez himself stated that the U.S. was not directly involved and only knew it was going to happen. Huge difference. The absolute facts are that Chavez went from 80% approval to 30% approval from the citizens of Venezuela and that the Venezuelan military moved against him due to the fact that he was moving too far to the left was, in fact, getting support from Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. These opposition groups even went the U.S. to get support. Despite the U.S. being opposed to communism and Castro's regime the U.S. consulate in Venezuela informed Chavez of the imminent coup. The Venezuelans attempted to overthrow Chavez not the CIA.

""1990 Haiti - Competing against 10 comparatively wealthy candidates, leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. After only eight months in power, however, the CIA-backed military deposes him and put facist dictators to rule Haiti. (not democratically elected)""

--Haitian military officers train in the United States so of course the military leaders who overthrew Aristide have a U.S. connection. How do we know the U.S. didn't support the overthrow? The U.S. sent an invasion force to re-install Aristide with Operation Uphold Democracy in September 1994 and in fact the only country to ever recognize the overthrow was the Vatican. Aristide had made promises to go after drug dealers. He had already been the subject of an overthrow before he was even sworn in. These elements and their connections in the Haitian military were the ones who overthrew Aristide not the CIA.

""1989 Panama - The U.S. invades Panama to overthrow a dictator of its own making, General Manuel Noriega. Noriega has been on the CIA's payroll since 1966, and has been transporting drugs with the CIA's knowledge since 1972. By the late 80s, Noriega's growing independence and intransigence have angered Washington ... so out he goes. (Noriega was not democratically elected and his removal was not done by democratic means either, just US being US)""

-- In 1904 the Republic of Panama granted the United States perpetual use of Panamanian land to build the Panama Canal. This canal is of extreme strategic importance to the United States and Panama. It's also a massive source of revenue for Panama. Under the agreement the United States was to build it and have free shipping. In 1979 the U.S. returned control of the canal back to Panama. As the cold war developed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega had successfully suppressed communist groups in this sphere. He was also a paid informant and the U.S. turned a blind eye to his drug involvement due to him suppressing communist elements. CIA head George Bush had knowledge of this involvement. In the mid 1980's Noriega made a fatal error in that he began to drift towards the Soviet Union. The final straw came in 1989 when the Panamanian people voted Noriega out of office but he refused to step down. He suppressed several uprisings and this is when the U.S. re-garrisoned their canal zone positions and forcibly removed Noriega. The U.S. didn't remove Noriega so they could make money- they removed him because he was drifting towards Soviet influence while sitting on top of the strategically important Panama Canal.

""1986 Haiti- Rising popular revolt in Haiti means that ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier will remain ""President for Life"" only if he has a short one. The U.S., which hates instability in a puppet country, flies the despotic Duvalier to the South of France for a comfortable retirement. The CIA then rigs the upcoming elections in favor of another right-wing military strongman. However, violence keeps the country in political turmoil for another four years. The CIA tries to strengthen the military by creating the National Intelligence Service (SIN), which suppresses popular revolt through torture and assassination. (this does not happen by popular demand or democratic elections)""

--The Haitians were the ones who overthrew ""Baby Doc"" but before he left for France he set up the 6-member National Governing Council (CNG), under the leadership of Army Commander Henri Namphy. This affiliation with 
""Baby Doc"" upset the Haitians. ""Baby Doc"" had his own secret service called ""Tonton Macoutes"" which was known to suppress ""Baby Docs"" political opponents and had a brutal reputation. Reagan had implored ""Baby Doc"" to not follow the violent footsteps of his father and upon his ouster the U.S. donated 1 million a year start the National Intelligence Service to replace the ""Tonton Macoutes"" and to also assist in the U.S. drug war. The organisation ended up not following this policy and the U.S. pulled its support. A far cry from the accusation that the U.S. was involved to make money.

""1973 Chile - The CIA overthrows and assassinates Salvador Allende, Latin America's first democratically elected socialist leader. The CIA replaces Allende with General Augusto Pinochet, who will torture and murder thousands of his own countrymen in a crackdown on labor leaders and the political left. (not democratically elected)""

-- Once again this post is filled with half truths, lies, and is absolutely ignoring the Soviet Unions involvement in the western hemisphere and the U.S. policy in opposing it. You will find nowhere in any source that the CIA assassinated Salvador Allende. Allende killed himself with an AK-47 that was given to him by none other than dictator Fidel Castro himself.

&gt;However I came to the conclusion personally that the moment another third parties life could be put in danger because you don't feel good about something or it doesn't fit your code you are imperiling others by not acting accordingly.

1. Here we come to the problem of morality. Do we ""do good"" because it enriches us or because of something larger than us? This is a question each of us has to answer for ourselves and repeatedly through out life. I can't answer for you. I can only say that this isn't about me.

&gt;I believe we are fighting a war with peaple who don't fight traditional warfare, they by their very nature as terrorists target civilians

This is pure propaganda. I'm sorry but you are a victim of it. Here's why.

1. Bush's propaganda started the WAR on terror. However terrorism is a politicizing issue. A civil issue. He led you, with this lie, into WAR in iraq and afganistan. Were you fighting terrorists? nope! you were fighting the mujahadin and sadaam's army! Because terrorists don't exactly have armies dude! Why do you still cling to the lie? You will never get rid of terror by going to war with the ""other side"" this is what fuels terror, not destroys it. America being in the middle east has done a lot more to inspire terror than suppress it. 

2. It's not ""by nature"" Jessuz! What do you think terrorists are? A separate species? You are dehumanizing these people so that you can justify torture man! I've already shown you extremism and terror doesn't spring by itself man! If terrorists had an army, there'd be war. Terrorism is what desperate/brainwashed/etc. people resort to when they rebel against *society* and institutions. When they are fighting something that dwarfs them. You know what's hilarious? Your whole justification for torture: **THIS IS EXACTLY THE JUSTIFICATION THAT TERRORIST HAVE FOR TERROR**. That it's about the greater good and that the means justify the ends. What is torture, if not terrorism? literally man. You terrorize people into ""giving you info"". 

Look take away propaganda and the basis of all your arguments disappear. You are advocating that which you hate man: the use of terror!

I'm sorry you're downvoted. I'm really not the one downvoting you. But man, your stance if very twisted and the result of brainwashing IMO. You treat terrorists as a separate  species.

Ever since we lost Iran we've played a game. We sold guns to Iran to bring them closer to us and give them power. But the devil's deals don't last, so we gave guns and sarin gas to Iraq to have them start a war with Iran. This severely damaged Iran's infrastructure making the sanctions we imposed more damaging.

Then we saw Iraq had too much power when they invaded Kuwait, so we cut them down, but waited to completely destroy the regime.

Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, we fund the rebel Taliban to take over and give them guns to fight the Soviets and ruling pro Soviet government. Once they win the war, America waits until the time comes.

Then there was more of a targeted one that effectively boiled down to""You British people are all racist, none of us arabs like you, your countries think they can control us or work with us but we don't want to even know you. America tries to tell us what to do and we just go yeah yeah, but secretly we all hate them. ""

There were a few more of these rants but that's the rough gist of the mindset, i mean being in the UK is only for study but still every time i debated it in the manner i was raised - that we can't live life hating people who have done nothing to us, regardless of what others like them have done. 

But every time a topic like this approaches conversation, I am always shocked at the amount of prejudice and bigotry put on display. I have seen similar behavior before but only from the more hardline nations, people from secular or shia nations tend to have more of a relaxed attitude to others which is just strange. 

That said I'd assume it's the culture, from what i can tell the middle easts hardline leaders commonly push this mindset on people, possibly for fear of the westernization that has existed in some war torn places.

The only thing to be decided was how long it would take, and if Germany could fight long and devastatingly enough to get force the Allies into more favourable armistice and peace terms (which obviously wasn't going to work too well since the Soviets refused to accept peace and the other Allied powers were very reluctant to as well since it hadn't worked too well 20 years previously).

The 3 decisive battles which ""won"" the war were El Alamein (Britain-Australia/Germany-Italy) which allowed the Allies to control the Mediterranean, cut off some of the Axis oil supplies from North Africa and to easily invade a weak Italy, Stalingrad (Soviets/Germany-Italy-Romania) in which a large chunk (almost 1,000,000) of the Axis's best soldiers, generals, and equipment were killed or captured, and the Battle of Britain (Britain-Canada/Germany-Italy) where their best pilots and the majority of their air force were captured, killed and destroyed.

America was instrumental in ending the war quicker however, in the defeat of Japan (which is really irrelevant to the European war, but was probably the main objective of the US anyway), and in funding and supplying the rest of the Allies.

America did not defeat the Soviet Union by economics. The Soviet Union defeated itself with a severely dysfunctional method of governance and a population (at home and in the Warsaw Pact States) that was just tired of socialism, which had not resulted in anything like the success of the west. America's contributions to the disintegration were not inconsiderable, but they were not decisive either. They also did not do a regime change. Yeltsin was the incompetent President (or whatever the equivalent was) of the Russian SFSR, and the only natural successor to Gorbachev.

This idea that America wants Russia to be scary so they can keep NATO together is nothing but a conspiracy theory of the sort that is currently being peddled in Russia itself: America is manipulating us into doing bad things to make Europe go against us.

They can raise any sanctions they like against Russia. It's not going to destroy Russia, nor effect regime change, any more than the sanctions against Iran or North Korea have done so. America happily destroys its enemies when it gets the chance. When it doesn't, it's because it's too difficult or unrealistic to do so.

In my view, Iran does not necessarily want to build a nuke, but they want the infrastructure to be able to develop one. I think they could do it if they really, really wanted to.

---

Gerald Allah-Ompolo, a postgraduate student studying in Chongqing, is appealing for support after being arrested and charged for defending himself and his girlfriend from a gang of racially motivated attackers.

Gerald says he chose to study in the southwestern megacity to get away from cities full of expats and experience more of the country, but that experience turned sour on August 17 last year when he and his girlfriend where attacked by a group of seven men and women who targeted them simply because of Gerald's skin color and the fact that he had a Chinese girlfriend.

After striking one of their attackers in self-defense, Gerald was arrest and charged and his life became ""a living hell."" Gerald says CCTV footage from the scene could easily exonerate him but he, his lawyers and the Congolese embassy have all been denied access to the film. 

Read Gerald's story below; if you agree he's been wronged, you can sign a petition to the Chongqing Municipal Police that he and his supporters have initiated here. 

Gerald Allah-Ompolo is the Congolese son of a doctor and customs official from Brazzaville. When he was at school he enjoyed literature and had dreams of being a judge. He studied Law in Brazzaville, before moving to China 7 years ago, to study to be a legal translator. He first went to Beijing and fell in love with the country, before deciding he wanted to study in a place with fewer foreigners, so he could get a deeper understanding of China. 4 years ago he moved to Chongqing in China, where he was drawn to the local culture, a year later he met his girlfriend and things have been going very well, excepting an incident on 17th August 2014.

Gerald and his girlfriend had been out in the centre of Chongqing, Jiefangbei, on an evening and were approached by a hostile group of 7 people (4 males and 3 females). The group were upset that his girlfriend is Chinese and that he is black, and started to verbally abuse the two of them with xenophobic and racist abuse. His girlfriend verbally defended them both by saying he is black, but he is still a person and as a result was physically attacked by the group. She was firstly punched by one of the male attackers and then grabbed by the throat by another male. Gerald tried to pull the attackers off his girlfriend and was assaulted in the process, but was successful in putting himself between her and the attackers. He managed to shield his girlfriend as she tried to flee through a door next to where the incident took place, but was struck repeatedly on the back by what he believed to be a metal object, unfortunately she couldnt find an escape route through the building and was forced to again exit the same door she had previously entered, where they were both attacked again by the group.

During the second phase of the attack there were two people assaulting Gerald and his girlfriend, while another two people tried to separate the attackers from the couple. This time, Gerald was able to help his girlfriend escape and she went to retrieve the police for assistance. Whilst this was happening a bystander decided to involve himself in the attack as one of the original attackers went to fetch a bottle to use as a weapon. Whilst being held by one attacker and repeatedly struck by another, Gerald saw the third approaching, with the bottle in his hand, and struck one of the attackers with a single blow, in self-defence. This is after he had sustained countless blows to his body, from multiple directions.

The police arrived on the scene, shortly after. Gerald went to the police station to give a statement on his attack, along with the attackers. After giving his statement he was asked to stay in a holding area, while the police took statements from the attackers. Gerald was shocked to find that he was arrested after his wait. He was held in detention for 2 weeks without understanding the charges, until the Congolese Embassy became involved in the incident, paying the 30,000RMB (approximately $4,800) bail that had been set by the police. It was at this point that he was told that the attacker he struck had needed hospital treatment following the single blow Gerald had thrown.

Following his release Gerald has said that his life has turned into a living hell. His university classes have been suspended, where he has been studying for his Masters, he is unable to work and so has no money available, subsequently he has had to vacate his apartment as he cannot pay the rent, all of which is compounded by the fact he cannot leave the country as his passport has been confiscated by the police.

This may already sound like particularly unfair treatment, but the story takes a turn for the worse. After his release Gerald set about trying to vindicate himself, by trying to recover CCTV footage from the 4 security cameras that captured the incident. He was told by the local security that the police had come to collect footage from 3 cameras, but no footage has been shown to him from them. A local bar had a camera that captured footage from around 20 meters away, showing the attackers grabbing his girlfriend by the throat and striking her, along with the blow that Gerald struck his attackers with, which Gerald was able to view at the police station, but which hasnt been released to him or his embassy, despite request from both to do so. Although the security company stated they released other footage to the police, when questioned they have said that there is no other footage. The matter has now been handed over to the court to handle the matter.

Gerald has been told that he will have to appear in court on the 19th of May, to face his attackers, who are demanding 700,000RMB (around $112,000) in damages for the incident and have refused Geralds requests to meet with them to negotiate the case. The damages are supposed to cover the expenses and lost earnings of the attacker that was struck by Gerald, but he has been given neither receipts nor evidence to corroborate the amount that they have arrived at. Gerald has been made to feel even more suspicious of the amount that is being demanded as it includes a figure of 15,000RMB (more than $2,400) for transport, in a city where a taxi ride from one end of the city to the other costs around 30RMB, which would account for almost 9 months of travelling every day from one edge of the city to the other. The amount in damages is the equivalent of 2 houses in the city and he says he has no means of paying it, either through his own finances (which have been exhausted), his government or family.

The incident is difficult to be looked at in isolation with Chongqing having less than 0.1% foreign residents, with few but the very newest arrivals not knowing of a fellow foreigner who has been attacked, with skin tone seeming to play a factor in the incidence and intensity of the hostilities in question. Around a month prior to the racist attack on Gerald another African resident of Chongqing was set-upon by a group of Chinese attackers. George Ambe, from Cameroon was a singer and DJ in a club in Chongqing. After performing one night in June last year, he was approached by a girl, who asked to take a photo with him, to which he obliged. When the girl posted the picture on the Chinese social media app Weixin (Wechat) her boyfriend became incensed and went about tracking down George. On an evening during the World Cup, whilst out watching a match with friends, the boyfriend of the girl who photographed him and 9 others entered the bar where George was watching a game. George tried to escape the attack, but despite running from his attackers, he was pursued and stabbed in the street outside the bar, dying at the scene from his injuries. His body was left exposed in the street by the police, being photographed by onlookers who hadnt intervened in the attack and spread images of his prostrate body on the same social media that had led to his attackers ire and ability to track him down. Georges wife and daughter are still living in Chongqing, but were not offered any compensation by the 3 attackers, who had come forward in relation to the murder of their husband and father.

These two, potentially, racially motivated events, with the suspicion of police impropriety in the handling of evidence suggest a degree of bias if not racism in the institutions along with the local community. Occasionally stories break on social media, but still reporting them outside the country can be a risky prospect for foreigners and Chinese alike, with large scale surveillance on social media making the risk of discovery even greater.

Many of the African and African American community in Chongqing are ambivalent and have chosen to hide away, which has been more the approach that Gerald has taken since his incident. However, there are many in the local community that have taken to social media to report his plight and gain media attention. In the last week his case has been so widespread across social media that journalists from Africa, France and America are trying to interview him and gain further insight into the case. Gerald has said that he only wants the police to release to him, his lawyer or his embassy, the evidence that is being used to incriminate him and should also be able to exonerate him, along with any evidence that would corroborate the figure of compensation sought, alongside a commitment to take action against the perpetrators of the attack against the couple. A large proportion of the foreign community in Chongqing will be going to the court on the 19th May to offer support to Gerald, a much loved member of the local football team, the foreign and local community alike.",1,0.0606195481195,0.230225295138,0.3034999285,0.268034972759,1.45,0.95,1720,0.0316326530612,30.7142857143,0.0111111111111,0.211111111111

Israel is a small fucking country and has a goal of being majority Jewish culture. Why shouldn't they be entitled to that?

America arrested a 14 year old boy and sent him to Guantanamo because he owned a Casio watch.

If a random young kid who owns a watch is considered a prisoner of war then at least Journalists and aid workers make sense.

It is well known that the US use aid workers for spying and killing people. Even if the US government said they will stop doing it when media found out ( http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/20/white-house-says-cia-will-stop-using-vaccination-programs-as-cover-for/ ) does not mean that the US government have actually stopped doing it.

America also burns people alive with bombs, America tortured people to death in Guantanamo and tried to cover it up by calling it ""suicides"" (as was later revealed in a report).

[William Astore, America's Mutant Military](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175998/tomgram%3A_william_astore%2C_america%27s_mutant_military/#more)

Much of our military today remains structured to meet and defeat a Soviet threat that long ago ceased to exist.  (Occasional sparring matches with Vladimir Putins Russia in and around Ukraine do not add up to the heated rumbles in the jungle we fought with the Soviet leaders of yesteryear.)  And its not just a matter of weaponry.  Our military hierarchy remains wildly and unsustainably top-heavy, with a Cold War-style cupboard of generals and admirals, as if we were still stockpiling brass in case of another world war and a further expansion of what is already uncontestably the largest military on the planet.  If you had asked me in 1990 what the U.S. military would look like in 2015, the one thing I wouldnt have guessed was that, in its force structure, it would look basically the same. 

This persistence of such Cold War structures and the thinking that goes with them is a vivid illustration of military inertia, the plodding last-war conservatism that is a common enough phenomenon in military history.  Its also a reminder that the military-industrial-congressional-complex that President Dwight Eisenhower first warned us about in 1961 remains in expansion mode more than half a century later, with its taste for business as usual (meaning, among other things, wildly expensive weapons systems).  Above all, though, its an illustration of something far more disturbing: the failure of democratic America to seize the possibility of a less militarized world.

Today, its hard to recapture the heady optimism of 1990, the idea that this country, as after any war, might at least begin to take steps to demobilize, however modestly, to become a more peaceable land.  Thats why 1990 should be considered the high-water mark of the U.S. military.  At that moment, we were poised on the brink of a new normalcy -- and then it all began to go wrong.  To understand how, its important to see not just what remained the same, but also what began to change and just how we ended up with todays mutant military.

4. Iran is opposed to Israel existing (at least in any form resembling the current one), and does not recognise Israel. It also sponsors Hezbollah and Hamas, which frequently fight Israel.
5. Iran is opposed to Saudi Arabia, which a lot of people hate for various reasons, particularly its hardline Sunni Islamism. Iran is, however, a theocratic Shiite Islam state, so it's a bit weird.
5. Iranian immigrants are generally well-educated and good citizens. (They're also a lot more supportive of the Shah and generally oppose the regime.)

6. Just good old fashioned shilling and vote manipulation.

""A multidimensional scaling plot placed six of the seven Jewish populations in a relatively tight cluster that was interspersed with Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations, including Palestinians and Syrians. Pairwise differentiation tests further indicated that these Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations were not statistically different. **The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population**""

Even if your source was right, 10% of Jews converted and joined the Jewish people. How does that invalidate the entire Jewish people's connection to Palestine? Answer: it doesn't.

Welfare may make some aspects of becoming a jihadist easier. It could provide people with more free time to study the teachings of radical clerics. It could also assist in some of the travel costs. But it's possible the money could be sourced from other places such as shady charity organisations and unknowing family members.

I don't think you have shown a strong causal link between welfare and jihad, in fact you've barely demonstrated a correlation. 

With respects to ISIS and anti-western propaganda. As I'm sure you know, ISIS is an offshoot of Al Qaeda's Iraq branch. So one should expect anti-western propaganda given their pedigree. This has increased in frequency with the entry of western and regional powers into the conflict. Al Qaeda was created largely as a reaction to the close relationship between 'heretical' Arab states and America, so the joint aerial campaign must annoy ISIS to no end.

In any event, my main point was that young men who join ISIS and Al-Nusra don't see themselves as evil. These young men left europe driven by a confessionalistic passion to defend their fellow Sunnis. They aren't blowing up buses in downtown Copenhagen, they're manning the frontlines of a war they see as protecting their co-religious. I don't see how you can discourage people empowered by such righteousness with solutions such as suspending welfare payments or other simple solutions.

One of the reasons I think ISIS has been so much more successful in recruiting than Al Qaeda is that ISIS has a far more visceral call to arms. Al Qaeda dealt in abstractions in explaining how America was oppressing muslims around the world. It was a very esoteric argument that only found very few supporters amongst muslims.

1015,"You are missing the point as thoroughly as a hellfire missile homing on a wedding procession. I am not commenting on the article. I am commenting on your naive hypocrisy. I think Mrs Tzarnayev's reaction is perfectly understandable. To me, as a human being, it is quite understandable, that a heartbroken woman who had just lost her most precious thing in the world - her sons, would lash out at those she blames for her sons' demise. What kind of mother would she be had she reacted differently? 

Also, there is no justification to what Mr. Tzarnaev did. By attacking innocent civilians he has shown that he is no better than those against whom he is fighting. As far as I am concerned, he deserves to burn. I would have applauded him, however, had he instead enlisted, and, in an opportune moment, fragged a barrack full of marines. That would have been a manly act of a warrior. Certainly infinitely manlier than blowing people to bits from stratosphere from a remote controlled plane because in a real firefight american soldiers can get hurt. Do you know what's the difference between a hardcore islamist and a pregnant woman on a thermal imaging camera? There is none. A soldier on the ground can be more discriminating, he see the difference, but a soldier on the ground is a sitting duck. We can't have that, can we? Americans think that america has a moral high ground. You are wrong. America simply has better weapons. America is a living proof that might makes right.

So let me refresh your memory. You weep for the victims of the marathon bombing. Do they deserve your tears? Certainly, every slaughtered civilian does. 

You say:

&gt; Those people died in terrible pain. Not with dignity or having the ability to say good bye to any kid they had or hug there friends and family

Thousands of middle eastern civvies died in terrible pain so that american armed forces (that shouldn't have been there in the first place) could attack islamists from the safety of remote control bunkers. Do you think they never existed because their deaths were not reported on the morning news? Their hopes, dreams, and plans were extinguished just as thoroughly and as brutally, as that of the victims of the boston bombing. They also never had a chance to say good bye to their loved ones (guess what, middle eastern people can love too) because a missile blast turns human flesh into mist in a fraction of a second. Don't be a hypocrite, shed a tear for them too.

Except there never has been a state called palestine. It isn't like someone walks up to France and says, ""Hey, you're not a state so I'm gonna take this."" The land was contested between Israel and Jordan, not imaginary Palestine. You are trying to use the modern day desire for a palestinian state to somehow imply that any actions taken under the reality of there not having been a palestinian state in the past are invalid. This just isn't how it works. You can't say today there is a country called America so anything anyone did before there was an America is a violation of American rights. Palesitne does not exist. It is a modern invention contrived to dispute Israeli land but with the sole intention of removing as much of the Jewish presence from Israel as possible.

&gt;Jordan had more claim than Israel because Jordan gave citizenship to the people of Palestine.

That is some messed up logic. They had more right to take the land because after they took it they offered citizenship to the people there? OK, then East Jerusalem is no longer an issue since Israel offered citizenship to everyone there after reunification. Agreed?

And to be clear, most of the large settlements that people are complaining about and expanding aren't displacing anyone. In fact, some of them, like the Etzion block were inhabited by Jews before 1948 and then they were forcibly removed by the invading arab armies, so to say they are illegal settlements on palestinian land is a complete BS. The land was bought by Israelis long before the war and they have simply reclaimed it.

You talk about palestinian rights but what about the right of a nation to defend itself? That is what Israel did in 1967. I have no sympathy for people who try to eradicate a country again and again and continue to fail all while crying about being the victim. They tried to wipe out the Jews and they lost.

1032,"&gt;poverty and lack of education are responsible for violence in the middle east.

To play the devil's advocate, one could argue that the poverty and lack of education in the middle east are a *result* of Islam. You're cutting out half of your labor force simply by forcing women to stay in the homes. They're not even *allowed* to go to school in many cases. And could you imagine being a boy in school and having to deal with being raped by old men on a regular basis? Or being a woman and not being allowed to show your face in public? Or not even being *allowed* to be in public without being accompanied by a male family member? These things impact more than just social structure.

To counter your argument, let's look at successful Arab countries. Obviously, Saudi Arabia comes to mind immediately, as they're considered a high-income earning country and the only middle-eastern country in the G-20. They continue to rape, stone, behead, hang, lash, and humiliate for crimes as silly as saying a dead guy's name out loud (sounds a little like Voldemort) or drawing a picture of him. These punishments are handed down from the royal families, too, not some impoverished slumlord. And these are a direct result of sharia law, as is the funding of the 9/11 attacks on the United States, and I'm sure plenty of other terror attacks throughout Europe and the Middle East.

Qatar is another good example. Where else in the world in kidnapping and slave-labor (or at the very least, exploitation of migrant workers) considered to be an acceptable practice? Once again, this isn't something that the citizens just decided to do because they're poor and uneducated...this came from the wealthy people who are attempting to carry out an attempt to purge their land of anybody who opposes their faith just like their shitty prophet did 1500 years ago. Many of these guys even have western educations. It's a fanatical religion. Not saying *all* Muslims are fanatics, but undeniably more-so than any other religion right now.

In my opinion, senseless crime like gang crimes, murder, or burglary in the inner-city North America is the result of poverty and lack of education. Poverty and lack of education in the middle east is the result of repressive sharia law, but the terror is not being fronted by the poor, uneducated people. It's being fronted by the super-rich muslims who have a diluted vision of how everyone should live. Point being, even if you *can* find a significant link between poverty and terror in the Middle East, I will argue day and night that the poverty and lack of education is attributed mainly to repression and sharia law.",0,0.0549338924964,0.275678311505,0.424188949939,0.265486652293,1.14,0.95,468,0.03663003663,20.347826087,0.0,0.0

It is a modern invention contrived to dispute Israeli land but with the sole intention of removing as much of the Jewish presence from Israel as possible.

The state of Palestine is irrelevant. All states are irrelevant. The only thing that matters are the rights and welfare of human beings (who all are equal in terms of value and rights). The desire for a palestinian state is based on the desire for rights for 'palestinians' (the people who live in the areas that we refer to as Judea and Samaria/West Bank and the Gaza strip). They are people. It does not matter whether or not the Mandate of Palestine was a political entity, or whether the Sanjak of Jerusalem was sovereign, etcetera. The people of Palestine are the reason why the state is relevant. If Israel offered the Palestinians rights and annexed them then there would be no need for the State of Palestine. If Jordan offered the Palestinians rights and annexed them then there would be no need for the State of Palestine. Neither of these have happened for decades, which is why there need to be a palestinian state. If Israel wants to offer an alternative route for palestinians to have human rights then they can present it. So far Israel has blocked all paths, and the most realistic path right now is a two state solution.

Israel isn't allowing the palestinians to have rights, which is why Israeli settlement growth is illegitimate. You can't force people to be stateless and deprive them of rights, and then say that your expansionism is legitimate because the people are stateless and thus have no rights. This is despicable that you are pursuing this line of argument. 


&gt; That is some messed up logic. They had more right to take the land because after they took it they offered citizenship to the people there?

Yes, because you aren't violating people's rights. You are hurting a competitor state, but that is vastly less important than the rights of human beings, which are the whole point of creating states in the first place. If you conquer a foreign nation, but then give all the people full rights and citizenship then its not really a problem morally. 


&gt; OK, then East Jerusalem is no longer an issue since Israel offered citizenship to everyone there after reunification. Agreed?

The problem with East Jerusalem is that Israel took it while denying the Palestinian people their rights. They keep people occupied and then strip off choice bits of territory that they want while denying any right of the foreign people. If Israel recognized the Palestinian people's rights then there would be no problem in them taking over Jerusalem. What is unacceptable is what is happening right now, which is Israel explicitly calling itself a Jewish state, oppressing the Palestinian people, and then taking a few sections of land populated by Palestinians for itself. That is unacceptable. 


&gt; You talk about palestinian rights but what about the right of a nation to defend itself? That is what Israel did in 1967. I have no sympathy for people who try to eradicate a country again and again and continue to fail all while crying about being the victim. They tried to wipe out the Jews and they lost.

I don't even know where to start here. A) The 1967 war was a first and foremost a war between Egypt and Israel. Jordan was tangentially related. The Palestinians even less so. B) It was not a war of eradication of Jews. It wasn't even started by Arabs. Israel launched a 'pre-emptive strike' and wiped out the entire Egyptian airforce while it was on the ground. Thats how the war started. 

&gt; Time to admit defeat and head back to Jordan, since, as you admit, they are Jordanian, given citizenship by Jordan,

WTF is this shit. No, they should not go to Jordan. I never said they were 'Jordanian'. They are palestinian, they live in the Palestinian territories. If Jordan or Israel wants to annex them I am okay with that, but that does not mean that they need to have their rights deprived because Jordan loses a war. You are sick man. Please reconsider your system of morality. I am sure that you are troubled by what you are saying. 

&gt; at least until Jordan revokes it again to create more refugees on the books.

Jordan gives its entire palestinian population (60% of the population of Jordan) citizenship. You tried to make a cute point but you are completely factually wrong and your ignorance about this topic is glaring.

Ignoring their systematic attacks on Israeli civilians they are horrible tot heir own people. Women, gays, atheists, and anyone who opposes the regime are subject to imprisonment, torture, and murder.

Without talking about the specific claims, let me say that I do not support the palestinian leadership. I don't have to like them or endorse any of their laws etcetera. I can like Israeli society much more than Palestinian society. I personally have been to both Israel and Palestine and would much prefer to live in Israel. This isnt a popularity contest. The Israel-Palestinian conflict isnt about which country is better. We aren't voting one country off the island. We are talking about one specific issue which is whether the Palestinians should be allowed to have citizenship in a state, like the other 7 billion people on planet earth, as demanded by the entire world.

Israel can do all the military bombings and police actions that it wants. It cannot deprive people of basic human rights and deprive them of a state. This situation has happened countless times in human history, with Algeria-France, Ireland-UK, US-BritishEmpire, Vietnam-France, Tamils-SriLanka, etcetera. You need to give people human rights.

When you push two disparate cultures together, with one culture noticeably needing more assistance and aid, you get resentment.  Especially since poverty and the psychological scarring stemming from a violent background often lead to crime.

America has these right-wing politics because there are a lot of issues inherent in accepting immigrants into your country (or absorbing any underprivileged group - see: slavery)  People can go either way - they can be accepting and see it as a good thing that we're helping out underprivileged people from other countries, or they can see it as an unnecessary and costly drain on an already overburdened system.  It's very polarizing and it's easy to see where people develop these views that these *other* people coming into the country are what's ruining the good stuff going on.  

America has dealt with wave after wave of immigration, frequently from places that aren't as economically stable, and the expectation is that because they have land and room they should be able to just absorb them.  It doesn't really work that way, as properly processing these people requires time and money, and an upfront drain on the economy, that sheer landmass doesn't allow for.  It needs the infrastructure that people have built.  A lower population density does not mean a greater infrastructure or capacity.  So problems arise and with it, racism.

1112,"Some thoughts

1) China actually took back Paracel islands decades ago, killing some Vietnamese occupiers. Xi is not more assertive than Mao or Deng were. He has been open to making peace with India and is definitely a lot more ""open-minded"" on Taiwan. The rest of the world is simply more sensitive to the same assertiveness China has always had.

2) China has been settling borders for a long time now, with long-running discussions from 1950 through 1991 and ongoing peaceful discussions with Bhutan. It's just that Vietnam and the Philippines have never really been at the negotiating table, whereas Malaysia has and therefore has refused to align with the other two.

3) If you're saying China is being more assertive because the US is being increasingly obnoxious and hypocritical I'd agree. China basically did everything America wanted so now they're reaching deeper to find pretexts to essentially oppose every single thing China does. US whined about currency, China appreciates currency by 5-6% a year. US moves on to Iran, China gets on board about Iran. US complains about North Korea, China gets friendlier with South Korea and attempts to bring NK to the negotiating table. US whines about espionage, then Snowden blows the cover off that. So now America needs to crap out some nonsense about ""freedom of navigation"" as if China has ever considered restricting it in the SCS last 2,000 years or so. Even as far back as 1979 China got the States' (and Thailand's) blessing to smack Vietnam for trying to militarily dominate Indochina in Russia's name. 

Even if Xi capitulates, which he absolutely will not, the States will just invent some other pretext for its hostile, menacing behavior toward China. I'm guessing it'll be the ""Uyghur"" next. Once Chinese leaders realize this they will ""normalize"" i.e. start spending more than a piddly 1.8% or less of GDP (and 5% of the budget vs. 16% in India and the States) on defense.

The Soviet Union was a failed project. Instead of cooperation among the nations there was occupation under Kremlin rule. The economy was near collapse due to afghan war and the people were tired of Kremlin subjugation through repression like the Prague spring, Hungarian revolution and the massacre of protestors in Tbilisi. If the Kremlin tried to stay in power there would have been massive civilian casualties and chaos like when the Russian Empire fell. 

On your second point Ukrainian constitution does not allow a single oblast or province to vote to secede; it is by countrywide vote that determines secession of an oblast. Arbitrary I know but that is the law. If Texas did a referendum would the US allow that? If Kaliningrad asked for a referendum would Russia allow a strategically province seccede? I think not.  Same as why Ukraine would not give up the strategic Crimea. Self determination be damned when Geopolitics is at hand. Only through force and troops on the ground will states seccede without the permission of the head government. This happened with Kosovo and it happened with Crimea. 

Also most states do not allow secession with the odd exception of Scotland referendum. Russia had tried and failed at stopping the de facto secession of Chechnya and America fought it's own people of the south from secceding the Union. 

That is the status quo the maintenance of territorial integrity. With that there are stable economies and no wars fought for resources among the western nations. The world wars have convinced a civilized Europe that wars for resources are too costly in body count to fight. However Russia seems to not get the message and revels in militarism like its pretentious May 9 parade this year.

Trade is more important to the West and it has abandoned 19th century imperialism of occupation of land but Russia seems regressive with its revanchism and relapses into this 19th century imperialism and even revels in it with arrogant displays of the St Georges banner ever since 2014. Rampant nationalism and militarism like the May 9 parade is not good; it is a pretext to war. Russians now fear of war more than ever coming from NATO while general Americans are apathetic to the plight of Europe. European NATO countries do not even have standing armies and tanks capable of invading Russia but is now mobilizing and asking for America to send more troops. Russia should have worried more about its Custom Union rather than keeping an outdated and irrelevant fleet compared to the US's. Why show agression when NATO posed no threat to assault Russia as it is a defensive union. Has not Russia learned that it can't be a global navy power with navies blocked by straits in the west, ice to the north and not enough support infrastructure in Siberia to supply a fleet in the east?

&gt; If American trophy hunters were sincere, they could invest their wealth directly to fight illegal killing. Anti-poaching teams on the ground need help because poachers, often associated with terrorist groups, slaughtered an estimated 22,000 African elephants last year to sell trinkets in the global marketplace. That number is unsustainable, and wild elephants are plainly in crisis.

&gt; Alas, American trophy hunters are out to kill elephants for the same reason as poachers. They admit it. Here is what Safari Club International says in its official online record book:

&gt; ""An elephant with really good ivory (100 pounds, or 45 kg, per tusk used to be the magic number, though these days 70 pounds, or 32 kg, is considered very good) is generally considered Africa's top hunting trophy. Trophy quality is determined by the weight and beauty of the tusks.""

&gt; I ask myself: Would a poacher put it any differently?

&gt; Against tremendous pressure from a small cadre of hunters and others who want to trade in ivory, including the folks at Safari Club International, the United States has taken strong steps against the trade in ivory goods. In February, the Obama administration took aim at poachers by further tightening restrictions on this trade within America's borders. After China, America is the world's largest market for ivory products.

1172,"Eh if you're that bent in shape about the economist, a fairly mainstream rag, there's probably not much hope for you.  But whatever, I'm happy talking the academic work, I just included it for ease of readability.

Yes, yes of course definitions are important to consider.  There's a reason though why Chetty and most of the literature focus on rank jumping probabilities and intergenerational income elasticities.  They are the industry standard because they capture the amount of churn in society.  Consider the last one, the idea of measuring it based just off of income inequality.  We know, they mention it and it's all over the web if you care, that inequality is being driven by the top few percent.  Okay, so that means that if elasticities are reasonably high, it's all the more nicer to be born at the top than the middle or bottom.  But let's consider a simple thought experiment, suppose ten thousand upper middle income people all of a sudden started earning $5 Million.  This wouldn't mean any measure dependent on inequality measures would surely have mobility go down.  But would it change the likelihood of some kid born in rural Kentucky or Camden, NJ of escaping into the middle class?  Would it have any effect on the opportunities of a janitors children?  No...not really in any big effect.  It would effect the third measure due to its definition but have meaningful impact on the others.  

Now let's go on.  First off, what the fuck are you trying to say with this 

&gt; 'big blow to your rock solid objectivity' bullshit.  

If you actually recall, all I said in my first comment was 

&gt; Recent findings have suggested ...

That's fairly open ended and obviously true.  The Chetty paper was a big deal and has really redefined the lit.  Your trite snap of

&gt; What is this bullshit you're spewing? Social mobility in the US has been declining steadily for decades.

is certainly more absolutist and obviously we see it has a big gaping hole in it.  But let's continue.

&gt; Your third source strictly limits the data they take into consideration, which undoubtedly skews their results. For example, they excluded the extreme ends of income data, of participant age (eg. not including income from people over 48, which is years away from retirement age), and more. I just have to question how meaningful their conclusion is when they so severely limit the data they take into consideration. This is a good time to mention that both of your links did not observe data that far into the past; the first study only goes back to 1971, and the second only goes back to 1952. I would certainly like to see what affect the data from 1900-1940 would have on their conclusions for social mobility for the entire 20th century, but as it stands, this important information was not used. All in all, your case is much weaker and much more biased than you're making it out to be.

Okay, so first off, it's standard to not focus on extremes because 1) data often doesn't cover it as it can too easily reveal identities and 2) often behaves strangely as it's an outlier.  But really who cares when we're looking at measures like, 'what is the probability of being born into a family in the 2nd quintile and retiring into the 4th'?  It has ZERO effect on that kind of measurement, and that's a pretty standard way to look at mobility. 

Why don't they look at people over 48?  Well, that's probably because of how their data was presented, people over that are sometimes starting to work less, and that's generally around the height of your income earning potential.  

Finally, why don't they look at early 20th century?  ...because people have already fucking studied it.  Go do your own google scholar research and see if you have a useful point.  Take a look, for the most part I bet what you'll find is 1) the 60s-70s saw and uptick in mobility and 2) early 20th century mobility probably wasn't as high as we tend to think.  Unless you find evidence that pre 1950s America was a paragon of social mobility decreasing into the 50s, 60s, and 70s, you're going to have a hard time with this being relevant.  Remember this was a conversation about the recent and ongoing trend in social mobility. 

And again, I know my point was really complicated for you to understand, so I'll rewrite my comment that you so flippantly called bs, 

&gt; Recent findings have suggested it hasn't actually gotten worse in the US, just that Western Europe has seen a massive increase in social mobility over the last 30 years overtaking her.

So my case about the last 30 years (really should have said 50 - mea culpa) is much weaker because Chetty's seminal paper doesn't include data from a hundred years ago?  Take a deep breath and try to think, or just hold it, I don't really care.


&gt; If you can look outside of your echo chamber...

ouch, that really hurt. It's not like I've ever spent time going through this data or reading lots of econ papers.  Clearly my life has just been ever so sheltered.  Surely I should feel inspired by your command of the literature and debate so far.  But enough platitudes on your knowledge and logic, let us go on.  


Yeah... taking a cursory look at your first link, there is no mention of changing social mobility over time.  ...did you forget what we were talking about?


Your second link, first off it was originally written 23 years ago so maybe not the most relevant, but they at least have an updated graph at the top so whatever.  Let's see, the meat should probably all be in Krugman's 3rd point on Social Mobility so let's focus there, if I skipped something important above, feel free to let me know.  The second part on the Hubbard study just illustrates a bad point in some other people's work without addressing mobility itself.  But in his first part, actually looking at the data (by the way, I like how you criticized work that ignored the first half of the 20th Century and then cite work that really was only about the 80s, classic u/MetalOrganism), he does say:

&gt; ""The overall picture suggests little change in mobility."" 

which, loe and behold is almost exactly what my point was!  

So one has to ask, were you intentionally being obtuse, or did you just not feel like doing your homework, or were you simply doing me a favor by giving me something to talk about on reddit besides Sunday's Game of Thrones Episode?  

Your edit seems to just back up that you weren't really paying attention, that's kind of a shame.  The question at hand was whether or not social mobility had changed.  You seemed to get that in your first comment when you said:

&gt; Social mobility in the US has been declining steadily for decades.

but then you seem to keep losing track of that.  Maybe because you realized you were wrong but were too pigheaded to admit it and so tried to divert with red herrings, or maybe it all was just too much for you to keep track of.  Idk.  

So we good now?  Are you comfortable with my outlandish claims that 

&gt; Recent findings have suggested it hasn't actually gotten worse in the US, just that Western Europe has seen a massive increase in social mobility over the last 30 years overtaking her.

now? Do you see why it's probably a silly thing to say something like:  ""Social mobility in the US has been declining steadily for decades.""?  

Are you at least hopefully going to be a little less likely to accuse people of spewing bullshit about things which you don't appear to know that much about?

**From the article:** Blood moons, which is a gussied-up way of naming your garden-variety lunar eclipse, have preceded world-changing, shaking-type events, says Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia, a man constitutionally permitted to vote in one of the worlds most powerful legislative bodies. Legislation, accords, Security Council Resolutions, military aid packages  why consider this mere terrestrial ephemera when you can just go out into your backyard and consult the moon?

A blood moon tetrad coinciding with Jewish holidays in 1493 is said to have marked the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and the European discovery of America. Another in 1948-49 signaled Gods pleasure with the founding of the state of Israel; and the next, in 1967-68, coincided with the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, which allowed Israel to acquire Arab territory, much of which it still maintains. The occupied territory is considered prophetically necessary and in accord with Scripture by many conservative Christians.

There is, if you think about it, a bizarre strain of anti-patriotism at work in how these conservative Christians denounce America and extol Israel in the prophecy: Americas lost moral compass (gays can get married some places, I guess?) has angered God, while Israels aggressive stance in the region pleases Him. The (quite false) narrative of existential crisis for Israel compounds Gods anger at the U.S. for our wayward path, and the fourth blood moon is the tolling of a final bell. It is pro-Israel America-hating, in a way.

Here's some further facts to back up your claims.

* Australia did not become a federation until 1901, before that it was separate colonies. Considering that the transport of convicts stopped by 1868, that means Australia as a country has never technically been a penal colony.

* The Swan River colony which would become the state of Western Australia was a free settlement. Although it would later take on some convicts (under its own rule and not Britain's) it was by no means a traditional penal colony and instead a colony that used its own source of prison labour.

* The area around present day Victoria had two attempts at settlement by forces using convicts that failed and ultimately moved on to the state of Tasmania/Van Diemen's Land. John Batman (Melbourne/Batmania) and the Henry brothers eventually settled the area after some time they eventually took on 1,750 convicts from the Pentonville Probationary Prison who were allowed to work for pay and not the state.

* There were an estimated 162,000 convicts transported by the end of penal colonies in 1868. The population of Australia in 1868? 1,499,600.

* There was very few penal colonies in Australia as you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australian_penal_colonies)

In closing, while the first city settled in Australia was done with convicts that doesn't make the whole country a penal colony and when considering that over the lifetime of convicts being transported over only 10% of the population were convicts, it's safe to say that Australia was by and far settled by free settlers.",-1,0.120396825397,0.120771571277,0.496261022928,0.259627729947,0.466666666667,0.6875,298,0.0601092896175,22.9230769231,0.0583333333333,0.516666666667

1198,"a) American weapon transfers to rebels in Syria were extremely small, and, realistically, have contributed virtually nothing to ISIS. ISIS funds itself, captured (and outright purchased) plenty of weapons from the Iraqi army, and got weapon donations from large regional players. The region is currently flush with small arms.

This is a different situation; obviously, a lot of American weapon aid to the Iraqi army does wind up in ISIS's hands, including stuff that we really don't want there. But Iraq wanted the American army out, so there's not much America can do but bombing campaigns and risk-managed weapons transfers (for example, sending AT-4's instead of Javelins).

b) I think you misunderstand what fuels involvement in ISIS. Especially for local members, there are multiple reasons for joining with ISIS, from tribal conflicts, to sectarian conflicts, to religious motivations, to a sociopathic drive for meaning and glory. No matter how we look at it, however, bombing them, even with serious collateral, will not dramatically strengthen their recruitment drives because they *are not fighting America.* They are fighting a war of territorial expansion to establish a caliphate that controls the Levant - that's why they are called the Islamic State of *Iraq and the Levant* - or they are fighting to secure themselves from Shia oppression, or they are fighting to gain territory/hold territory against neighboring tribes, or they are fighting because they are psychos - I mean that literally, not just to denigrate them.

If there is US activity that breeds support for ISIS, it is, paradoxically, American support for the largely Shia Iraqi army, because they have committed some of the actual attacks on Sunnis that have made joining ISIS appealing.

Now, this article notes that the religious motivations of many ISIS members includes an opposition to modernity that is easily represented by America and other developed democratic societies, but bombing people does not make them religiously opposed to modernity; it may make them opposed to the American-led bombing campaign (including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc.), but, again, ISIS is not fighting America.

America, affraid of (fictional, purely for this perspective) nuclear weapons of Mexico says: Ok, we'll leave you alone, if you give us your nuclear weapons. Mexico proceeds with that and all is well. Than suddenly 15 years later there's an armed rebellion in Mexico and the new government joins Russia's new defence treaty and a 'South American Union', which means that the US will lose a lot of money.

Think about it this way. What if the US invaded, occupied, and annexed large swaths of South America and forcibly kept them under their thumb for decades. Then in the early 90's, the US government collapsed and all of those countries in South America decided that it was in their best interests to join a mutual defense alliance with another big country to prevent the US from invading and occupying them again.

""They're ambitious!"" ""They're stronger than Bin Laden!"" ""They're a critical problem!""

Your over simplified argument could be turned right back around on the united states for propaganda use in the opposite viewpoint. ""America is a huge threat. They have a huge population and a huge military, and endless financing. They have relations with other states, and are effective on the battlefield. They're invading Iraq on baseless accusations. They've killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, and are stealing our natural resources. They installing puppet dictators which cater to their economic and geo-political agendas.""

Its a legitimate statement, but provides no context and is oversimplified. And that's all we get from the mainstream media regarding the threat of ISIS. And yet, ISIS provides such utility for the United States. They were our gateway into Syria, they provided the UK and Canada the public fear they needed to pass far-reaching 'anti-terror' legislation, they allow our continued interventions in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. My basic question is, what does ISIS gain by making these threats against the west? They want to establish a caliphate state in the middle east, how does broadcasted beheadings of 2 Americans and the burning of a Jordanian, the claiming of attacks in the US (Texas art contest), and endless threats, even with nuclear weapons, against the west, help further that cause? These things only benefit the players who benefit from these endless wars in the middle east. I think our support of Saudi Arabia, our support of Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war, our 2003 invasion of Iraq, our overthrow of Gaddafi, all show without doubt that our intentions in the middle east are in no way to spread democracy and support peace.

And an additional point I want to make about the use of American propaganda. Think about the accusations we made against Saddam in terms of massacring his own people, suppressing uprisings, and his brutal dictatorship. Well... what are we doing right now? Saddam may have suppressed the Kurds and Shia's in northern Iraq, but now we (through the current Iraqi Ayatollah and other proxies) are massacring and suppressing the Sunni uprising which is ISIS, many of which are residents of Iraq (many are former dispersed Iraqi National Guard). So we run the same dictatorship that Saddam did, just in a different perspective. Not to mention, per Paul Bremer's orders of the new constitution of Iraq, the Ba'athist's are banned in the state, hows that for democracy? Conditions are no better in Iraq, and by most standards they're significantly worse. We've just reversed the roles. 

You might say, hey, ISIS is terrible, and does terrible things. That may be true, but what do you think the Sunni and Ba'athist setiment against the Shia's and Kurds were under Saddam?

America is far from perfect but living in America is pretty amazing. My cousin hasn't had a job in years (because he is both lazy and an idiot) and has a 2006 Honda car, a flat screen tv, cable, etc. He lives a pretty comfortable life and the work he does is odd jobs from time to time. Compare that to the executive of a major company. They make Millions and have a worth of up to Billions. Of course the inequality is enormous. But that doesn't mean that life at the bottom sucks. It financially ""sucks"" by comparison but it is still nice.

It is easy to pick and chose things you don't like about a country and I don't blame non-American redditors for thinking America must be a big ol' shit bag. America gets shit on a lot for having a shit government (which is true) and asshole corporations (also true).

People frequently ask 'Why don't you do something about your Government?! They are out of control'. The answer is pretty simple: 

The standard of living in America is very high. Most people have 'too much to lose'. A middle class person will read in the paper about a $5 billion bank corruption case and think 'Those fuckers! Someone should do something' and look out his window at his two children playing in the pool while his wife watches them and think 'I can't risk it.'

Finally, as something else to consider, the news and sites like reddit feed off of trends / headlines. You are going to get a disproportionally large sample of 'bad things' because 'good things' don't grab people's attention. I'm not saying America is perfect or that America is the best country in all metrics. I'm saying that if you do it right, living in America can be amazing.

And we're expected to believe that throughout **all** of these major scandals **no** high level executives were culpable and there wasn't enough information evidence to criminally prosecute even **one of them**.

No the answer is that there has definitely been enough evidence in all of these scandals to bring criminal prosecution against many people.

So you and your friend want to earn more money. So you decide to develop a new product. There's two groups

A. Group A wants to develop a cancer cure, a short course of this pill cures all cancers. 

B. Group B wants to improve a cancer drug which increases lifespan of the drug by 10 years.

Group A would naturally be the best for people.

The issue is if you do make drug A, you can't charge too much for a few pill which'll be used for a few weeks and after 50 years will go in open domain.

Drug B which is worse for patients, is an improvement on a previous drug which means a new patent, no hospital wants to sell a cheaper drug with smaller margins that's less effective, and so you can sell this pill for years and the customer might relapse and another course is required. You can improve this later and patent it again.

This statement is confused and ultimately incorrect.  Lacite is not the same as secularism, so you cant use a slash there. Lacite has the state try and remove religious expression from within state properties  and *those within them* (schools, government buildings), in a way secularism doesn't demand.

1294,"Thanks again for the answers. All i can say is wow, your conservative party does actually sound at least on par with our liberal party and way better than our conservative party. The thing i like least about America is its adherence to the idea that socialism somehow undermines liberty and freedom. The fact that your conservative party is good for the middle and upper class is something strange to me. The conservatives here serve the upper upper class and that class alone. Their policies are only in support for the uber rich and the middle class gets gutted because of it. The poor only support conservatism because they are uneducated and fall prey to the false advertising of the media and politicians and the bullshit ideologies of freedom the republicans continue to spout. American politics is a game of impressive manipulation and exploitation, even the democrats barely serve the people (since they have to make concessions to republicans to get anything done in Washington and even then the parties are not so different in ideology. At least the democrats believe that public services is an important thing to fund). America is a country controlled and strangled by the rich which makes me very angry and sad especially since so many people get distracted by smoke and mirror issues like gun control which have nothing to do with our huge income disparity and poverty in which so many Americans suffer. This is why i am thinking about moving to Germany or England if the opportunity presents itself in my life. 

my only other question is do you think moving to England in a few years would be a good idea, why or why not?",1,0.0695945945946,0.162995880601,0.510585585586,0.264160687212,0.5,0.807142857143,284,0.0787878787879,23.6666666667,0.0892857142857,0.807142857143

1297,"You're right, I didn't. I felt it would have been long winded but here it is imo: the world as it's power structures are organized now (UN, NATO etc.) are extremely unipolar, and America is that pole. After WW2 America basically forged a New World Order (no not the lizard people one ;)) in which the idea of sovereign right (meaning war for territory is a huge no-no) were held above all else, this was a reaction to the Soviet annexation of Eastern Europe. This world order was only half of the puzzle until the Soviet collapse however, and right as they fell Saddam tried to invade and annex Kuwait. What Saddam was doing more than just ""getting his"" was provoking the US and their World Model, because he was demonstrating that even without the Soviets that the US would not respond to an attack on a sovereign nation for their territory. The US did not want there to be another alternative World Model in which rogue nations could ignore UN resolutions or pressure from the West, so they invaded but didn't take him out, respecting his sovereign rights but trying to force him to conform to their World Model.

After 9/11, the game changed and shortly after Saddam kicked out UN weapons inspectors, proving once again he was a geopolitical black hole and did not answer to the global community, effectively spitting in the face of the power structures the US has been trying to put in place since WW2 and especially post-Soviets. We laugh at it now, but Saddam having WMDs and being internationally unaccountable, and looking to nurture an ""axis"" World Model where rogue nations can do as they please with their neighbors (and potentially fund terrorism which would erode our power by proxy attrition) was a very real existential threat to the world order built by NATO and the US. He had the ingredients to do it, and there is a chance he sent his weapons to Bashar al-Assad because he is a Russian vassal and the Russians still have an interest in an opposing World Model. They would have a lot to gain from making America's excursions in the name of their world order look foolish. Who knows if it happened like that but we do know from Russia's annexation of Crimea that they are politically in favor of a different world order, where there are no sovereign rights.

On ISIS and Assad, I believe Obama is playing a dangerous game trying to wield chaos to achieve geopolitical goals. ISIS is not a sustainable organization, their wrath breeds contempt in  the people around and under them. They will crumble. Assad is far more stable in peace time, and if his regime survives he will continue to generate legitimacy for the Russian World Model, which undercuts American power, so in American interest the Obama administration is trying to turn ISIS back into Syria to take down Assad, because ISIS is making us friends out of foes (Iran is closer now imo than anytime since 1979) and Assad makes foes out of friends due to Syrian regional political and economic power, and also gives the Russians power in the Middle East. We can't take out Assad directly either unless he scorns the international community like Saddam because that looks bad when we try to make sovereign rights a staple of our world order. 

tl;dr In the middle east, Saddam and Assad (and Iran as well) give power to an alternate world order which is crafted by Russia and is effectively the shadow of Soviet world order.

How about the twitter page officially run by the ISIS ""government."" Or the official videos made by ISIS. Or the widespread genocide (especially of the Yazidi peoples) and rapings that we *know* are happening. And the fact that the government does exactly fuck all to stem or even protest any of this.

And bloody hell, ISIS has not been shy in stating that its official policy is to not just to kill non-Muslims, but also muslims from different sects than them. Or banning basic educational foundations like mathematics, science, and history from anything outside of the Qu'ran.

&gt; you can take accounts of well documented abuse by us soldiers as a relative handful of tragedies? 

Yes, because there are. In any given conflict there are a relative handful of these cases. That is to say, that there *are* cases where US soldiers rape civilians, ormurder civilians under unjustifiable conditions. But these are relatively isolated cases, and not something that happens whenever the US enters a new city in a country.

And even then, these cases are not only rare, but very small in scope. It's not American troops killing dozens and hundreds of innocent Yazidis for no reason. It's one shitty guy raping a girl, or one or two shitty guys killing a couple of people. It's not an American platoon slaughtering entire masses of innocent people for no justifiable reason. And unlike in the IS, most cases where this has happened, especially in the last 100 years or so, end with trials and massive flak and punishment for the perpetrators, whereas in the IS the ""government"" either encourages or says absolutely nothing about it.

Show me the IS prosecuting someone for killing a Yazidi or what they consider a heretic/infidel, and I'll drop my argument. I'll be waiting.

&gt;but one or four occurrences by ISIS is enough for you to approve a large regional war sure to kill millions?

One or four? What the bloody hell are you talking about? There have been dozens of cases of ISIS killing and beheading journalists. And dozens of cases of mass beheadings. And numerous cases of mass murders of Yazidis. And numerous cases of women being captured and sold as sex slaves. And this is over a period of time of less than a year.

&gt;oh and murder is murder, the method is trivial

Sorry, but no. The world isn't so black and white that all bad things are equally bad. Bad isn't a monolith, not all bad things are the same kind of bad, and there is a sliding scale. In other words, we live in a world made up of different shades of grey.

For example, murdering someone because you were defending yourself is not equivalent to murdering someone out of cold blood. Furthermore, murdering someone by accident is not the same as premeditated murder - which is why pretty much any halfway decent legal system on the planet takes these things into consideration. Because not all similar bad actions are similarly bad.

Killing someone as an unintended consequence of attacking a military target is *not* the same as killing someone just to kill them. It's terrible and a tragedy, yes, but it is not comparable in the slightest.

&gt;america does the same barbaric things they do, proven in every war america has

Men have it very bad (at least in the United States) when it comes to societal norms / dating / marriage / and divorce. This is why they are running away from marriage in record numbers. 

Gay people are also very supportive of their own. There is an unspoken rule in corporate America where gay coworkers look out for each other. Not only that, but we move up to management positions very quickly because of our work ethic, lack of children, and our ability to shift between ""male"" and ""female"" view points.

Straight people will deny it and argue this by citing various studies , but trust me on this....gay people (and lesbians) have a very unique ability to see things from multiple perspectives. Men think like men. Women think like women....gay people can think like BOTH. This is a huge advantage in so many ways for obvious reasons.

There are a lot of negative statistics regarding gay people, like a high amount of homeless, depression, suicide, etc....but that is because many of us crack under the pressure of society. If you can develop the confidence to ignore ""haters"", you're likely to join the ranks of widely successful gay people. On average, we earn more than straight couples. Some argue it's because there's two men in the relationship as opposed to one man and one woman. Regardless, who cares....you're earning more than straight couples. We're also over represented in Ivy League schools AND Fortune 500 companies.

Unlike straight men, you'll never go through life devoid of sex either. 

As a young gay, you're not likely to get distracted by relationships and ""love"". You'll dedicate your time to school, college, and making something of yourself. Straight people make many mistakes in their younger years, often the result of jealous love, which can be hard to bounce back from depending on how bad they fucked up.

The big oil fields in Saudi are under Shiia tribal land *""Find Shiia Find oil""* is a regional saying.

[Shiia area of Saudi](http://nealrauhauser.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/saudi-peninsula-shia-areas.png?w=625&amp;h=482)

Should a Shiia crescent form made up of, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Shiia Saudi, it would be a massive blow to US hegemonic power in the world and put something like 40% of the worlds oil under shiia hands.
It would mean the fall of the house of Saud. He who controls the valve of oil controls the windpipe of Europe and Asia. It would change the world.  

It's been speculated that the Sauds could lose this immense source of strategic power and wealth to the Shiia  with Iran supplying a few sound systems mounted on the backs of truck and 20 Shiia Imans. This is why the Sauds are give a free hand to do what they want to crush Shiia dissent in Barhain, which is the opposite of Syria, A Sunni majority led by Shiia, but a Shiia majority led by a Sunni, ( put in place by the Sauds. )

It would also led to the loss of the petrodollar. The use of the petro$ means that the US can print dollars to pay for price increases in oil. Industrialized countries without oil, such as Japan EU or China, have to export to the US in order to obtain dollars to exchange for Opec oil; for example, cars in the case of Japan. So America gets oil and services and goods (eg cars) in exchange for pieces of paper. Not only that but Opec's excess dollars were then reinvested in the US and other industrialized countries, thus funding the US budget deficit and reducing US interest rates.

It would be a massive blow to lose the petrodollar. If no one bought US$ anymore I wonder how far it would drop in value. This possible outcome is best headed off early. Support of the Sunni rebels in Syria does this. 


This is also why rebellion in Bahrain, a Shiia state ruled by a Sunni is discouraged and Saudi given a free hand to crush the rebellion and Syria, a Sunni state ruled by a Shiia in encouraged.


**TL;DR** The Sunni Muslims (Saudi, Kuwait  Egypt) are regional allies, the Shiia Muslims (Iran Syria Iraq) enemies. So the US supports the Sunni Shiia administration.

The last American president who attempted to expose this was JFK. He was assassinated. He intended to stop using a central bank and allow the country to print its own money once more, debt free. He also intended to stop the war machine.


The concept of a powerful countries leader being assassinated to create a new hierarchy and power structure is known as a coup detat. A coup d'tat also known as a coup, a putsch, or an overthrow, is the sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military. A coup d'tat is considered successful when the usurpers establish their dominance. When the coup neither fails completely nor succeeds, a civil war is a likely consequence. A coup d'tat typically uses the extant government's power to assume political control of the country. In Coup d'tat: A Practical Handbook[page needed], military historian Edward Luttwak states that ""[a] coup consists of the infiltration of a small, but critical, segment of the state apparatus, which is then used to displace the government from its control of the remainder."" The armed forces, whether military or paramilitary, can be a defining factor of a coup d'tat.

Your memory conveniently forgets that after Israel withdrew, Hamas took power and started terrorist attacks again. So that created the ""illusion"" 

&gt;It is all bullshit, they can either have a 2 state solution where they are not caged and can control their own borders and air and water, with a complete withdrawal from West Bank as well.

Well last time I checked, Israel did agree to this, multiple times. Which side denied the 1948 UN resolution and declared war? Going by your angry comments you seem to think Israel started the war.


&gt;Or they can do a 1 state solution where they give Palestinians the same rights are Israelis, but neither one will ever be accepted by Israel because it kills their Zionist dream of having the whole land for themselves with a Jewish majority.

Wow, so you're telling me Palestinians are okay with Israel existing, and becoming Israelis? All that is stopping them is the evil Zionists? What a strange and heavily biased claim

&gt;What they are doing now is slowly stealing more land and killing the people off or waiting till they have enough and those who can leave, do leave. This is unacceptable and is in violation of international law. Occupation is illegal and so are the settlements.

Another strange comment, so why did Israel give back the Sinai and other land in the 67 peace, and also offered Gaza and the West Bank back to Egypt and Jordan?

If their main goal was to expand their borders and take control illegally of everything, that doesn't make sense. They wanted a land for peace deal, but Jordan and Egypt didn't care about taking the land back and giving Palestinians their country.

But once again, you love playing the Jew is the scapegoat game, best seen in 1930's Germany

1372,"If you are suggesting that ISIS is the result of American policy and not Iran's successful push for influence in Iraq, then I think you are wrong.

ISIS successfully gains territory when it fights against the Iraqi army. The Obama administration pushed al-Maliki to leave 10,000 American infantry in Iraq in a revised Status of Forces, but al-Maliki chose to align himself with Iran and used weak excuses to refuse those troops in 2012. ISIS currently has approximately 20,000-51,000 active ground troops in both Syria and Iraq together - many of whom are tied to specific locations or part-time, and 10,000 American ground troops, paired with a sub-par Iraqi army would have held off ISIS and made successful offensives to take back ISIS-acquired territory in Iraq. Additionally, it would have been feasible to reinforce those troops if necessary, and they would have dramatically increased the effectiveness of the current bombing campaign. Finally, many of the capable army units that would normally join the Iraqi army are receiving Iranian funding to join Shia militia, making the Iraqi army further bereft of good soldiers. Iraqi oil profits and Iraqi army equipment have greatly benefited the group in Syria and Iraq.

**tl;dr:** Iranian influence led directly to the massive troop failures systemic to the Iraqi army that allowed ISIS to take and hold Iraqi territory.

Beyond Iranian weapons being responsible for a record number of US infantry deaths in Iraq as Iran tried to push its influence around 2011 through Shia militias - like Kataib Hezbollah, the Promise Day Brigade, and Asaib al Haq - these militias provided the reason many Iraqi Sunnis see ISIS as a necessity for their own protection, and have led directly to the rise in sectarian conflicts and the long-term failure of the American troop surge that began in 2007. Let's not go down the rabbit hole of mentioning the crimes against humanity Shia militia are involved in, other than to say that many Sunnis in ISIS are acting rationally when they align themselves with ISIS against the Iran-supported Iraqi government and Iran-sponsored Shia militia.

**tl;dr** Iran-sponsored Shia militias fed directly into ISIS recruitment and increased sectarian conflict in Iraq.

American ground troops were unwanted when they were given, and when it became clear that Iran's policies were an overplayed hand, America got the blame. Iranian power politics caused this.

I think of buying drugs in the same capacity, the only caveat is making sure that they are actually pure and that I am not buying anything other than what I am paying for. And a big part of the questionable nature of drugs comes from them being illegal, the laws seem to actually make us less safe.

Nuke your way out? America spends 10 cents per head per year on civil defense. The Russians and Chinese spend 20 USA dollars per head per year. They can shelter their entire populations. Not to mention china and Russia are much larger and much hillier and so nukes won't do was much damage. Also Russia's has more nukes than all NATO combined. In such a nuclear exchange The Chinese and Russian mirvs will pour over the North Pole like a storm and glass every square inch of American soil and kill every living American until even the memory of your nation has been destroyed. Meanwhile the Chinese and Russians survive as a people and as nations.

So even just china versus America China would win if America was invading china or on its borders. 

But in any such war Russia would stand by china. 

This is why there will never be a war between American and China. There was only ever one war between the two and China tore America a new arsehole in that one and ever since then America has been terrified to face down china.

1428,"a brief overview of the M.E

there are two major factions in the M.E. Sunni and Shiia. the US backs the Sunni.
Those Sunni countries being Saudi, Egypt, Kuwait. 
the Shiia being Iran, Iraq, Syria.

It's all about the ability to control access to the worlds most plentiful source of energy. 50% of the worlds oil is sourced from the M.E.  

[Here's a real US policy doc from 1955. Take note of the objectives. Its not mythical. Its there in black and white.  ](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB78/propaganda%20127.pdf)

Americas number one objective in the Middle East: **The availability to the US and its allies of resources, the strategic positions and the passage rights and the denial of such rights and resources to the soviet block.**

So in 1955 the US sought to control the Gulf, to have the ability guarantee its access and to deny access to others.  Oil has not become less important in the prevailing 60 years. 

Formally the USSR was the rival and was seen off with the help of Israel, ( It was what proved Israels worth to the US ) Iran was a client. Iran is no longer a client and so currently the US would like to prevent the formation of  the a [**Shiia crescent,**](http://bintel.com.ua/uploads/images/2014/vol3.jpg) with Iran at its head. 

This crescent would include the Shiia land in Saudi. This is why Saudi and Iran are implacable enemies. Saudi is a US client for protection against Iran. [**If you look and Shiia land in Saudi**](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w26Pl18fmRY/TzFc-rnckII/AAAAAAAAAMg/z8K_-AuXefQ/s1600/Saudi_shia.jpg) you'll note it sits on top of the [**big oil fields**](http://www.reallycoolblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Oil-Gas-Fields-Map.gif). ""Find Shiia find oil"" is a local saying. The Shiia are the potential rivals to US hegemony in the gulf.  

Should Iran succeed in creating such an entity this would be a genuine threat to Americas passage rights and strategic positions in the  region, which as you will recall is America #1 objective in the M.E.

The US will seek to control the M.E. so long as oil powers the world. Control of this resource is a major plank in the USA's super power status.    
I don't think there is a better ally in this ambition to control the gulf than Israel. Israel is a western enclave in the region, is a regional pariah completely dependent on the US for weapons and coverage from UN sanctions and proven ability to kick arab ass. Who would be better?

If you view everything in the M.E. through a Sunni/Shiia/Oil lens all becomes clearer.

The US state dept has called Saudi and the description can be extended to the region [**a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history.**](http://revcom.us/a/090/iran-pt2-en.html)  

[Zbigniew Brzezinski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski) former United States National Security Advisor said America's control over the Middle East [**""gives America indirect but politically critical leverage on the European and Asian economies that are also dependent on energy exports from the region.""**](http://www.idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/GlobalOilPoliticsandtheEnergySecurityintheAsianregion_JNandakumar_110405) . [George Kennan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan) put is as ""Veto power"". Truman's Secretary of Defense James Forrestal noted that [**whoever sits on the valve of Middle East oil may control the destiny of Europe**](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a916768279&amp;fulltext=713240928) and now Asia. 

Control the M.E and you have your foot on the windpipe of the European and Asian economies. relinquishing that control is  unthinkable. (Having permanent military bases in Iraq makes very good sense in this context ) relinquishing control to an Iranian shiia block /China/ Russia is doubly unthinkable. All other potential rivals have to figure Americas control of the oil flow into their calculations. The USA controls the oil. If the USA decides, say China, will not be getting M.E. oil then it can stop the flow. China knows this, the USA knows this. Thus before things get violent China will have to back down. ( China used for example only ) 

BTW China is taking steps strengthen the sea route from the Gulf to China, [**the string of pearls naval ports**](
http://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/string-of-pearls1.jpg)

On the Petro$: The Shiia would not use the petro$. The use of the petro$ means that the US can print dollars to pay for price increases in oil. Industrialized countries without oil, such as Japan EU or China, have to export to the US in order to obtain dollars to exchange for Opec oil; for example, cars in the case of Japan. So America gets oil and services and goods (eg cars) in exchange for pieces of paper. Not only that but Opec's excess dollars were then reinvested in the US and other industrialized countries, thus funding the US budget deficit and reducing US interest rates.

It would be a massive blow to lose the petrodollar. The value of the $ would plunge, the PetroEuro would rise. The Europeans would plunder US assets.


TL:DR if you look at any conflict in the M.E. look at the sides, Shiia and Sunni, I'll find the US will back the Sunni as they have oil and use the Petro$

Tell me, since when did the US give a flying fuck about the morality of it's allies, cough Saudi Arabia cough.

No, it's defending Israel. As it implies the only reason people criticise Israel is because it's Jewish.

&gt; Did America stop being a liberal democracy when George W. Bush was in power?

Uh, the United States of America was never a democracy, let alone a liberal one. The USA is a republic in case you didn't know.

&gt; Just because people that you don't like get elected doesn't make Israel not a liberal democracy.

You have such juvenile perceptions of politics...

&gt; Hamas is genocidal. And they are flagrantly jihadist.

And he proves this by posting a link to Palestinian Media Watch, a propaganda outfit created by radical Jewish settlers that has been thoroughly discredited by scholars many times over.

&gt; Wow. Way to take victim blaming to a whole new level. Read and watch the links I posted

*Rolls eyes*

&gt;  and tell me that the problem is that Israel asks to be recognized as Jewish.

I don't need to tell you that. It's a fact. They wouldn't put it in the agreement otherwise if they didn't think it would halt the peace effort.

&gt; For a guy who ""doesn't take sides"" you sure seem pretty intent on defending Hamas.

I don't need to take anybody's side to recognise what you're saying as lies.

&gt; The only difference between Hamas and Al Qaeda is that Hamas principally kills Israelis (and their fellow Palestinians). I guess that's enough to make you like them.

You disgust me. Honestly and truly, on a fundamental level you disgust me.

&gt; That's a terrible definition.

And yet, it is the official Oxford English Dictionary definition. Unless you consider yourself a higher authority, I'd suggest you respect the definition.

&gt;Unchecked capitalism leads to inequality and wealth accumulation.

And here we are with an unfathomable degree of inequality. 

&gt;Democracy has nothing to do with it, if it has, then only as a positive impact (people can actually change law). 

People can't change shit. We live under the illusion that we have a voice or could make a difference. The only thing that makes a difference is wealth, and the influence that comes with it. The wants of the rich supersede the needs of the poor.

&gt;You really need to study more history, since all those mentioned alternatives to democracy lead to nearly constant wars and infighting.

That's funny because if you'd studied your history you'd know that America is one of the most war hungry nations in the history of the world and spends more money on their military than upwards of the next five or more nations combined. Also, the civil war would constitute infighting. So essentially america was built on war and infighting. They haven't stopped warring since.

So there goes that theory.

&gt;Another thing, just because the voting system is outdated, doesn't mean the whole idea of democracy is. We could easily strengthen a Democratic society by using easier voting methods, and more direct ones at that (no middlemen like the us has).

Coulda woulda shoulda. Isn't going to happen.

Abolish democracy and capitalism.

&gt;&gt; This is nonsensical. What about my point are you trying to refute?

&gt;It's nonsensical if you can't read, Mr trying to play irony off but failing miserably.  You say racial politics benefits white people the most.

No.

I don't want to turn this into a pointing match, but you are being incredibly hypocritical if you think I'm oversimplifying any more than you are.

Im saying, the vast majority of the powerful financial, academic, government, etc, institutions in the west were created by white people and continue to favor white people in terms of the transfer of power (Wealth, political, societal views) instead of everyone equally. In the past and to some extent still, society has allowed these institutions to mistreat and disenfranchise minority groups.

&gt;I say that's a complete bullshit oversimplification. Our society is setup to benefit those that are willing to work for it. It's not? Explain ANY BLACK PERSON THAT WAS DISADVANTAGED AND OVERCAME.  That's the problem with gross over-simplifications. They are too steadfast. That's the problem with Al Sharpton and the rest of you morons who fail to see that this ongoing inability to give black people credit for what they are perfectly capable of is, indeed, racist.

This isnt about black people, stop trolling. Though in the US people from Southwest Asia are considered white for many things, their day to day life in Europe and North America is one of much more mistreatment than I've faced when traveling. Anecdotes aren't much of a source, but I hold my values because I've seen many great people be discriminated against in hiring practices and in day to day life.

&gt;Life is setup to benefit those that are born into wealth. Life isn't fair. Life can suck. But it's not something that is mutually exclusive to blacks. To say so is tantamount to lunacy. Life isn't unfair to black people in the West any more than it is unfair to Mississippi Delta white trash. Poverty. 

Stop. I'm not talking about probability.

&gt;&gt; Of course it is. That has nothing to do with my post though.

&gt;Of course it does. You said the system benefits white people the most. Now you're saying it benefits those that work hard (life is what you make of it). Make up your mind. 

Life is what you make of it does not mean what you think it does. 

But clearly your perception of things is infallible. At least I'm trying to get something out of what you're saying (if you're not trolling. I really think you are at this point), but you're just saying stuff about black people not living up to some standard you've set and you believe society has done the same. I'm saying in the west (the majority of the people being white, wielding the majority of the power, and having a history of discrimination against minorities, though our society claims to want equality for all) systemic racism affects everyone other than white people because white people make up the vast majority of the system. Everyone can be affected by racism. But in the west, white people have not and most likely will not be discriminated against in the same way minority races in the west have been. This you'll have to prove on your own.

&gt;&gt; Please attempt to comprehend what is actually being discussed.

&gt;It's like you don't know how fucking quotes work. I LITERALLY posted what you said and directly responded. If you can't follow the breadcrumbs to the obvious point I was making...Jesus. 

I actually laughed out loud. Don't bother responding if you haven't understood what you're replying to or ask for clarification.

&gt;&gt;  but the dynamics of power in a society where one group is heavily represented and treat those who they view as different as second class citizens. 

&gt;Shut the fuck up.  Who is treating black people like 2nd class citizens?

Oversimplification: To simplify to the point of causing misrepresentation, misconception, or error.

I'm not talking about only black people. I believe many minorities are harassed, mistreated, and are overly punished by the institutions in the west. Again, you can go find sources of common knowledge, but here are some hints: 
Latinos being required to carry papers proving citizenship in the SW US
The aggressive gerrymandering of voting bases, the elimination of early voting, and requiring multiple forms of ID as attempts to disenfranchise minority voters in the urban east US

&gt;ALL WHITE PEOPLE! WHITE PEOPLE ARE EVIL! We have a black fucking president, tool. He wouldn't have been elected had there not been an overwhelming national support for a black man. How can you have it both ways? We're SOOOO racist that we elect a black man to lead the free world? How are we racist? I just want definitive PROOF (link - not your bullshit, edgy platitudes) that any institutional problems facing ALL BLACK PEOPLE are the result of institutional racism. It should be easy for you to provide such proof. Go. 

I know the internet is a place of no shame, but you make me cringe.

&gt;&gt; You acting as if black people are the only group that has been (or as you're saying, is capable of being) systemically oppressed in western society is the only racism here.

&gt;WTF are you talking about? If anything, I'm making the opposite point. I'm saying that everyone has obstacles. Fortunately for black people, they get things like affirmative action

Go learn about affirmative action. And if your mind hasn't melted by then, list all of the minorities (if they're not over all, they are in the applicant pool) groups that receive it, in which instances (however many you can find), and why you think they receive, as well as why anyone in a position of power would adopt it? I feel like I'm trying to teach someone how to think critically. I don't actually think you should waste your time learning something, you should just demand people on reddit to spoon feed stuff to you s/.

&gt;You are saying that blacks experience such woefully oppressive institutional racism. So link me. Show me. And remember, correlation =/= causation.

Nope, you're oversimplifying what I'm saying in order for you to say that. I'm saying everyone but white people experiences systemic racism in the western world in which they're most advantaged.

&gt;&gt; And I wasnt suggesting that it did.

&gt;Then maybe you should choose your words more carefully.

Please learn how to think. Or maybe reading is the problem? It could be seeing for all I know.

&gt;""Of course there can be individual cases of racism or hate crimes committed against a white person, but that doesn't mean white people at large are affected by racism in the same way other people are."" I asked you to prove it.

You asked me to prove something when I wasn't trying to prove anything. I stated my belief and you're here telling me to prove my belief to you. You can hold yours all you want for all I care and for what it's worth, Ill always think you're stupid.

&gt;You can't. You won't. You only have correlative arguments and edgy 1-liners.

I didn't type that and that's not the case in the real world. 

I believe I was more than clear, but here's my last shot at getting it through your enfeebled mind: White people (Not Asian, or any other group of people who you deem to be ), in the western world, have not and do not suffer from systemic racism.

Central America is largely underdeveloped, so there's not much foreign pressure for US intervention, compounded with the hostility many Latin American nations hold from previous US interventions. The truth is the US *does* participate in Mexico, largely as an extension of the war on drugs and humanitarian policy, but it treads carefully so it's not seen as intruding on issues of Mexican sovereignty. Beyond that the process of pursuing action is long and complicated, and there are many opposing forces within the US government that make it so only issues seen as salient (which are few) get addressed, and often moral issues simply don't make the cut.

I should not have to explain to you the threat terrorism has proven to be for the US no? Then why should I have to explain to you why America attacked and destroyed the leadership of these terrorist funding/harboring countries and the systems that promote it? Right? I mean it seems like a pretty easy 1-2-3 concept that's not hard to understand.

Terrorist promise to destroy us all. They have proven capable of at least causing us problems. These countries all supported one or more of these groups directly. 

Lets change the scenario so maybe you will understand. America is at war with say Scotland. Although Ireland hasn't attacked us directly we know for a fact they are helping supply, fund, and hide Scottish military units. Guess what Ireland just added itself to the war. 

You are making it seem like while we just happen to be over there fighting terrorism we just attacked these countries for the lolz. No, they all added themselves in the conflict, most probably thinking they had hidden it away enough that America wouldn't know, but we always know.

Does it make sense now?

I also like the ""they were willing to give up Bin Laden if the US could provide proof of his involvement, which we still don't have"" Lol first off we do now and did then. Secondly do you think we were asking them politely to give us bin laden? It wasn't a request, ""if you can prove"" my ass. We were coming for him period.

Actually the threat of terrorism is way overblown, and since 911 the US and European have helped increase it (eg: ISIS).

&gt;  Then why should I have to explain to you why America attacked and destroyed the leadership of these terrorist funding/harboring countries and the systems that promote it? 

Again, Iraq and Libya had nothing to do with these, only now they are after being destroyed by us. If we were serious about terrorism we would stop supporting it, and we could start with the main sponsor of terrorism: Saudi Arabia, until then it's all theatre.

&gt; Terrorist promise to destroy us all. They have proven capable of at least causing us problems. These countries all supported one or more of these groups directly.

What countries are you referring to, because neither Iraq nor Libya were, and the latter got the worse of it, since it was the most advanced country in Africa before being destroyed.

&gt;  No, they all added themselves in the conflict, most probably thinking they had hidden it away enough that America wouldn't know, but we always know.

Sorry, but apart from Afghanistan (and even then this is not clear) none of the countries we attacked (Iraq, Libya, Syria) supported terrorism against Westerners.

Like I said, if we were serious about terrorism, we would go after the main players, unfortunately the military industrial complex is economically tied to these conflicts.

1553,"Okay, let me point out some issues here.

Yes the Comcast merger was denied.  Yes the FCC pushed ahead with Net Neutrality.  Lobbying lost right?  No.  In both cases, the defeats happened because bigger money came in from the tech industy came in to push it down.  Net Neutrality looked dead until the Chamber of Commerce came down in favour of it.  The Comcast merger died when Netflix and Google came in and crushed.  In fact, politicians called it the 'tech gold rush' because those companies previously hadn't been strong lobbyists and the politicians finally found a way to cash in on them.

You say America has one of the highest effective corporate tax rates on Earth, which is a misuse of 'effective'.  The 'real' tax rate is quite high.  The 'effective' tax rate is insanely low with write offs and loopholes.  In fact, General Electric actually receives money back from the government, paying 0 in taxes because their effective tax rate is in the negative numbers.  

You point out that government protected monopolies aren't common, but you ignore that government subsidies to big business are actually quite common.  The oil industry, despite being hugely profitably, receives government funds.  As does the agricultural industry.  Effectively limiting the ability of alternate energy sources (solar, electric) to compete, because tehy don't receive subsidies.

Nike's lobbying?  Nike's not known as a strong lobbyist by any manner or means.

Microsoft being protected from Google?  Microsoft's profits are driven by Windows, an operating system.  Google's profits are centered on their search engine.  They actually don't compete much, there's very little overlap between them.

You say it hasn't protected Walmart from Amazon, but again, they have entirely different business models.  Amazon is an online retailer.  Walmart is a brick and mortar retailer.  Most of Walmart's lobbying is centered around a low minimum wage.  Which they have been very successful with.

At lastly, you seem to be dismissive of behaviours like trade deals, industry regulation and intellectual property laws.  These are all HUGE issues.  Millions of American workers stand to lose their jobs because of the heavily lobby TAPP trade deal.   Intellectual property and patent laws have been relaxed to the point where pharmaceutic companies are looking at 25 year+ patents, that means that you will not be able to get competitor drugs for many common illness for a quarter of a century, effectively giving them monopoly power for years on end.

So basically, I think you're off base on most of if not all of your points, due to have a poor understanding of the facts.

Your question is ""do you really buy into the USA #1! Army Stronk! stuff""?

It is quite hard to put into words that you could believe or understand. I mean this is one little tid bit. America has 13K combat aircraft in operation around the world 24/7. The next largest Russia at 3k. That's a 10k difference from second place. Subs we have 78 top of the line best in the world, second again Russia with 62 (90% are cold war era). Carriers, the US has 20, there really is not second place thats more then the rest of the world combined and some. Man power we have 120 million serviceable with 2 million ready for combat. That increases by 4 million yearly, next china with 1.8 million ready for combat (however most will not even have a rifle to fire much less the bullets it requires). Budget America has a $577 billion dollar budget ( more then almost every other countries entire income) which is more then China and Russia spend on its military and space program....combined. We are not even talking the black budget (R&amp;D) which is confidential but estimated at close to or slightly over $1 trillion...) and the biggest kicker? America has an literally off the chart (almost uncharitable) purchasing power parity of over $16 trillion dollars, that's $16,720,000,000,000.

Your question is did I buy into this? Abso-fucking-lutley. You would be a fool to not. This numbers have indicated since the late 80's that it would take the entire world, all its countries, civilizations, and militaries to conquer America and even then its 50/50. 

This is not my pride for ""Murica"" this is reality. 

If you are an American feel the most blessed out of any citizen on earth and you should. If you are not for your own sakes I wouldn't promote ""hate America"" day in your local town, just might regret that in the worst way.

&gt;We have endlessly described the tightening bow in the N American continent and the center of this bow near San Diego. Of course the bursting water mains there are related. We have likewise described the stretch zone accidents in the wide arc of the East Coast of the N American continent, and Philadelphia is centered there. We have explained that river bottoms are where the crust is weak and thus more readily pulled apart during stretch zone accidents. The recent Amtrak derailment  was a classic case of what a speeding train will do when the tracks are not where expected.

&gt;Lowlands, such as the Philadelphia Amtrak curve, are also where electro-magnetic pulse is most likely to occur, as the recent blackouts in Washington DC show. The thin crust is pulled apart more than neighboring rock strata, and thus the electro-magnetic screech is intensified. Lowlands are also soggy, full of water which is a superb conduit for electricity. We predicted that the East Coast would be subject to more electro-magnetic pulse, and this has occurred. Pulse causes brownouts but also surge, as occurred in the Amtrak train and in the transformer explosion at the Indian Point power plant near New York City.

&gt;**As N America tightens, it affects the North Atlantic Rift, which is pulling apart as anyone observing the volcanic activity in Iceland can determine. Thus support for the continental shelf off-shore from Norway and Europe is weakened, and droops. That these stretch zone accidents are occurring almost simultaneously shows the inter-relationship of these plate movements. To those who have been following ZetaTalk these stretch zone accidents are not a surprise, nor will they be surprised at what is to follow shortly. The New Madrid zone in N America is awakening.**

States will still try to defy, and they're just going to make themselves look foolish and ass backwards, and hurt themselves.

The supreme court decided that interracial marriage was a right in '67, Alabama(The backwards ass crack of America), didn't allow it until 2000. 

However, I think we've come a far ways as a nation.. And after the supreme court rules on gay marriage, the transition will be fast.. There's just far too many Americans who believe in the whole equality thing.

1631,"I can tell you what the logic is:

From the authorities point of view, these kids aren't really ""German"" even if they have documents that make them legally native born nothing else but German, because they couldn't have ancestors in Germany who were living during the time of the Holocaust.

In the sense of ""well, 'they' as in their family connections weren't German then, so why lecture them""

Add on to that the fact that there's a clear tension between the desire of Germany to fiercely maintain its modern sense of regret and deliberate humanity (every younger than Reuinifcation aged German has had the Holocaust and all the history lessons about it in *exhaustive* detail in the public school system) *and* the obvious conflicts post-9/11 between the Western world and predominately Muslim ones (from which these students families largely hail) often resting precisely on the contentious issue of Western support for Israel *because* of the holocaust, to the detriment of certain Muslim populations (the Palestinians) who have their cause taken up by people the West has been in conflict with (Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden) on the basis of ideological necessity (as Muslims, not fellow Arabs or anything)


SO 

the circumstance that these people are trying to avoid is:

1) A fuck ton of angry Muslims protesting 

2) maybe some awkward incident where a student protest against being made to be 'educated' on the Holocaust (which in the view of many Muslims simply didn't justify the West's creation and subsequent support of Israel) *at* a Holocaust site

3) the need to think about what it means for immigrant populations to be *so* different from the native one on core issues of identity and nationality and ethnicity and religion - - - if you can't *see* the problem, it's not a problem!


___________________________________________________

That's all retarded because:

1) Germany is a modern, Western nation, and the post-WW2 Pax Americana says, among its other dictums,  that immigration happens, and you assimilate those immigrants into your society and make them your own people. 

2) Germany clearly has the material resources to achieve that ideal; it's not like they're hurting for money or are bad at education.

3) This just blatantly suggests hypocrisy for not exempting other immigrant/children of immigrant students:

For instance:

If Dieter Krause and Dorothea Bacher  as ""German"" Germans are expected to make the school trip to Auschwitz (or wherever), because of all of the reasons of post-war West Germany/Germany's insistence that a deliberate, difficult, and cathartic reckoning with the history of 'their people' happen for young Germans who will be the next generation of the German people:

* are Mert Baykara and Fulya Boztepe as Muslim students whose parents immigrated from Turkey in 1993  to be exempted?

* are Dawid Gwozdek and Zuzanna Pokorny also going to be exempted because they have Polish ancestry as Germans whose families have lived for a long, long time in Germany (even being victims during the Nazi era)? 

* What about the American exchange student Reginald Pierce whose ancestors were predominately from Africa? 


Is the exemption about religion?

About how ""long"" it takes for someone to be ""German"" with all that comes with? 

Is there going to be an ethnic division in Germans and ""German"" Germans? 

Is there going to be an explicitly racial one? 

Is there going to be difference in the expectations of someone just temporarily being a part of the German nation? 

All of these matter, because they all deal with what it means to be German, what it means for Germany to come to terms with the Holocaust, what it means for the place and function of immigration in Germany, *and this party wants to ignore all of that*.

They are attempting to purchase social harmony by pretending there isn't any discord.

This is the sociological equivalent of continuing a small talk conversation about the music and food at a party while a fire grows larger and larger in the adjacent room.

America does it on immigration of people who require Spanish on voting and safety instructions and can't stomach being an English only nation, let alone  require immigrants to conceive of themselves as ""American"", Europe does it on immigration of people who are Muslims first and who don't really identify as part of the nation, either, but both the USA and EU are doing it.

America does it because its politically convenient to turn some red states blue, Europe does it because many of their political sectors have achieved horseshoe theory with Social Justice priorities being oppressive of common sense, but *both do it*.

Carriers cost ungodly amounts of money not only to create, but to maintain. What makes you think these vessels don't have defense capabilities for all the things you just named. I mean its obvious the US know very well the strength of sub surface craft as we employ the largest fleet in the world. America has 78 world class subs in almost constant 24/7 operation. Second place would indeed be Russia with 62, however many of those are early cold war era (that's a pretty big deal) and only God knows when and how many are actually operational at any given moment. 

When something as expensive and destructive as a carrier deploys it is accompanied by a very very large entourage of vessels from every class, to include the sub surface class. Meaning to get to the Carrier you would not only have to get by all the other vessels, but more importantly also the unknown number of the best nuclear subs in the world guarding it. 

Ok lets put that aside and throw it out there that a carrier is alone.

As far as sub surface goes depending on the number it would not be the best scenario, however all carriers have counter sub surface warfare. Meaning it has weapons that can in fact destroy a sub marine. This however is not the point nor the strength for this ship class. It is a carrier and obviously has aircraft onboard, many with armaments and capabilities designed specifically and only to find and kill sub surface threats. Think [this] (http://breakingdefense.com/2011/07/p-8-sub-killer-plane-makes-first-flight/).

Now as far as missiles go there are many different ways to handle this. Obviously we have aircraft that can conduct search and destroy on targets miles and miles away. A missile is not different then another plane in this instance as we have missile systems design to take down other missile systems mid flight. However, lets say they sent an ungodly amount of small missiles, well thats what the [Sea wiz] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUfiPRrbMw) is for. Best believe these multi billion dollar vessels have more then enough of them. Now lets talk about the very long range missiles you brought up. These systems use a geological tracking system from satellites very similar to GPS, well its almost the exact same as GPS. So this makes it almost impossible to hit a nuclear powered moving target. These system are for hitting structures not moving targets.

A carrier is a floating city with over 5,000 onboard at any given moment and is extremely precious to us and therefore extremely protected. When a US carrier pulls in to a port/sea/body of water it immediately becomes the most dominate military power for the entire region, this is globally (yes, even for Russia or China).

TL:DR, There is no real threat to a carrier as of yet in military history. Think Humans to other animals, we have no natural predator, yet.

When I inform people that the Indian act was NOT intended to be advantageous to our peoples, those whom are uninformed and aren't aware of the history of that specific branch of government and are generally in disbelief.  

For those that are curious, the book Stolen Continents written by Ronald Wright goes into detail about the Maya, Inca, Aztec, Cherokee, and Iroquois and each of their time and effects felt during the vast time of the process of colonization. 

In the book there's a lot of really eye opening stances and quotes regarding our government and it's Indian act.  Maybe this is something to consider when most try to weigh the cultural genocide in relation to other peoples, nations, and cultures worldwide.

""The genocide of native peoples in North America is a lesson that was not wasted on Adolph Hitler and his final solution of the Jewish problem.

 It is readily acknowledged that Indian children lose their natural resistance to illness by habituating so closely in the residential schools and that they die at a much higher rate than in their villages. But this does not justify a change in the policy of this Department which is geared towards a final solution of our Indian Problem.""  - Duncan Campbell Scott""

Same with the treaties. The current bullshit about 'promises made in our verbal history' is so without merit. The treaties were basically designed in the scheme of ""In exchange for us not exterminating you from existence we will get your land and everyone you are in exchange for nothing.""

At first I think you're not wrong. Obviously Canada hasn't built Auschwitz and started killing natives enmass. 

The reality I think is that there are the native bands who cling to the indian act because they think at some point the indian act will change to leave them benefited and superior to everyone else in Canada where they receive all the benefits but none of the disadvantages. That'll never ever happen. Even if somehow that became the case and the natives were the upperclass. The next federal government would just change it such that basically all Canadian citizens are natives and therefore eliminating the advantages.

1) Torture does not and HAS NOT provided any useful information for stopping terrorist attacks, this is a fact. 

http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/12/09/3601209/cia-torture-report-findings/

At no time did the CIAs coercive interrogation techniques lead to the collection of imminent threat intelligence, such as the hypothetical ticking time bomb information that many believe was the justification for the use of these techniques.

It is well known that torture is not a good way to obtain valuable information. It never has been.

2) Torture contributes to the rise of terrorism

Torturing innocent people creates more hatred and fear in the Muslim world. When people see these atrocities they are obviously going to be angry. Doing things like this creates more terrorists, what happens to the innocent people who are tortured, do you think they are going to come out peaceful and loving America?

22% of people held by the CIA were not supposed to be there..

3) Not going to war helps America defend itself. 

- Frees up military resources for actual defense of the united states. Imagine how much extra protection the US would have if it spent all on its money on homeland defense, instead of wars in Iraq and the middle east.

- Invading countries causes a rise in extremism.

""The rise in terrorist activity coincided with the US invasion of Iraq,""

""This point -- that war breeds violence -- is not particularly novel or satisfying. But the fact that Afghanistan and Iraq continue to top the list of countries most affected by terrorism does highlight the limitations of foreign military intervention in ending terrorist violence.""

That's what usually happens.  The myriad of bronze and iron age societies conquering each other, the Romans conquering anyone, the Normans conquering Anglo-Saxons, the British conquering anyone.  The new regime comes in and says you're not allowed to live the old way anymore, you need to play by the new rules.

Generally there have been a few possible outcomes to that:

- Over time the conquered society is integrated and dissolved into the conquering society (Normans and Anglo-Saxons became the British)
- The conquering society eventually leaves for some reason and the conquered society remains (the Briton culture remained following the Romans' pulling out after a 400-year rule)
- The conquered society fights back and is either victorious and gets their own country, or gets annihilated and ceases to exist
