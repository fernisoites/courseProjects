1,"""Unfortunately, House Republicans refused to give the Senate bill an up-or-down vote.

Thats why the President took action to fix as much of the broken system as he could through his immigration accountability executive actions. These actions will help secure the border, prioritize felons, not families, and hold undocumented immigrants accountable by requiring them to pass a criminal background check and pay their fair share of taxes, and modernizes the legal immigration system. These are common-sense steps, but only Congress can finish the job.

Three critical elements of the President's executive actions are:

    Cracking Down on Illegal Immigration at the Border: The Presidents actions increase the chances that anyone attempting to cross the border illegally will be caught and sent back. Continuing the surge of resources that effectively reduced the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally this summer, the Presidents actions will also centralize border security command-and-control to continue to crack down on illegal immigration.
    Deporting Felons, Not Families: The Presidents actions focus on the deportation of people who threaten national security and public safety. He has directed immigration enforcement to place anyone suspected of terrorism, violent criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers at the top of the deportation priority list.
    Accountability  Criminal Background Checks and Taxes: The President is also acting to hold accountable those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years and are parents of U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents. By registering and passing criminal and national security background checks, millions of undocumented immigrants will start paying their fair share of taxes and temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation for three years at a time.

The Presidents actions will also streamline legal immigration to boost our economy and will promote naturalization for those who qualify.""

17,"The article you mentioned talks about redistricting and the effect that redistricting has had versus previous district boundaries, but never specifically mentions gerrymandering.

&gt; Republican legislators and governors drew district lines for 173 of the 435 seats in Congress.[9] Where Republican legislators controlled redistricting, Republicans likely won 11 more seats than they would have under the old district lines. Five of these 11 were seats that flipped party control due to redistricting; six were Republican seats saved by redistricting. **In states where Republicans controlled redistricting, Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats. But even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats.**

&gt; Democratic legislators and governors redistricted 44 seats, just one-quarter the number of seats as Republicans.[10] But they still used redistricting to their advantage. Where they controlled redistricting, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, and Republicans lost five more seats. **In the six states where Democrats controlled redistricting, Democratic candidates for the House won about 56 percent of the vote and 71 percent of the seats. However, that disparity would have persisted even before redistricting, as Democrats would have likely won 61 percent of the seats under the old district lines.**

So what they're saying here may be a little unclear to the reader. It doesn't imply that the previous district boundaries were reasonable.

What it does say flat out is that in Republican-controlled states Republican candidates won 53% of the vote and 72% of the seats, versus the 65% of seats they would have won under the old already-Gerrymandered district lines.

It also says flat out that in the Democratic-controlled states, Democratic candidates got 56% of the vote but won 71% of the seats. That is an increase from 61% under the previous already-gerrymandered district lines.

In fact, the article you linked to doesn't contain a single instance of the word ""gerrymander"" or ""gerrymandered"".

The statistics you posted indicate some very substantial increases of the difference between the percentage of seats that would have been won based on voting percentage versus the percentage that were won based on the new district guidelines. This seems to me like a very good indication that gerrymandering is being used effectively to make the results not match the votes. And again, yes, the study I originally linked to was for North Carolina specifically, but it did indicate that there were almost no way that certain particular things could have happened without gerrymandering, like saying
&gt; Nonetheless it is interesting to note the racial makeup of the districts created by
our model and compare them to the current figures. Figure 7 gives the results for
the African American and Hispanic populations. Our samples never produced a majority
African American district. 

So when creating a system to draw district guidelines based on possible priorities that could be used and that were not specifically intending to isolate African-American voters into just two districts, their models  **never** produced a majority African-American district.

Saying that nationally ""The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under the old district lines,"" is **not** the same as saying ""The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under reasonable district lines.""

And this isn't to say that Democrats didn't gerrymander. The fact that Republicans gerrymander does not mean that Democrats didn't gerrymander where they had power. The ""only six seats"" thing is a red herring in so many different ways. It's also not like ""Well all seats are districted reasonably, except these six gerrymandered seats."" The ""six seats"" thing is such a useless bit of information for this discussion.

This is a social issue; the wage gap is something that emerges as women embark on careers and attempt to rise up in businesses. It comes about for many reasons, some of which equal pay laws address, and some of which they do not. Part of the wage gap is caused by beliefs about how women perform in the workplace at certain jobs--for example, that women are worse at math and science than men. These societal biases can cause some (note: not all) male bosses at some (please note again: not all, or even most) companies to invest more time and give more attention to male employees.

Another big factor for some jobs is maternity/paternity leave policies in America. Oddly enough, Republicans object to addressing that, too.

I think that if the republican party wants to dominate they should shift to libertarian viewpoints... end the war overseas, the war on drugs, stop worrying about gay marriage, religion etc... and focus on the economics of it all..

no more corporate welfare
no bailouts
no subsidizing the farmers
no more crony capitalism 
lower taxes
less red tape for business owners
less trade restriction 

if they do that.. you might see people in the middle or who slightly lean left jump on board with them..

hillary is the worst of the worst democrats.. and a republican ( someone like Justin Amash) who said those things I mentioned on a national level and platform.. you would see a huge changing of the guard ( I think)

Do you know of a good link to his detailed plan for this. I am assuming there must be one for you to be so excited. Because most people know nine times out of ten it is just lip service on the part of the politician. And when it comes to republicans almost always boils down to tax cuts and abolishing capital gains taxes and estate taxes. Which yes would in some way simplify things. But would be realistically unworkable and in fact do more harm than good. 

&gt;Obamacare with something that gives people more choice

Where is his detailed plan for this? This is the same empty rhetoric republicans have spouted for 6 years. They have tried to repeal 50 to 60 tines. And to this day have not suggested a single workable replacement. And again this is nothing new or different. It is standard boilerplate rhetoric every republican has run on since the passage of the ACA. 

&gt;opening the books at the Federal Reserve

There are bigger fish to fry than the fed. And I say that as no big fan of theirs.  But again. This is just empty rhetoric on the part of Cruz. He has no actual road map or idea here. It is just one of those things certain people like to hear. Red meat buzz words that excite specific groups regardless of the fact nothing will change. Nearly every republican candidate for the last decade had said the same. 

&gt;and in general sending back power from Washington DC to the states,

This is a rather genuinely horrible idea. One only needs to look at many of the unconstitutional abortion restrictions red states are wasting millions of their tax payers money defending against the inevitable. As well as many of the same states being on the wrong side of modern civil rights issues. As well as little to no safety or environmental protections in them. The states rights rallying cry is again more empty rhetoric that could never actually work but it's trotted out every single election cycle.

This is already happening. Only with the system we have it will eventually be legal everywhere. If it were left to state's rights it would never be legalized many places.

130,"&gt;  everyone in the media and the pundits and everyone who keeps your mind set of thinking the people who would vote for the old way thought obama would be a complete failure.

That's not true at all. Obama actually received a [fairly significant level of establishment support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Endorsements). By this time in 2007, [he was polling](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html) within 10 points of Clinton. Along with Edwards, and Clinton, Obama was treated as a top rate candidate, though Clinton had been considered the presumptive nominee from the start. And on that note, [Clinton's position in 2016 outpaces her position in 2008](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-iowa-2016/); the ""inevitability"" of her in 2008 is not at all comparable to the same claim for 2016. (Not that the last bit is particularly relevant, but but it could be later in the discussion and I wanted to pre-note that.)

&gt; lastly i dont think rubio has a chance at all. the republican's have long since been using the southern strategy and they've attracted a base that is a fairly racist. they're not going to vote a latino, even if he's from their party, to presidency.

I think this is a misapplication of assessments. Republicans have shown they're more than willing to elect minorities that follow the party-line on issues. Bobby Jindal, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Brian Sandoval, Susana Martinez, Mia Love, Will Hurd, Allen West, Ral Labrador...

And that's not touching on the big unelected republicans that get lots of support, like Ben Carson, Collin Powell, or Condoleezza Rice. Or hell, look at Romney -- he didn't lose any noteworthy support with evangelical voters despite being a Mormon.

Republicans will happily support people of whatever background -- just as long as they're ""right"" (to the republican voter) on the issues. Racism today is systemic and passive, rather than individual and active: where the republican party is racist is via their policy stances and as a magnifier of already existing dislike -- not through large-scale inherent outright rejection of someone for their race or ethnicity.

On the flipside, I'm not going to argue that Rubio is going to *gain* any significant hispanic support just because he himself is hispanic. He'll be opposed by the majority of them for the same reason the majority of republicans would support him: his policy stances.

&gt; as for rubio's charisma i'm not so sure. he has the same charisma as romney, he's robotic.

Sorry but I can't agree with that at all. Watch Rubio in an interview or speaking. I don't agree with him or even like him, but he's clearly a politician that knows how to speak well for himself. Romney had no ability to relate to people or even pretend he could relate to people: almost every time he spoke he reinforced some negative perception of him. Rubio doesn't suffer from that. [Charismatic is perhaps the single most often used adjective to describe Rubio](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/young-marco-rubio-stuns-media-with-his-charisma.html) -- and it's not by accident.

For my $0.02, as a progressive: Rubio is likely the most dangerous republican in the race right now. He has a path to the nomination, and would be able to make a politically valuable contrast with any plausible democratic nominees.

Also, in general, Democrats have to convince more people to give money than Republicans, as there are fewer big-money donors who support Democratic causes than Republican ones.

199,"Again, we're not on the same page. These *are* fringe politics in American culture *because* the political parties are monolithic. That's my point entirely. The tail wags the dog.

In European politics (because of the parliamentary system) it is possible for small political parties like Front National with 13% of the vote to be legitimate parties. This would never happen in American politics. They would simply get co-opted by either side like the Tea Party was absorbed by the Right.

The point I'm trying to make is that American politics has been corrupted into a one-size-fits-all mess where all the issues are absorbed into an ocean that is divided by the absolute minimal difference, namely the conservative movement and the progressive movement.

&gt; You're making ridiculous assumptions from the opening paragraphs of a wikipedia page. Look at the actual policies which they advocate, and see if you find that anywhere in either American party. Republicans have been trying to co-opt the Hispanic vote from the Democrats by pandering to Catholic sensibilities, a far cry from actual ethnic nationalism.

You're missing the woods for the trees by delving into the minutia. That's not what this conversation is about. It's about the fact that American politics has evolved into a beast that doesn't allow for parties to exist outside of the big two. In Europe the very fact that you're even *able* to have a reactionary party shows just how far Right American politics is because here we can't do that. American politics has become *so* conservative that the establishment hasn't just shifted to the Right during the past forty years but it has effectively become a single party. The Democrats have largely forgotten their old policies on higher taxes on the wealthy and affordable education and now the only thing that really differentiates them from the Right are their social policies.

What really explains your understanding of all this to me however is this:

&gt; ...the Republicans are thoroughly...multicultural, mass immigration...

That's simply not true. It seems that you have a completely different take on where the pulse of the Right in America currently is. That's probably why you see this so differently.",2,0.0719887955182,0.125582000625,0.399906629318,0.28084158779,0.550476190476,1.0,376,0.085201793722,18.8,0.0229166666667,0.4125

201,"No. Certainly a third party candidate in a system like ours does have the potential to harm the political candidate from a mainstream party that is closest to them, but the bigger issue for Gore was that many Democrats were very frustrated with Bill Clinton's neoliberal third way policies and Gore campaigned as a continuation of that, not as a left candidate. All of his climate change activism didn't come until after the election was over. At that time was also the height of the fair trade/anti-glob protests, which started under Clinton and were much larger and more intense than occupy. Meanwhile, George Bush was campaigning as a centrist, nothing like how he ended up once in power. So, Gore lost voters since less turned out to vote and even some registered Democrats voted for Bush, maybe thinking he would roll back on the neoliberalism (nothing to do with ""liberal"" as used in the US). More registered Democrats voted for Bush than Nader.

The exact opposite is the case, she's actually one of the most popular politicians in America, in fact in polls only her husband has a higher favourability rating. She is double digits ahead of ANY other potential presidential candidate, on EITHER side. 

She's only hated by extreme Republicans because she's high profile and the Democrat front runner, it's not like the far right of the Republican party is going to start loving Sanders, a self described socialist/social democrat if he gets the nomination. They don't hate him only because they've never given him a thought before. On policy, Clinton has A LOT more appeal to moderate Republicans than Sanders does. Sanders will get zero Republican votes, Clinton could actually well pick up a fair few moderates, particularly if the Republicans nominate a nutcase (which is entirely possible). Sanders also has the possibility of losing centrist Democrats while left wing Democrats will grudgingly vote for Clinton over a Republican.

239,"&gt;the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology voted Thursday to cut deeply into NASA's budget for Earth science, in a clear swipe at the study of climate change.

After this clearly opinionated opening, I can't wait for this ""journalist"" to *show* his thesis as opposed to just *telling* us what he thinks the Republicans were doing in decreasing this particular spending.  And I can't wait to read the quotes from Republicans that the author of this piece, Michael Hiltzik, surely sought out.

&gt;The budget plan perfectly reflects the House GOP's glorification of space exploration, which masks its disdain for research on climate change.

Again, the author is *telling* us the intentions of the Republicans.  I look forward to him *showing* us, via facts or quotes, about these intentions.

&gt;The Earth Science division, the organization continued, helped monitor the movement of oil into Gulf of Mexico coastal waters after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, track severe storms and tornadoes, and assisted with flood predictions and earthquake response. 

I appreciate the fear mongering, but the author never elaborates on why things like this couldn't *still happen* with NASA's proposed budget of $1.45 BILLION.  And that's not even NASA's entire budget.  That's the budget for the Earth Science department of NASA.  

&gt;Earth science got one mention, and that one was an undisguised political slam: ""The Obama administration has consistently cut funding for ... human space exploration programs, **while increasing funding for the Earth Science Division by more than 63 percent.**""

If this is true, it's not even a cut.  If Obama increases it 63% and the Republicans cut it 20%, that's still a net increase in funding.  

&gt;What kind, indeed? This kind.

And the author never *shows* us this ""clear swipe at the study of climate change"" by the Republicans.  He simply told us his opinion about it and portrayed it as fact.  Forget any quotes from Republicans or any context into the historical budget of the Earth Science division, let's just write an article based entirely on the author's opinion and only feature quotes from people who agree with the author.

265,"So according to you the onus is obviously on me, yet as I said, it was you who originally made the statement.

You seem to be arguing from your own socialist perspective, from which socialism is primarily an economic concern (I had read some of your other posts). You seem mostly concerned that the super rich aren't paying for the education and healthcare that would boost the very poor. This is one marginal issue for which I care very little, and agree with on some scale. I should point out that I am Canadian, and appreciate being able to be injured without also being bankrupted. To clarify, this is your original statement:
&gt;the right is pretty much the entire main stream spectrum

Compared to Europe, there are facets of American politics that make less concessions to the welfare-state model practiced by most European countries. That only puts America on the right of the ""mainstream"" spectrum in your perspective, as what constitutes the mainstream in America has been pushed so far to the left that it doesn't remember what the right is. If your mainstream spectrum starts at global socialism and ends at economic unions of liberal democracies, than America may appear as a conniving fascistic demon. As I have repeatedly said, our viewpoints are so different that we do not even percieve terms in any familiar way.

I am arguing from a perspective where, specifically *marxism*, refers to the destruction of traditional elements of society so that way can be repaved for society to be reconstructed on these egalitarian(cough) redistributionist principles, and that to believe this dream can be realized and isn't a vehicle for an already privileged elite to consolidate their power and wipe out competitors isn't as I said akin to a street gang, is denial. So when we look at things like corporate revenues, we see an arm of this privileged elite that isn't playing by the rules that are dictated by all the lawyers and committees at their behest. The slice of the pie that should be allocated to regional governments is instead paid up to a ""boss"" at a higher level than US politics. Governments are run by individuals, who have always been more powerful than supposed collectives. Suggesting we hand over power exclusively to a single, small collective puts power in the hands of less individuals, and the inevitable result has been the so called testing of communism in every country that has tried it. Look at the rise of cartels in Latin America and Mafias in Eurasia. These cartels are the beneficaries of regulation, they are in essence parallel governments with their own methods of policing their own regulations, and are only held accountable when their enemies use the same strategies. The same goes for business conglomerates that owns swathes of the world economy. The strategy is simple, appeal to the poorest for help bringing down their rising competitors. We have proof this is how the world operates and it's called the entirety of written history.

What is presented by the elites as mainstream alternatives are completely controlled, and I agree that forays into various religious and minority rights are a massive distraction from the complete domination of our planet by those at the very top. The only modern difference is that the real people at the top, the ones with the money and power and connections to change the world are no longer kings, popes, emperors, and aristocrats, they are largely non-public faceless suits with secret bank accounts hiding behind boards and committees in gated estates worlds away. If this sounds like it has a conspiratorial slant to it, it does, you can never take your enemies at their word, especially if they have something to lose by telling the truth. 

Our perspectives have such a large difference in source and spirit that it would probably be completely futile and even trigger a complete shutdown of reasonable debate if I were to bring the to connection to international Jewry. That you are surprised such a progressive publication as the New York Times is a tool for shaping political narrative for neocons is again illustrative of the huge divide between our perspectives. The neocons are not right wing, they are the antithesis to the right wing, they seek to reinforce the established hegemony of international finance's stranglehold over developing countries. The ""fringe right wing"", which in your perspective is so far right that it is not worth considering as part of the political spectrum, seeks a complete divorce from such international meddling on behalf of international actors. We seem to both agree that Democrats and Republicans are puppets of our real enemies, yet you are taking the word of the puppet's puppets as evidence of actual public opinion.

My definition of marxism is that of Churchill's that it is a **world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality.**

To distill my opinion in that of the gang metaphor, I would prefer to see power diffused as widely as possible across as many small gangs as possible, rather than concentrated amongest one gang so as to police its errant subjects. Marxism/socialism is a dream fueled by capricious envy which will never realize the former, it is simply a vehicle for the latter.

Nine out of the ten states with the lowest fertility rates - also below replacement - are blue states, and nine out of the ten with the highest are red. Liberals, no - *white* liberals - are big on self extinction. It's no surprise that they see this controversy from the perspective they do. Raising the next generation honestly just isn't that high on the list of priorities.  

My point is that people can, with good intentions and in good faith and without any malice at all, oppose extending state recognition to gay marriage. It doesn't mean you hate gay people and want them ridiculed back into the closet. It might just mean that you're apprehensive about tinkering with something as important as marriage, an institution that is already on the ropes thanks to every previous liberal offensive into this arena.  

At any rate, some 40% of Republicans are just fine with gay marriage. Of the remainder, I'm sure there are some homophobes. But to say that it's the objective of the Republican Party that we return to a time when ""gays are ridiculed and forced to keep a secret instead of living life as who they are and contributing to the greater good of society"" is just hyperbolic.

If my fault is that my mainstream spectrum starts at global socialism and ends at economic unions of liberal democracies then yours would be that your mainstream spectrum starts at the subverted rights of the individual and ends with the rise of Nietzsche's Superman.

If that is your metric then you've reduced all of human history to one grand, continuous conspiracy where the only thing that changes are the faces.

You say things like this:

&gt; We seem to both agree that Democrats and Republicans are puppets of our real enemies, yet you are taking the word of the puppet's puppets as evidence of actual public opinion.

and then never expand on them. How do *you* gauge public opinion? Of course the New York Times is part of the establishment. You don't think I understand that but I do. But on top of that, I recognize that the press has throughout history generally been to the left of the state. I also understand is that living as both an absolutist and an ideologue is impossible.

You're right. The world will never be fair and people will never realize the extent to which everything is controlled but your standards come from a place of such naivety that you cut yourself off from any and all discussion.

You want to diversify power and think that there's currently one big room with a few people controlling the entire world. You're right in some ways and wrong in others. Sure, there is an incredibly tiny amount of people controlling everything but they're *not* always all sitting in the same room making secret deals and agreements in the way you think they are. Of course treaties are made, laws are passed secretly, borders are negotiated and quid pro quo is par for the course. But these elites do it to themselves too. Competition has always been far too great for a single cabal to control the way you think they do.

You bring up international Jewry like it's one huge secret that only you and the White Aryan Resistance are keen to. I know that Israel wags the dog of the U.S., Hollywood, Wall Street, and the U.N., among others but I also know that they're just the flavor of the century and there are far too many cogs in the wheel for it to be on purpose. Israel runs on guilt and are really the first state to exist in such a unique fashion. But you know what? Israel's power will wane in time when people grow tired of its politics or the Middle East runs out of oil. That's how these things go.

But I'm also careful to know when and how to keep my concerns in check. They don't have the sort of power you deftly imply they do. I mean that's quite a roundabout way to horde all the gold, isn't it?: let's subvert the governments of all of Europe and most of the other positions in the world through finance and then when the time is right secure the Third Temple but only give ourselves one of the tiniest scraps of land in the Middle East with no oil. It's ridiculous.

People take as much as they can as fast as they can wherever they can. History has shown this. People don't *want* to play the long game. They want it *now*. That is one of the reasons why conspiracies are so unrealistic.

290,"...What? Sheldon Richman is not a socialist. Even if he were, it would make no difference. The laissez-faire nature of the Gilded Age is only considered mythical by fringe libertarian groups. Like Richman for example, who points to the benefits of increased economic growth as the result of market competition, and the negative features of the time, like extreme worker abuse, on government regulation. This is nonsense according to any honest interpretation of the facts.

No one suggests that the Gilded Age is an example of a perfectly free market. That would be nonsense. However it was certainly the most laissez faire period of American history and was marked by a *lack of involvement and regulation* by government in the activities of business in most industries, whether it was coal mining, steel and iron work, textiles, logging, etc. In these industries you saw an extreme lack of consideration for the well being of working people, and a lack of desire on the part of government to do anything about it. Very few pieces of legislation were passed in this time.

The notion that if only the market was *more free* during this time of plentiful unskilled labor, normal working people would have been better off, goes against the most basic principles of economics. The market is a machine that will steamroll people if the conditions warrant it, and they often do.

&gt; The political situation in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th Century was a gridlock, very much as it has been recently. Even though Republicans won three of the five Presidential elections between 1876 and 1896 they did not win a majority of the popular vote in any of them. There were only four years when Republicans controlled both the White House and both houses of Congress. There were only two years when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House. Government simply was not a factor in the economy during this time.

&gt;When there was a panic in the financial markets, like the one in 1893 that led to a depression for the entire second term of President Grover Cleveland, J.P. Morgan, the head of the most powerful Wall Street bank, stabilized the banking system by putting his firm's capital into the market to prevent some banks from failing. The government had no authority, means, or will, to act. Morgan also intervened in the same way in the 1907 bank panic that resulted in a protracted recession that finally prompted the first effort to regulate the banks through the creation of the Federal Reserve System. However, the structure and powers of the Federal Reserve System were designed by bankers, meeting in secret, at a Morgan estate.[8]

&gt; It was during the second half of the 19th Century that laissez-faire industrial capitalism became dominant and known by that term.  Laissez-faire meant leave business alone, and business was left alone by the government until early in the 20th Century. The concept is popularly believed to have come from Adam Smith whose Wealth of Nations,[9] first published in 1776, greatly influenced economic thought in the 19th Century. He argued that business operated most effectively and efficiently when guided by what he called the invisible hand of market forces.[10] That concept was misinterpreted as advocating laissez-faire, essentially a complete absence of government regulation, or involvement in business, which Smith did not advocate. And the term laissez-faire never appears in his work. However, using Smith as the authority, laissez-faire was converted by various thinkers into a philosophical underpinning of capitalism and the free enterprise system, as if it were an essential element.

Also, you should be aware of the fact that unless you're a super rich perosn, the Republicans have overseen arguably the greatest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in US history. So when you say Republicans arent taking anything from you, you are intensely wrong. Their policies shift the burden from high earners to low earners for everything that makes society function. Your hard earned money is going toward paying for things that until recently society agreed the rich ought to pay most for.

Sometimes mutually opposed groups can find common ground in weird ways. Ever hear a black nationalist rant about how African-Americans need to get out of America? They sounds shockingly like neo-Nazis (insofar as both groups want blacks to leave). The same thing happened in World War II where the World Zionist Congress actually worked with the Nazis because they both had aligned interests: Getting Jews to leave Europe.

Before the Final Solution, Hitler toyed with sending Jews to Palestine. The World Zionist Congress--in this pre-Holocaust period--had been working toward the same goal for decades. So when Hitler started making things uncomfortable for Jews, there were Zionists who actually welcomed it--because it might trigger a mass exodus from Europe (which is what they wanted).

So in this bizarre paradox, for a brief period, both Nazis and Jews were working toward the same goal. (Of course things went off kilter when England forbade the deportation of Jews to Palestine. They didn't want to destabilize the region after taking it over from the Ottomans.)

But no matter....

In modern US politics, there's occasional overlap between right and left. Both leftist civil rights groups and rightwing civil libertarians want more freedom. They also have a deep distrust of crony-capitalism. They both also have a deep populist streak to them.

This is why Ron Paul initially poached so many young Democrats. They liked his pro-freedom, anti-war message.

Today, conservatives who are pro-freedom and anti-war are called paleo-conservatives. We were the anti-internationalists (while the Democrats were historically the internationalist party). The Democrats wanted to involve the US in the League of Nations (under Woodrow Wilson) while the Republicans fought it tooth and nail.

Conservatives have ALWAYS been anti-war and pro-freedom.

Don't ever confuse a real conservative for a neocon chickenhawk. The neocons emerged from the Scoop Jackson branch of the Democratic party.

I consider neocons Democrats.

Always sabre-rattling and always willing to involve the US in international wars.

Jeb Bush is just like them: a RINO (Republican in Name Only.) 99% of his political positions are the same as Hillary Clinton's. 

I'd prefer Bernie Sanders because we have aligned interests insofar as 1) He's anti-Too Big To Fail. To me socialism for Wall Street is still socialism. When companies behave recklessly, I believe that they should be allowed to go out of business. Their deaths would stand as object lessons for other companies considering shady practices. 2) He's for civil liberties. 3) He's populist and believes in placing working Americans first.

&gt;Unless you can prove to me that whatever is being cut from NASA is somehow producing results that directly link man to causing changes in the weather I'm not interested.

Honestly it matters only a little about what part of NASA funding we are cutting (I think it is underfunded already, though I'm sure they have some waste like any government project), however I do not know the specifics of what is being cut. I do know that NASA says man made climate change is real. I also know that the GOP is very hypocritical in how they choose to cut items in the budget and why.

335,"Sanders points out a key item in this 1989 video: that if you keep voting for the ""lesser evil"" you will accomplish nothing.

If you think about this it's a no-brainer and is supported by many historical examples.

Even in a losing effort, a so-called ""third party"" (the phrase is propaganda to make us to think that only Republocrats and Demopublicans are the ""legitimate"" parties) will shift the ruling duopoly of political parties.

The Progressives in Vermont are a classic example. By the Progressives winning some seats in the state legislature (and Sanders, of course), it shifts the entire political spectrum! Democrats move to the left and Republicans moderate themselves.

We saw a similar shift with Ross Perot's 1992 presidential run. Perot's main campaign platform was fiscal responsibility and a balanced budget. The billionaire Perot bought 19% of the vote but he still lost badly. The result? Perot pressured both halves of our ruling political duopoly to act on the issue to negate Perot; this resulted in Clinton's balanced budgets.

Will this mean that some ""lesser evil"" candidates lose elections?

Yes, but as the old saying goes, you've to to break some eggs to make an omelette. What those losses will mean is that their future candidates shift to co-opt the so-called ""third party"". (This is how FDR dealt with socialists winning elections during the Great Depression.)

At any rate though, that doesn't change the damaging influence money has in politics even for the Democrats. Obama has ties to Goldman Sachs and other Wallstreet firms. Guess who wasn't punished when they caused the financial system to melt down? 

That wiped out lots of people's savings, caused them to lose their jobs, etc. It was severely damaging to the middle class and poor.

* She accepts the scientific facts of human contribution to global climate change and would continue and accelerate policies to help us transition from fossil fuel to renewable. 

* She supports obamacare and has pushed for single payer in the past

* She aggressively opines against income inequality, for social wealth redistribution, and isn't against new taxes. She supports a raised minimum wage, universal pre-k education, and mandatory maternity and paternity leave. 

I mean, if you base your vote on Hillary's opinions of video games from 2005, good on you I guess, but I'm primarily interested in: Economy, Energy, Role of the Federal Government.

We can't let republicans trash the economy with massive unfunded tax cuts _again_! We can't finish the process of adjudicating our role as technological leader in energy! Minimum wage is already lower than it's been in half a century against inflation... and shrinking: the poor and middle class are barely holding on here. We can't survive a radical conservative, not without the immolation and phoenixing that the radicals worship. 

Remember the Republicans universally disagree with every point above. Deny climate science, get rid of EPA protection, stop incentivizing alternative energy, give the bank away to the oil companies. Allow mega-mergers, cut corporate taxes. Income inequality is radically increasing? Cut taxes on the top 0.01%! They want (and are getting closer) to destroying healthcare reform and reducing our system to their  true goal of ""care only for those who can pay (read: basic capitalism)"" . They have no solution for the twelve million illegal immigrants except to continue to the disgusting status quo of second-class citizens. And biggest of all, Republicans want to slash social spending and cut taxes, so they can destroy welfare while continuing the deficit, so they continue to use the deficit as justification to end national spending in sciences, national spending for alternative energy, national spending on education, and of course, national spending on welfare and income inequality. They're already slashing budgets like NASA and illegalizing the mention of climate change, and putting low-iq faith leaders in positions of power over the sciences. 

I just hope you realize that Republicans control Senate and without a Democrat in the White House, we are going to see radical conservative policy become National Law. That ""disagreeing with Snowden"" is going to be the least of your worries during the second gilded age, after the minimum wage is abolished all together and healthcare is rendered into a full pay-for-service-upfront only system. 

You can harp on Snowden and violent video games, but losing more to income inequality, losing Social Security, the EPA, gay civil rights, and a thousand more important things are on the line.

373,"Well, since you ask so nicely.

Overall: The premise is that had Bernie decided to challenge Shumlin for the Gubernatorial office, he could have used that position as a base to build a statewide Progressive Party analogous to the organization he built in Burlington.  That's unlikely, and here is why:

- All Vermont politics is intensely personal.  Bernie has a strong *personal* following (he's not a nice guy, but he's widely seen as honest and straightforward), rather like a fiscally conservative Republican Governor, Richard Snelling.  Snelling was downright rude, abrasive and difficult to deal with.  But he kept getting elected, and when he retired he was succeeded by a liberal Democrat (Madeline Kunin) who proceeded to muck up the budget.  Snelling came back and fixed it again with a stunning deal between him and the powerful Democratic leader of Congress.  It was Snelling's unexpected fatal heart attack that put then Lt. Governor Howard Dean - remember him? - into the Governor position.  Dean, brilliantly, immediately announced that he hadn't been elected to anything, was going to implement Snelling's program and leave Snelling's people in place in the government.  Vermonters thought this was pretty classy and re-elected Dean in his own right with a massive majority.  So Vermont had a very fiscally conservative (and rude) Governor, followed by a Liberal (and wishy washy - she was known as ""Straddlin' Madeline"") spendthrift, followed by a ""Jeezum Crow, I gotta clean up the f*cking mess *again*?"" return, followed by a moderate Democrat who acted like a conservative Republican and fought tooth and nail with the Progressive wing of his own party.  Dean called them ""kooks"" and ""nutcases"" and ""idiots"" - and that was in public.  Do you see strong ideologies at play here?  Me neither.
  
 -  The takeaway here is that Vermont politics is not so much ideology based as personality based.  People like Bernie and trust him, but outside of the enclaves of the Progressive Party, notably Greater Burlington and a few other cities, the PP doesn't have a lot of traction.

- On Shumlin's failures as Governor (labeled betrayal).  Shumlin did come in promising single payer health care in Vermont.  It was to be the centerpiece of his administration.  Very unfortunately, the launch of the Vermont health care portal - a custom programming job for goodness sake, so that it could be unique to Vermont - was a much bigger disaster than the Federal portal.  It still doesn't work, and the Governor has said if it's not fixed by the end of May, it's going to be scrapped and Vermont will just use the Federal software. (Or maybe not.  There's been some hemming and hawing about this.  Heads have rolled, but not Shumlin's.)

  -   We spent millions and millions on the custom site.  That's enough to piss everybody off, just to start with, and is one big reason that Shumlin came very very close to losing his seat in the last election.

 -    Shumlin had already annoyed the Legislature by refusing to discuss how the single payer plan was to be financed.  Various Democrats (and the exceptionally weak for now) Republicans kept asking, before the election, ""Ummm.  Pete?  How we gonna pay for this?  What will it cost?  We'd kinda like to know, if you don't mind.""  After the election, the Administration came out and said, ""Oops.  Sorry.  Too expensive.""  The blithe statement that the cost could be covered by ""taxing the rich"" is just too disingenuous for words.  Remember there are only 600,000 people in the whole state, and the wealthiest tend to be retirees.  They can (and do) establish winter residencies in income tax free Florida but spend summers here.  There aren't enough 1%'ers here to finance single payer.  It would take a broad based payroll tax, and few people were really eager for that.

- Bernie as mayor of Burlington.  Yes, his supporters were called Sanderistas.  He did spend a lot of time and effort talking about Central America.  A famous quote from a disgruntled member of the city council was, ""El Salvador!  El Salvador!  What about El Burlington?"".  *However* - and it isn't something you read a lot about in the hagiography of Sanders - he was very practical and actually listened to the Old Guard that had run Burlington for decades.  He didn't always agree, of course, but when he wanted to accomplish something practical for the city, he brought them in and they helped.  He did a lot of good for Burlington and is one of the reasons that it still has a thriving downtown despite the Big Box stores on the perimeter.  And if housing is expensive, there is still some working class housing available.  (Although many people complain it's filled with UVM students pushing out the Burlingtonians.  The city keeps hammering on the University to build more on campus housing - it's an annual fight.)  Bernie talked a lot about Central America but he still got things done for Burlington.

- Sanders has ""uncritically supported the Democrats in Vermont"".  Um, yes, but no.  Bernie is not playing on the Vermont stage, he's playing on the DC stage.  It's often a bad idea for DC politicians to interfere in State level politics, particularly outside of the electoral cycle.  A campaign appearance or two, maybe a pancake breakfast fund raiser here or there, sure.  But Bernie directly attacking Shumlin's policies in Vermont would be kind of offensive, even to us Sanders admirers.  ""Mind your own business, Bernie"" would be the tart reply.

- The Great F-35 fight.  This is a local hot potato.  On the one hand, you have a long standing Air National Guard base in Burlington, Vermont (sent to patrol NYC on 911, no less), which provides a lot of good jobs, and gives tiny little Burlington airport really state of the art avionics, runway clearing (helicopters blow light fluffy snow off sometimes - it's fun to watch), and generally make it possible to fly in and out in frequent bad weather.  The F-35s had to be located somewhere, and a mix of upper middle class professions in South Burlington (where the airport is) went all NIMBY on it, aided by the old Left who just generally hate anything military.  After much turmoil, South Burlington voters went with the pro F-35 crowd, as did the entire Vermont Congressional delegation.  The city of Burlington bought out a strip of houses next to the airport just in case the F-35 turns out to be as loud as some shrilly say it is.  I don't know and arguments are ongoing.

The bill that changed post office pension funding requirements was a broadly bipartisan bill with about the same number of republican and democratic sponsors.  It passed the house and the senate with no opposition from either party.  This wasn't a ""Republican"" effort alone.  

&gt;by forcing them to prefund 100% of their pensions and retirement benefits over the next 75 years!  

That is not what happened.  What was required was that the post office catch up its pension funding to the net present value of benefits already earned.  It did not require funding future unearned benefits.  This is about how 1/3 of private corporations fund their pensions, and in my opinion how all pensions should be funded.  

The catch up payments were overly onerous in my opinion.  But that isn't really relevant since the post office hasn't actually made one since 2010. Even if congress had not tinkered with the pension funding the post office has still been bleeding money.  

Of course an entirely different issue is whether the post office needs or should make money, but that's for another day.

Here's what you can do.  Volunteer for a campaign that means something to you. Spread the word, get voters.  

&gt;So, before you berate me with your standards of political action - whatever they are, I ask what can I do? I vote. I voted against the teaparty guy in my state - Purdue - and he still got elected because the drooling, Fox News watching, political talk radio listening morons voted for him.

In a red state?  Well, a lot of the red states are starting to turn blue, due to the younger population.  Go out to college towns and volunteer to get young voters.  



Enough young people got out to vote for a dude named ""Barack Hussein Obama"", and he was able to beat Hillary in the primaries and win the general election, despite huge opposition from the right.  He ended up not being as great as he billed himself, no big surprise, but it did show that if enough young people go out and vote, something can be done.

&gt;Vote? For whom? Billionaires' choice #1 or billionaires' choice #2?

See, I'd have said the same thing as you, but, we're in a thread about Bernie Sanders, a dude who's exactly the OPPOSITE of ""Billionares' choice #1"", who's got a good track record of not taking money from the big banks.  Surely that should give you some encouragement, right?  He's running on the Democrat ticket, too.

Hillary's lost the primary before, she's not unbeatable.

All in all, that's just my suggestion - you seem to be frustrated with both the big money Democrats and the Republicans like a lot of people are.

Why does this matter?  Because if Program A was scheduled to have a 50% increase in funding but the Republicans change it to a 20% increase, that's not a cut.  And even if it was a legitimate *decrease* in funding from last year, does it matter if the long-term spending increase is still going up?

You really need to look up the definitions of Logic terminology before you start using them.

&gt;If this previous statement of mine wasn't clear, I was defining conservatives as individuals who call themselves conservatives. 

...Which is completely wrong. Just because someone calls them self a label doesnt mean they are that label. Just because someone calls themself a social justice warrior, a libertarian, a *whatever*, doesn't mean that they are *that*. And we shouldn't take them that seriously.

That's the beauty of Philosophical political stances.

**But that doesnt matter.** because we're not talking about that. You're putting up an argument to block your failed logic in your previous statements, otherwise known as a [Straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).  In your original statement, you associated Authoritarianism with conservatism. 

&gt;Because stop and frisk wasn't authoritarian and conservative.

I told you that Authoritarianism does not appeal to Conservatism. 

&gt;Yes because conservatives love big government and authoritarianism. Let's just ignore their ""Don't tread on me"" flags.

So, you give authoritarian examples of actions from Republicans. **You** called them Conservatives.

&gt; What president was it again that started the war on drugs which resulted in millions of arrests? Nixon, a conservative. Stop and frisk exploded under Bloomberg.

You say that since they are authoritarian, they are Conservative. Which is **failed logic.** I can't believe I have to repeat myself, but I do.

&gt;I never said that because they were authoritartian (*the correct spelling is ""authoritarian""*) they were conservative, I said that they were conservative because they say they were conservative and they were republicans.

...No, you didn't. **You simply called them conservative.**

Once again, proof 

&gt; What president was it again that started the war on drugs which resulted in millions of arrests? Nixon, a conservative. Stop and frisk exploded under Bloomberg.

Now, onto the next statement:

&gt;In addition, Republicans are nearly universally recognized as the conservative party in the US (in the modern era).

Wikipedia's political articles should not be relied upon for broad views of conservatism/liberalism. Instead, let's go to debate.org, a neutral platform that relies upon popular views. 

http://www.debate.org/opinions/does-republican-equal-conservative

82% say No. The highest rated answer: 

*Conservative is a certain way of thinking, such as a belief in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense. Conservative beliefs on the role of government are that government should be here to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. Conservative policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems by themselves. The Republicans are a political party.*

So, we can firmly establish the fact that Republicans are not Conservatives, and those examples you gave are not great examples of Conservatives, regardless if **you** call them conservative or not. Additionally, authoritarianism and conservatism should **not** be associated with one another.

&gt;Also, authoritarian actions from a democrat in no way proves that conservatives are not authoritarian, this is a false dichotomy.

Once again, you're providing the wrong logical fallacy. My argument had nothing to do with that; I was proving your false association of authoritarianism = conservative. I provided examples of a supposed ""Liberal"" doing authoritarian actions. So, we can conclude that anyone from the  supposed political spectrum can do authoritarian actions, and we shouldn't rely upon the labels of Republican or Democrat for authoritarianism.

First of all, you're pulling the 100,000 figure out of your ass. You have said specifically that it saved 100,000. Now you say ""how can I estimate that""? That's called hyperbole.

Experts in the topic can give civilian estimates all the time. The U.S. nuked Japan specifically because it was estimated an invasion would result in 1 million deaths.

Invading and overthrowing a strongman, while it sounds good in theory, creates a huge power vacuum.

There is an astronomical difference between an elected official, expected to be an expert in the country's foreign policy, and who's privy to secret information, and joe from Arkansas supporting it cause his president said so.

&gt;Democrats in the white house = no invasion of Iraq. It is that simple.

You have NO evidence of this. I say that Hillary demonstrated terrible judgement so you're wrong. But you then contend that she wasn't responsible because she didn't specifically authorize it. I'm sure Jeb Bush or Scott walker  didn't specificaly authorize the Iraq War but supported it. What differentiates them at all?

Bernie could very well mean no war. He voted against Iraq and opposed arming the Syrian Rebels, so he shows the judgement and record neither Hillary not the Republicans have.

As someone else put it: She's different on gay rights, drug policy, incarceration, abortion, women's rights, religion, health care policy, privatization of Social Security, school vouchers, gun rights, taxation of the wealthy, expansion of the military, prioritization of renewable energy, and marijuana legalization. The anti-Hillary hyperbole in this thread is unreal, and that's coming from a Bernie supporter.

You're lying to yourself if you think she cares about any social issue. How can women or LGBT people get equality if they're being killed by drones? Where was Hillary's compassion for the poor when she was a Walmart board member? I don't very closely follow American politics, but how is Hillary 'different' on any of those issues than other Democrats?

&gt;I'm voting for Sanders too, but will be giving all of my support to Hillary if he doesn't win.

It is imperative that we prevent Republicans from taking the White House in 2016 and forming a GOP super-majority because Supreme Court nominations will be up. This may be the most important election in the last 3 decades.

She's not going to make anything particularly worse, like the GOP would, but she's not going to make anything particularly better, like perhaps Bernie would: so, she is a doorway to nothing but the status quo.

512,"Notice how the bill was killed in the State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee?  Wonder why the bill was even being heard in that committee?

Here's why.  Colorado's rules of procedure give the leader of each chamber of the legislature the sole judgement on which committee to choose for a bill.  Since the State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee usually has fewer legitimate bills than any other committee, it's usually used as the ""kill committee"".  The leadership will stack it with the most loyally partisan members they can.  Then when a bill like this comes along, where the leadership wants it killed but no one really wants to be on record voting against it (or, where some individual Republicans might have even voted for it!), they'll route it to military affairs, where the extremists can kill it in committee, and there's no accountability for the rest of the legislature.  No vulnerable Senators from moderate districts have to be on the record as voting against it.

Politics is fun, isn't it?  Yet another reason why, as enlightened as it sounds to say you evaluate candidates based on their personal positions, it's also wrong in the case of the legislature.

551,"This is a wall o' text. There's a tl;dr below.

No, that's not what I'm saying. I don't give a flaming shit what the opposition thinks of a candidate - regardless of whether we're talking about Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders or (for that matter), Walter Mondale or Michael Dukakis. In fact, the way I look at it, the more the right wing hates a candidate, the more likely it is that the candidate will more closely align w/ my perspective. I figure he must be doing something right if those guys are screaming about him.

It used to be an effective tool. These days not so much. They portray anyone w/ a (D) next to his name as the antichrist. 

I'm saying that while Hillary does have big numbers right now, the Republicans have over a billion dollars, 25 years of opposition research, and 25 years of drumming up lunatic ferver over ""scandals"" often made up from whole cloth. Republicans aren't even limited to telling the truth. They've often shown that they are more than willing (hell, happy to) lie through their teeth to secure/maintain power.

Nominating Hillary is playing their game.

Look. I think we have an opportunity here. We have a shot at something. 

When look at the changes going on in our society - changes that happened so quickly - I am stunned. We're talking about changes that I never dreamed I would see in my lifetime.

When I was a young man, Anita Bryant was spokesdouche for a right wing religious organization that fought to oppose gay rights. I mean serious air time for these people to shout about homosexuals. They didn't want homosexuals to be allowed to be teachers.

Look at what happened to marriage equality.

Look at pot.

When I was young, pre-Reagan, I had never heard of a war on drugs. I know now that Nixon started it, but I had never heard of it. There sure was plenty of pot around, though. 

Then came Reagan, the real War on Drugs with it's attendant decimation of civil rights and laws that targeted African-Americans. The nightly news was chock full o' young black men being led out of ill-kept houses in chains on their way to unbelievably long prison sentences for possession or distribution of a substance that people on Wall Street used. If caught the Wall St. types caught a slap on the wrist, of course.

Today it's legal to possess for recreational use in four states (and maybe DC - depends on how that conservative silliness shakes out). 

We are at a moment here. There is no other way to look at it but as a tidal shift in the body politic. The demographics have long predicted it. 

I think we have the opportunity to undo 35 years of GOP buggery of our nation. I think this year we could have our left wing ""Reagan"". Well, left of where we've been for a long time.

And that's not Ms. Clinton. While I have much respect for her and her accomplishments, there's too much smoke around her for there not to be a fire in there somewhere. Remember, I enthusiastically voted for her husband in '92. I think they were badly handled in many ways.

OTOH, a comparison of donors &amp; voting records between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Clinton shows a candidate more closely aligned with the ideals that the Democratic Party once represented. In some ways Ms. Clinton does, but in no way does Mr. Sanders not.

1) What the 12 richest people make is private income, entitlements have to do with government income. 

2) America already is running massive deficits to cover the expenses, but to be honest I don't know exactly which program is running a deficit, but e.g. the [social security trust funds](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/oact/progdata/fundFAQ.html#a0=7) will be depleted within the next 20 years in two out of three possible scenarios, in the third the trusts will remain solvent over the next 75 years. With not only healthcare costs rising, I doubt the likelihood of the last mentioned scenario. The current system is not sustainble, both in europe and America.

I don't necessarily agree with the 'haunting' meme used by the article, so no, I don't 'eat that shit up.'  None of the vitriol or accusations of 'ideological hate' that you're talking about here apply to me at all.

So, maybe cool it a bit, eh?

&gt; And advocates for each agency are going to scream foul when they're given less of an increase than requested or gasp made to lower spending! 

Well, a big part of this is due to increased population.  If your population goes up, the funding has to go up just to offer the same services you did before, let alone expand them.  I know the concept of 'expanding services' is anathema to many conservatives, but the rest of the population sees problems that need solving and nobody else doing the solving and demands a solution; that's government.  Just telling people to fuck off and solve their own problems isn't effective in the long run.

&gt; Trying to say that $275 million over 2 years is going to ""haunt"" Walker due to slightly lowered economic growth projections both statewide and nationally is fucking ridiculous. It's like saying someone making $50k/year is going to be haunted by an increased gas price that costs them an additional fifty cents per day than they thought they would pay.

There are two points here worth discussing: one, the fact that Walker, like many other non-economist Republicans, seems to have lied when he said that cutting taxes on businesses and the wealthy would lead not only to an explosion of jobs, but **more revenues** than would have been raised if the taxes had remained where they were at.  Both of these points have failed to materialize.  From the article:

&gt; Walker, an all but certain presidential candidate, and legislative Republicans have said for months that a revved up economy, fueled in part by their tax cuts, would lead to more tax money than projected through June 2017 and help them mitigate the education cuts. 

Totally wrong.  These guys are just, totally wrong about how these things work.  [The truth is that no serious economist ever believes that revenues after a tax cut will surpass what would have been gained without said cuts.](http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/10/ponnuru-tax-cut.html)  Anyone who claims they will is stunningly ignorant on the subject.  I understand that Walker and the GOP have a vision for Wisconsin and they keep getting elected, so fine; but why lie to the population of the state?  If you're going to cut taxes, don't pretend it won't lead to further cuts in spending, if you want a balanced budget.  It absolutely will.

What's 'haunting' Walker here is that his and the legislature's lies are being revealed.  They sold the tax cuts on the idea that they would be balanced out with additional revenue from the cuts themselves.  That was a lie and they either knew it when they said it, or they are idiots who know nothing about economics.  I would respect the Wisc. GOP a lot more if they were simply honest and up-front about what they want to do, instead of constantly hiding what they want to do by saying one thing during election time, and turning right around and doing something else when in office.

Second, your example about a 50 cent increase in gas prices per day 'haunting' someone making $50k/year is actually a bad example.  We're talking about $180 in increased costs over the year, which yeah, isn't much when compared to $50k.  But!  We're not actually comparing it to the whole $50k, we're comparing it to the amount of discretionary spending that's available to that person.  Increased gas costs can't be balanced out by cutting your rent, cutting your insurance payments, cutting your car payment, or a whole host of other activities which are akin to 'mandatory' spending for an individual.  Not without incurring a LOT of pain and likely additional hassle or costs elsewhere.

It's far more accurate to compare that $180 to about $5k, which is the likely discretionary budget for that person.  That's about 3% of the budget, which isn't much, but when you're already in debt and deficit, it's very Not Helpful.

&gt;She was against the Obama style plan originally (in 03) but now she wants to go even further. 

That's not actually accurate.  Her position has always been roughly what Obama's position is; basically, give legal status and a path to citizenship to people who are already here, while also enforcing the border to stop more illegal immigrants from coming in.  That's the ""grand bargin"" Obama's been trying to get his entire administration, and that's the same thing she supported.

So, no, her position really hasn't changed.  Yes, she was in favor of a ""border wall"", and she was also in favor of a path to citizenship.  That's not a contradiction, it's basically the same compromise that Democrats in general have been pushing for for the last decade now.

Now, personally, I think the whole ""border wall"" idea is stupid and pointless, a total waste of money and effort.   But that's really a different issue; the positions she's taken here are consistent and pretty common among progressives in politics.

They get sent back home because they are here illegally, not because they violated traffic laws.

First of all, my examples of failed ""supposed to's"" were just that. There's no assumed timeline or expectation of beyond explicit promises of X causing/leading to Y. Second, not all of those are caused by taxation or the government, when corporate &amp; top tier income taxes are at all time lows. Third, for some of those things, no amount of time is acceptable for them to persist or exist...if I want to avoid a ticket, excessive fuel cost or a larger carbon footprint on my conscience, I stop speeding now, not in 5, 10, 20 years later.  


&gt;Part of the problem for states is that the Federal government sucks so many tax dollars out of the states, they tax policies of the states may not have an enormous impact.

This, I agree with, but likely for different reasons. The preeminent reason why federal spending overwrites/offsets more conservative state spending policies is because of red states and ""red state interests"". Period. Stop the wars and all corporate subsidies, and that issue fixes itself. (I'd even suggest stopping welfare for the states who have a majority of voters with an ideological opposition to it, but then there'd be homeless Republicans everywhere.)


&gt;You message seems to imply that lower taxes have never worked. That's just not the case though. 

Then you would be putting words in my mouth. Lower taxes can work, depending on things like the pre-existing state of the economy, relative success of our education system (although, that's more sociological than political) and measurable level of benevolence/ethics exhibited by the private sector. Exactly none of those things are where they should be in order for lower taxes to work *right now*.

I don't even think the Republicans are saying that. What they're saying is that she was incompetent and out-of-touch with what was going on on the ground. 

The Benghazi thing to me isn't about Benghazi. It's about the email. It's kind of like how Nixon didn't get in trouble for Watergate, he got in trouble for trying to *cover up* Watergate.

When a leader proves that they're willing to break the law to hide things [even minor things] they have to go.

Hillary--like Nixon--broke the law. Nixon erased tapes. Hillary erased emails.

That, to me, is the entire substance of the case. The corruption. The feeling like a leader is above-the-law.

Once Hillary erased those documents, she established a pattern of Nixonian creepiness. It's the same pattern that was started back when Clinton appointee Sandy Berger was stuffing embarrassing documents in his underwear after 9/11. Remember that one?

He was removing documents that were embarrassing to the Clintons from the national archives--and he got caught doing it.

The Clintons have been doing this crap a long, long time.

Hillary's recent email erasures aren't a new thing. It's a pattern.

She needs to go.

Just like your other point about the Clinton Foundation scandal regarding the conflict of interest of getting millions of dollars from the very dictators whose countries she was touring as Secretary of State. It looks like classic quid-pro-quo. You do ""certain favors"" for us, and we give you a ""charitable donation"". That's classic money-laundering. You said whether it's illegal or not, ""It's a question of character.""

Exactly.

You keep making my points for me.

Whenever Hillary gets busted, there's always a ready excuse. If she does unethical things, but they're not illegal, the pre-packaged meme is, ""Hey, it wasn't technically illegal!"" And then when she *does* do things that were technically illegal [like bypassing the State Department servers, and then erasing the emails--both technically illegal], the excuse is, ""Okay, okay, she broke the law. But hey! That's not such a big deal, right?""

There's always an excuse for the Clintons.

Aren't you tired of making excuses for this corrupt dynasty?

It's the reason why I, as a Republican, want Jeb Bush gone. My principles won't allow me to keep making excuses for these mob families who think it's their right to keep running the government.

Please, please, please--if you have a shred of character or principle left--throw your support behind someone who isn't a compromised, corporatist, NAFTA-peddling con artist. There are so many people on the Left with character [like Bernie Sanders]. But you'll ignore someone who actually represents your interests, because the media wants you to support one of the two Goldman Sachs candidates: a Clinton or a Bush.

This nonsense has to change. We have to stop being so easily played. ""Er . . . uh . . . all those ethical violations and illegal acts are . . . er . . . conspiracy theories purely cooked up by the other side."" No! No, they're not. Really, they're not!

They'll always rig the system to put one of their Wall Street-approved thugs in [and keep the Bernie Sanders' out] by staging that political theater.

Don't you remember how Bill Clinton invented the ""new Democrat""? The so-called ""Reagan Democrats"" who were against welfare, etc? Don't you remember Clinton cutting welfare? Don't you remember the Defense of Marriage Act happening under Clinton, too? Or how about NAFTA?

Clinton was the first Wall Street Democrat. Up until Clinton, the party relied on the unions for support while the Republicans were typically Wall Street's hirelings. Then Clinton changed all that by pivoting right. In his cynical calculation, he'd keep all the Democrats (who would vote for him by sheer rote) and pick up the independents in the middle by adopting Republican-like policies.

Clinton knew that, by doing this, he could also pick up Wall Street donations.

That's how the most devastating economic agreement in US history [NAFTA] got passed. Clinton did the corporations' bidding.

So we're in a situation where we have Goldman Sachs candidate 1 and Goldman Sachs candidate 2.

635,"How is this really capitalism though? Yes, the businesses are ""private"", but their only client is the government. That sounds more like the technical definition of facism to me, not capitalism. The reason all of these businesses buy out government is because the government essentially has the power to decide which businesses survive and which die. They buy government and then use government to make their businesses thrive. That isn't capitalism. Capitalism is when businesses have to compete in the market in order to thrive, it isn't a system in which the government makes that decision. When government is making the decision of who succeeds it then becomes vital to businesses that want to succeed to buy government. It is the excessive power of the state that gives incentives to the corruption of the state.

You give government the power to decide markets, who is going to want that power, and what will they be willing to do to get it?

Republicans focus on the corrupting effect government has on the private sector, democrats focus on the corrupting effect the private sector has on government.

637,"&gt;Well, Republicans have been quick to pat themselves on the back for passing the first balanced budget since 2001. Even John Boehner took to Twitter to brag about the momentous occasion: 

&gt;Between 2001-2009, George W. Bush added $5.9 trillion to our national debt. So, if Republicans passed a balanced budget in 2001, as many of them are bragging about now, why exactly did we more than double our national debt following the passing of that budget? Not to mention, Bush inherited a balanced budget to begin with. 

&gt;Basically what Republicans like Boehner are doing is bragging about the fact that they passed a balanced budget proposal  by referencing a 2001 budget that was the catalyst for a 101 percent increase in our national debt.

For everyone like you who is against taxation and claiming that it is tantamount to theft, I would remind you that there was once an era in American politics known as the progressive era. Both Democrats and Republicans had progressive wings and taxation was markedly higher starting around WWII. The American people believed that society needed each other to succeed in the war effort and in pulling the country out of the Great Depression.  The era proceeding the progressive era was known as the gilded age...and income inequality paralleled the inequality of today.  Don't be fooled though: not everyone shares your convictions or ideals.

657,"The GOP is simply a far better political party than the Democrats.  To be clear on what I mean, here's a definition:

&gt;A political party is an organization of people which seeks to achieve goals common to its members through the acquisition and exercise of political power.

The GOP is among the best in the world at the game of politics, the Democrats average at best.  They use every tactic available, gain every little advantage.  They are better at fundraising, better at focusing their base, better at pushing as a unified front.  

But what they are really good, better perhaps than any political movement in modern history, is pushing fear.  They've learned that fear is the secret to a unified political base, a way of forcing social conservatives to hold hands with financial conservatives that come from entirely different backgrounds.

Examples?  /r/conservative.  Breaking down their top posts (note, this is general.  I'm mainly noting the fact that they AREN'T talking policy issues, but rather pushing tension):

* Fear of blacks
* Fear of blacks
* Fear of Mexicans
* Fear of blacks and Mexicans
* Fear of big government
* Fear of Mexicans
* Nothing
* Fear of Mexicans
* Fear of liberal media
* &amp;c., with some fear of Muslims thrown in

Almost every post is designed to create tension towards an out-group.  You'll see very similar things at /r/republican, or even non-US conservative subreddits like /r/tory, albeit with different out-groups.  

The constant usage of fear acts as a massive directing force for the Republican party, and the same tactics have been used for massive conservative shifts in almost all the English speaking countries (Canada, the UK, and Australia have all shifted heavily towards the right).  

Fear is so useful to a political party because it lowers critical thinking and dissension. Republicans aren't less intelligent than Democrats, but they have to deal with far more fear-pushing bullshit.  How can a person vote in their own best interest if they have fear clouding their judgement?  

Liberal groups try to use fear in similar ways, but they fail because their out-groups are more abstract.  Because their base is more varied, they don't have convenient scapegoats like conservative groups have.  Compare ""the rich"" versus ""Muslims.""  Which is easier to picture?  Which is easier to to use as a boogeyman?  

The great thing about the Republican tactics is that they feed into themselves.  They push conspiracies to create fear, and that fear lowers critical thinking and makes it easier to push other conspiracies.  This is why they make everything into a conspiracy.  Climate change isn't just wrong, it is a global liberal conspiracy.  Hillary and Obama aren't just bad politicians, they are involved with scores of conspiracies.  

TL;DR:  Most of your rant comes down to the fact that a political party's goal is not to improve the country, but to win elections.  The Republicans are far better at winning elections, motivating their base with fear while the Democrats struggle with voter apathy because they can't use the same tactic nearly as well.

They were Democratic policies too. I know that's easy to forget.

&gt;How are we so mad at Obama

Now I need to vent. Obama had a super majority in Congress when he first came into office, and rather than using his majority to pass a higher minimum wage, reform banking in a meaningful way, raise taxes on the 1% or pursue green energy policy he decided to pass his legacy and force the ACA through a Democratic Congress. A law that gives huge handouts to the country's wealthiest corporations. He also raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than any other president and has deported more immigrants.

That's not all. Obama expanded America's foreign policy, drone use and military spending, while doubling down on the domestic spying he promised to eliminate. He also pushes secret trade deals that will continue to benefit the top 1% at the expense of everyone else.

Despite all of this, people continue to support him because he talks a big game. He says the things we all want to hear knowing he can't follow through on it, or purposefully does the opposite.

Yes.  It's NOT that different.  When we lost 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2009 while we had to also pay for Bush's wrong war, that was a major disruption. 

Things were not ""bad"" in the 1950s or the 1960s. In fact they were pretty good under Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson, especially compared to Junior.    And if you look at the whole history from Kennedy to Carter (that's 5 presidents: Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter) we created 7 million manufacturing jobs.   While Bush lost 6 million in just 8 years all by himself.

I want a successful country.  Not a failure.  And that takes creating jobs - not destroying them. And whether spending is 30% or 33% or 38% just doesn't make up for losing jobs.  Aside from that, spending went up during Bush so its hard to see Republicans having some upper hand on spending, and the debt tripled from Bush and unbudgeted Iraq spending that we, the middle class have to pay off. We're left holding the bag and the people who caused this, the Romney's the Adelsons, the Mercer Reynolds, should not get off the hook without paying for what they decided to spend on.

Oh, wait, you didn't.  After my initial comment was that enforcement mechanisms in a complex society are too messy to be distilled down to the minarchist libertarian idea of ""one right: property"", you then say socioeconomic systems are ""ridiculously complex"", so how do you think that your ""liberty"" concept would spread?  I have given you examples of why it would never be implemented because it is SO FAR from what any nation in the world has actually gravitated towards, and you haven't given a single example of WHY people would gravitate toward your system.

Again, why would people embrace a concept of ""individual liberty"" that results in the complete destruction of ACTUAL (i.e. experiential or phenomenological) liberty for the majority of the world population?  When push comes to shove, I and nearly every other person will trade abstract liberty for free time to pursue our interests (i.e. actual liberty), health care and freedom from disease (i.e. actual liberty), autonomy in the workplace and some degree of control over our wages and working conditions (i.e. actual liberty), control over the political system (i.e. actual liberty).  See, your idea of liberty is meaningless to those who have no capital assets and have no power or leverage in society.  Not to mention the incompatibility between liberty and the exclusive ownership of land property (you didn't build property and even Nozick (!) made fun of the absurdity of the ""mixing labor with land"" argument, not to mention Proudhon's takedown long before).

No offense (wait, no, offense intended), but if promoting individual liberty does not lead to the greater good, then it means more individuals are losing liberty in order for a smaller number to gain liberty. 

Given your choice, I go with Socialism 101 times out of 100, because the only thing that matters is the greatest good for the greatest number.

This is not the case. Even the link you presented supports my side. If you can find a reputable source which claims the Democrats benefit more from gerrymandering I will concede.

&gt;If the Democrats are in power, it helps the Democrats.

You don't seem to understand how gerrymandering works. Only the party in power when the districts are redrawn benefits from gerrymandering. For the next decade or so that power balance remains even if the party who was previously in power is replaced. For example: Lets say the Democrats are in power during a redistricting year. They gerrymander our districts in their favor and the following year, they get completely voted out of office and the Republicans have a majority. The gerrymandered districts will still benefit the Democrats until the next redrawing of the districts. In our current situation, the Republicans benefit more than the Democrats. The Democrats benefit in certain situations, but the Republicans simply have more districts gerrymandered in their favor and they will continue to have this advantage until the 2020 elections when the districts will be redrawn.

Truthfully, NASA has had quite a large amount of mission creep. AFAIK, it wasn't created to be a gigantic earth science research department. Republicans aren't happy about NASA's conclusions that are inconvenient to the Republican narrative, so they want to take NASA back to its roots: aeronautics and space. 

But the thing is, that mission creep came quite naturally, and it's actually a very good thing. NASA are experts at building and launching satellites. It so happens that their expertise in the space realm has translated directly into revolutionary earth science. The agency that should be studying earth science most, NOAA, is not a space administration, and it does not have space and satellite expertise. Thus, while NOAA does excellent work, our understanding of the planet would be substantially less without NASA's space-based instruments. 

On top of that, NASA does planetary science. We don't understand other planets, so we have to use Earthly analogs to understand extraterrestrial planetary bodies. This gives NASA a direct reason to study the earth--specifically, study the earth *from space-based observations.* Why? Because the more we can understand our planet from afar, the more we can understand other planets from afar. 

**tl;dr** NASA is the National *Aeronautics and Space* Administration, and part of its mission is to study extraterrestrial planetary bodies.

The house is insulated by districting, but the senate isn't. Since they pay the price when the house shits the bed, the president has leverage over the house via the senate. Look at the well-documented conflict between the house and senate the during the shutdown; the Republicans in the senate were desperate to make a deal with Obama once the GOP starting getting the blame. If the Republicans in the house want to dig their heels in against a popular presidential agenda, it'll be at the expense of their own party's future. In the meanwhile, Democrats can still do a lot with control with 2 &amp; 1/2 branches of the federal government. 

In the long run, a liberal supreme court will start chipping away at bad districting sooner or later, eroding the GOP's advantage in the house. There's a strong chance that begins in Hillary's first term.

WASHINGTON--Tax receipts surged in April to generate the largest monthly U.S. budget surplus in seven years, a sign that deficits could decline more than analysts had expected just a few months ago amid a continuing economic expansion.

The U.S. Treasury collected $472 billion in revenues last month, a record, which led to a $157 billion surplus for the month. While the U.S. tends to run a surplus in April due to tax filing season, the surplus was $50 billion more than last year and the fifth largest monthly surplus on record.

The figures are the latest indication that rising stock values, corporate profits, and incomes for the wealthiest Americans are curbing the growth of U.S. budget deficits that soared in the years following the financial crisis.

Revenues for the fiscal year through April are running 9% ahead of the year earlier, while government spending is running 6% ahead of last year. The fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2014.

For the 12-month period ended in April, the U.S. ran a deficit of $460 billion, the second-lowest annual figure since September 2008. The deficit over the last 12 months is down from the year-earlier figure of $499 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated just two months ago that the deficit would stand at $486 billion in the current fiscal year.

Congress and the White House agreed to a series of spending curbs four years ago that sharply reined in government spending, known as the sequestration. While government spending has advanced over the past year, April showed that revenues are now running ahead of spending, holding down deficits.

Republican control of Congress means that big battles still loom over how much money the government should collect and how it should be spent. President Barack Obama has called for an increase in spending above levels set out by the sequester.

House and Senate Republicans passed a joint budget resolution earlier this month that would boost military spending while holding domestic spending essentially flat. That measure doesn't go to the White House and instead will be used to set overall spending levels for appropriations bills that will go to the president later this year.

Mr. Obama has said he won't accept bills that keep spending at the levels mandated by the sequester nor those that boost military spending without parallel increases in nondefense spending.

Meanwhile, Congress has yet to raise the federal debt limit. The Treasury has been using emergency measures since mid-March to avoid breaching the ceiling. While the Treasury hasn't yet said how long it might be able to do that, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that those emergency measures should last until October or November.

1002,"&gt;We have a majority of registered democrats in this state and yet the Republican Party holds every single state elected office as well as majorities in both state houses. If gerrymandering benefited both parties, one would expect to see a distribution of elected officials form both.

While the state house outcomes may reflect partisan gerrymandering in favor of Republicans, the fact that they hold all statewide elected offices suggests that there is something else at play here: statewide office elections are not affected by the sort of redistricting that gerrymandering implies.

The data you've given implies other causation for the differing voter registration vs. election outcomes. Perhaps Republicans are better at turning registered Democratic voters. Perhaps independents in the state lean Republican. Or perhaps neither of those things is true in the long term, and the current distribution is due to more specific issues in the last election (I'm not Floridian; I don't know). A handful of weak candidates from the Democratic side in races could hugely affect the outcomes.

Having said that, the statehouse representation does potentially suggest some redistricting favoring Republicans in the state.

&gt;Can you explain why this is? In fact, can you provide an example of a single state where gerrymandering is an acknowledged issue that doesn't have a majority of Republicans in charge??

The explanation is that while gerrymandering itself is politically neutral, it may have been practiced more - or more severely - by one party than the other in a particular state.

As for examples of Democratic gerrymandering, Maryland is the most gerrymandered state in the nation - along with North Carolina - and its districts were redrawn by Democrats in 2012.

It's amazing how lowering the tax rates on the wealthiest citizens often correllates to some sort of economic decline, overall. During Eisenhower America, that time the Republicans seem obsessed with bringing us back to, the wealthiest citizens paid around 90% in taxes. Nixon dropped this to 70% before Regan lowered it even further (to roughly 30%). Clinton came in and raised it up to approximately 36% and our economy rebounded. Then Bush came in and gave his famous Bush-era tax breaks and I don't have to tell you how the economy looked when he left office.

Obama came along and brought taxes back up to where they were during the Clinton administration and we've seen steady job growth over the last year (at least).

It's important to remember the correllation does not mean causation, exactly, but it's interesting to look at almost 100 years of tax codes and compare them to the economies of their time.

1009,"Can we clarify what you mean by ""gridding""? Because what I envision when you say that is a grid where every congressional district in the US is a square of the same size, regardless of population density and, to me, the strongest argument against that is that it would give *massively* disproportionate representation - for instance, Alaska would have one vote in the House for approximately every 10k residents, while California would have one vote for every 2 *million* residents - Alaskan US citizens would have, on average, ~200x the legislative representation in their federal government that Californian US citizens had, and that's not even accounting for bits of the grid in sparsely populated parts of the state where you'd potentially have a House rep representing the interests of less than 1000 people.

*If*, on the other hand, what you mean by ""gridding"" is the shortest-splitline algorithm, then we should be having an entirely different conversation.

&gt;gerrymandering is very useful to solidify a base especially if the base is ensconced in a bastion of opposition.

The problem is that, by and large, this is *not* how it's being used - instead, it's being used to take, for example, 5 districts that are all relatively competitive, say 50/50 for ease of example usage, and redividing them such that you have *one* district which is 90/10 in favor of Democrats, and *four* districts which are 60/40 in favor of Republicans. This is being done with *zero* regard for giving minority groups/opinions a voice.

&gt; from my perspective they want to end it before it can get gerrymandered back on what I'm assuming they fear to be a 2016 fully republican congress.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""fully Republican"" but, since Democrats historically have exceptionally low turnout in off-year elections (Republicans have lower turnout in off-years as well, but the difference isn't as extreme), *all* House seats are up for election every 2 years, and all the districts will be the same as they were in 2014, statistically speaking, the Democrats will likely pick up seats in the House in 2016. That's not to say they'll gain a majority, just that they are very unlikely to have a net *loss* of House seats in the 2016 elections, because it's the same seats and districts as 2014, just with better Democratic turnout relative to Republican turnout than in 2014, if history is any guide, at least. Likewise, in the 2016 Senate race, the Republicans are likely to lose seats because, of the 17 seats considered to have competitive races, 14 are Republican, while only 3 are Democratic, so the Republicans have a lot more to lose and the Democrats have a lot more to gain - for comparison, in the 2014 election, Republicans held only 3 of the 11 seats considered to be competitive, so they had less to lose and more to gain, which is exactly what wound up happening.",1,-0.0517063492063,0.157322141453,0.511879324379,0.268996653706,0.510416666667,0.75,496,0.0921985815603,49.6,0.0498511904762,0.58685515873

* America knew the Nazi's were rounding up Jews and taking them to death camps but refused to bomb the railway tracks as was being requested by Jewish Americans, even though they were bombing around those areas all the time.  The sad truth is that Americans also didn't like the Jews back then.

The meaning of the word ""socialist"" is still dynamic.  It is interpreted as anywhere from full-blown communist to a reluctant admission that a social program is the only thing that currently works to solve a problem, but otherwise, everything should be capitalist.

Look at Eisenhower in the 1950s, for example: ""Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism.[117] He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years, [which had not been completed under Truman.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower)

Today we only talk about smaller government, privatizing Social Security (Even Obama pushed 'chained CPI', which would have reduced Social Security payments over the years), and cutting benefits.

A ""socialist"" during the Eisenhower administration would have been a communist.

* $2.4 Billion taken from SS trust fund and replaced with IOU.

* His PNAC groups along with Allen Greenspan were the ones who championed the policies that allowed for the Derivatives market, the end of Glass-Stegal, and the lowering of the reserve requirement for banks (allowing them to get more and more into hock and over leverage). The estimate is $1.4 Quadrillion in Credit Default Swaps. Though I'm sure this is not something the people on the street are aware of.

* He and other Republicans partially privatized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- a point they don't bring up when blaming these government programs for failing.

* Alienated other countries.

* Prevented and defunded numerous high tech research, not only in stem cells but in Green Tech, did not support home-grown companies and the would be advantage was shipped off to China.

* Promoted tax breaks (like his father) for companies offshoring or outsourcing labor.

* Made oil companies immune to lawsuits based on the chemical composition of their products.

* Put Blackwater and Cronies in charge of Katrina cleanup. They outsourced the labor in New Orleans to Mexicans and in many cases refused to pay them while charging the taxpayer handsomely. Massive unemployment of locals ensued.

* Failed to come to the aid of Katrina victims (and I know Conservatives have their own myths surrounding what should and shouldn't happen, but he basically extorted the governor to hand over the national guard, and intentional stalled all efforts at help, they also wouldn't let Cuban doctors in, closed schools while not able to find the state with supply trucks for three months -- the list is extensive).

The Bush presidency was an artful study in; how to fuck up a country. And people like you think a government can't effect an economy?

They had no money and exports were only 5% of the US economy at that time. People repeat this crap but don't actually look into these factoids.

It seems like every time the Democrats won, they moved a little to the left, and every time they lost, they moved to the right, while the Republicans just moved farther and farther to the right every cycle.

At least this time, in 2014, they didn't do that.  They lost, and if anything, that made them stand up and move farther to the left, to actually start to show some real spine.

&gt; The facts just don't add up 


Ok, I don't know if you're posting this because you truly don't understand what's going on or to be a contrarian, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it's the former.

There are two types of ice in the Antarctic. Land ice and Sea ice. Land ice is ice that exists on the continent of Antarctica itself, and Sea ice is ice that exists in the sea itself. Whenever you see Republicans tripping all over themselves to ""disprove"" global warming by saying ""SEE? THE ICE IN ANTARCTICA IS GROWING!"", they have fundamentally left out something very important: They're only talking about Sea Ice, not Land Ice. 

Why is this an important distinction? Well, because the Land Ice is far more massive than the Sea Ice, and is melting at a rate several thousand times higher than the Sea Ice is growing. 

And why, exactly, is the Sea Ice growing? Well, first there's the obvious reason: Gigantic chunks of land ice keep breaking off of the continent and fall into the sea.

Then there's the not-so-obvious reasons. For one, salt water has a much lower freezing temperature than fresh water. The Antarctic sea is saltwater, but with the massive influx of freshly melted ice flowing into the sea, that lowers the salinity and greatly increases the freezing temperature of the water. Thus the melting Land Ice makes it far easier for the sea to freeze, and thus grow Sea Ice. 

Third; freshwater is also less dense than saltwater, and thus it tends to stay on top of the saltwater, and from point #2 we know that freshwater freezes at a much higher temperature.

All of this combines to cause more sea ice to form. Caused entirely by the land ice melting. Caused entirely by Global Warming.

Look, it's not rocket science, but it is science nonetheless. Please keep that in mind before trying to make ""points"" like this in the future.",6,0.191494252874,0.154119035386,0.477586206897,0.339018083859,0.5,1.0,354,0.0514285714286,16.0909090909,0.0,0.0

You might want to consider the fact that children take social queues from both parents and that the absence of a father-figure is negative to a child's development. A woman cannot teach a boy how to be a man. If a boy grows up with no male role model, he doesn't know how to behave or learn any skills that will lead to a lot of confusion and frustration. Single-mother raised males are often more violent because they don't know how to behave to improve their circumstances in a positive manner because no man ever taught them.

I'm not really going to get into how many people are affected or the issue of getting one for poor / minority people. Rather, I'm just going to state that there is no need for the ID requirement in the first place. Republicans say it is to prevent voter fraud, but what fraud? No studies, no statistics show ""rampant voter fraud"" and no Republican can ever prove this allegedly ""massive amount of fraud"" because it doesn't exist.

These things have to be considered based on cost vs benefits. In this case, voter ID really only prevents a subset of people from voting, or making it difficult for them, while solving virtually no fraud. Not to mention most actual fraud is not related to in-person voting, which is what the ID requirement addresses.

Lastly, why should a bunch of people have to deal with more restrictions that are completely unnecessary, when the effort is blatantly partisan. It's not just like these Voter ID laws create ID requirements. A lot of them also cut back on early voting, election-day registration, polling locations &amp; hours, and so on. All these cut services tend to benefit Democrats at least slightly more than Republicans.

Their motive here is not genuine and the actual voter fraud statistics are so, so much lower than they would have you believe. So why should anyone have to deal with more restrictions when they are unnecessary?

1206,"1. The Republicans had always been ahead of the Democrats in civil rights aspects, what happened in the incident you are referring to is Barry Goldwater decided to declare the opposite of the Republican party beliefs in a desperate attempt to gain the support  of southern racists. Obviously, this turned out to be a stupid move because not only did he still lose the election, he basically drove all black Americans from the party. Even worse, the Democrat party saw this as an excellent opportunity to use this even to gain the upper hand in succeeding elections. It's politics, you find out how to exploit your opponent and you do so, is it shit? Yes. Did the republican party then forever partake in Barry's ""strategy?"" No.

2. The republicans and democrats didn't ""switch sides"", the Republican party did not just make its stance ""okay we are racist now."" No, they retracked. What happened was a hiccup, it was not a ""switch sides."" I mean, seriously, there was a KKK affiliated senator aligned with the Democrats who just died in 2010, while in office!

3. Yes, southern racists did move to the Republican party. But how much? Well, let's look at some data from the general social survey. Up until 2008, the White Republicans were more okay with electing a black president than the white Democrats. [Source (a graph of the compiled data from the general social survey)](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-8.png?w=1024). White Republicans and White Democrats still hold extremely similar views on other races regarding intelligence. [Source](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-4.png?w=1024). What about the belief on black Americans and laziness? Nope, still close [Source](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-3.png?w=1024). What the actual truth here is, the amount of racists in each party are very similar. The republicans got the edge from that Goldwater stunt, but no where near a night and day difference, and nowhere near a ""switched sides"" worthy label. I know it may be unpopular here to believe this, but dislike of Obama does not equate to racism. Also, do note this data only counts White members of each party, as far as I know, there isn't much data to showcase the racial attitudes of each race in the US. 

5. Nowadays, what gets depicted as racism in politics, is really just the different ideas on how poverty should be handled. Republicans believe that aiding the poorer citizens is not good motivation for leaving poverty, Democrats feel differently. Here's another graph that depicts that similar notion! [Source](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/silver-racial-index-6.png?w=1024)

5. While it may be a long time before the Republicans get black Americans with them again, it already is happening. But for the love of God, the Republican party and Democrat party did not switch, this is used as a narrative all the time in politics in an attempt to deny all the negative history the Democrat party has with civil rights and instead, shove it all off on the Republican party)

Yes, I literally posted statistics that show this, but it is nowhere near the level that it is made out to be, it is actually a very minor percentage, and among young republicans and young democrats, there is seemingly no difference at all.

The quote you're giving is hard to understand.

Bottom line, though, is that the gap in '12 is 8 points while the gap in '04 and '06 was only 4 points and thus within the margin of error.

&gt;The difference between California and the 8 states I listed is that California is not a swing state. It is fairly consistently split 60/40.

That's true. I added Maryland in an edit a few minutes after posting my comment, but it seems it was too late for you to notice. MD is also more partisan than any of the states you listed, but that election wasn't much more one-sided than Indiana, which appeared on your list.

Actually, wait -- where did your data for Indiana come from? Because I just looked up their last election, and Ds got 37% of the vote, not 46%, winning the same number of seats (22%). So that's quite comparable to the California results the same year. It looks like you're using 2012 results, not 2014 results. Which is fine, I suppose, but one election isn't sufficient to call a state one of the ""worst gerrymandered"".

&gt;In 4 of those states the Dems actually won

While that's true -- they didn't win by as much. I see a consistent slight increase in the D proportion of the votes versus the data I have. PA 50% instead of 51%, WI 50% instead of 51%, and MI 51% not 53%.

Yeah, I do agree. I mainly find that trend interesting because the reasons for it seem to carry some weight. Small / medium grievances build up over 6-8 years and the president in power get casted onto that president's party, and you can see this in the 2nd term losses that the president's party takes. I think only during Clinton's 2nd term did a party not lose seats during a president's 2nd term, and that may be because he held a high approval rating and the Republicans focused too much on the Lewinsky scandal that no one cared much about.

Or in short: A president probably has to be popular (60%+ or more approval) for his party to do well in elections from his mid-2nd term and next presidential election. Hard to maintain a high approval rating in a country divided ideologically, and especially with an opposition-controlled Congress.

Your adding of an extra 3 hours to the day aside, I thought the answer was obvious at the time, and still do. 

Hillary was someone they'd been running against since the mid 1990s.  They had a game plan.  They had dirt.  She had a long record in public life and they figured that it could be turned against her.  The black dude?  Shit.  They had no game plan if he got into the race.  


So they lined up behind Hillary.  They wanted her to win the nomination so that they could tear her down.  If she actually won the nomination (and let's be honest, any Democrat running in 2008 was pretty much a lock for the White House) they could spend the next four or eight years making money off her.


The entire right wing media apparatus - from Rush Limbaugh to Fox News - was built during the Bill Clinton years.  If they couldn't hold onto the Presidency (and they couldn't), then they damned well sure could make a lot of money off the result of a Hillary Clinton administration.

Do you think a business should be allowed to forbid black people in their shop? Do you think a catering company should be allowed to refuse servicing an interracial marriage?

What you're getting at is the struggle between equality under the law vs. freedom of contract. But we already have federal laws in place that mandate businesses with a certain number of employees must comply with non-discrimination policies. I don't see you or Republicans raging about federal laws mandating that most companies not be allowed refuse service based on race.

For example, Title VII prohibits any business from discriminating on the basis of race if your company has 15 or more employees. Other federal laws like the ADA, ADEA, the EPA, and GINA also have these threshold requirements because no one (who should be taken seriously) is advocating that literally all small businesses should be forced to contract with anyone who walks through their door.

If you're a baker or a florist or a photograper it's unlikely that any proposed federal anti-discrimination statute would apply to you. But if you have a big enough company and you hold yourself out the public under the protection and advantages of state and federal laws, it's reasonable to apply federal and state anti-discrimination practices to your business.

I think it's disgusting, no matter how big or small your business, to refuse service to someone because they're black, or a woman, or disabled. I think it's just as disgusting if a business refuses service for a gay couple/person. If a small business decides to do any of those things, they'll have to bear the shame of it AND the likelihood that their business will be boycotted (like the one in Indiana).

Why are you assuming that the TPP is for the ""greater good""?  It could just as easily be a net loss for the people of the countries involved.

Yes, it will be difficult to pass a massive omnibus treaty like the TPP if we allow full democratic input from all member countries.  Why is that a bad thing?

Circumstances... but no probably not.

&gt;What you're getting at is the struggle between equality under the law vs. freedom of contract.

No not really. This has little to do with equality under the law. Heck, even a ban on gay marriage can be argued as equality under the law, since it applies equally to all.

There's a lot more nuance to it than that. Simply put: if I felt that allowing caterers and photographers to refuse gay wedding business would effectively force homosexuals into a second class where they would be unable to enjoy the same basic life experiences as a heterosexual, then I would support criminalizing this kind of discrimination. But I don't think this is the case. Rather, it seems more like wanting to use the law to force people to stop being something you don't like.

&gt;If you're a baker or a florist or a photograper it's unlikely that any proposed federal anti-discrimination statute would apply to you.

True, but I also think that businesses in general simply refusing service to homosexuals wouldn't fall under any of the proposed legislation, either. Like the Indiana law; you have to be able to make a believable case that having a homosexual eat at your restaurant is against your religion, which isn't likely possible.

For Democrats, it's a common tactic when selling candidates to let people know how important their vote is. That's because Democrats have a smaller electorate whose vote they KNOW they can depend on (people who vote every 2 years), and a bigger electorate who they know will vote Dem but have to be motivated to go vote (people who vote every 4 years). For Republicans, it's the other way around. They have a huge electorate they can rely on to vote every 2 years, but don't have the number of sporadic voters that Democrats have.  

Explaining how important their vote is, how important this election is, how they can change the world with their vote...is literally in every DCCC field training script.

1560,"&gt; I'm taking from this that you are one of the people who believes that Hillary Clinton wants to work to rectify the injustice of maldistribution. 

All this sounds a bit too much like ""Claude Hooper Bukowski"" who believes in God and believes that God believes in Claude.  I don't think anyone is that naive. 

I think Hillary would favor ending maldistribution.  I think that the roots of maldistribution in the US go back to Nixon, that Nixon was a violation of the good that some Republicans had done, and by some I refer to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, and that during the Eisenhower period and then Kennedy-Johnson period the US had made dramatic strides toward reducing maldistribution.

No person is all good or all bad, although Nixon was certainly a prototype of evil and much of the problem of rising maldistribution we have faced and face today appear at least to be related to Republicans who followed Ford.

But part of the problem of rising maldistribution was because of the success at reducing maldistribution that America had experienced up to and including Lyndon Johnson: successes like recovery from the depression, like the GI Bill, like the end of racism in sports but these became associated with Johnson and with the Democratic party.  Johnson too did great things for civil rights.  But as result, Republicans formed a coalition against Johnson based on increasing maldistribution. And various outgrowths of the Republican party since Nixon have geared toward increasing maldistribution ""in reaction to"" what Johnson and the Democrats had achieved, because the Republican party could capture a a huge reactionary movement against civil rights.   Objectively you could not say that Johnson and the Democrats were ""united"" at their core on many issues, they were largely united in support of economic freedom for all  including those who had been wrongfully oppressed.   

The Republican view was that they could create a party by trying to stop this and thus became opposed to any efforts like the GI-Bill, like dual-use and its ability to provide research education which themselves provide both business and military research and capable entrants into the growth economy, and therefore competitive advantage for the United States.  Thus the efforts of Republicans, regardless belief or slogan wind up as both a full attack on the economic advantage of the United States, an abuse and ultimate deterioration of military power, an attack on economic freedom and an attack on sustainability.
 
Today  I hear the RW deplore terms like democracy and equality and one-man one vote, which are  words I grew up with that I associate mathematically with the very strength of this country.  But their attack on these words, as ideologically based as they may seem are an attack on the strength and resilience of the United States.

Does Bernie Sanders understand all of that?  Maybe.  But if we think that some single politician is ""God"" and God believes in Claude, that is not likely to prove correct or useful whether its Sanders or Clinton or whoever.

Democrats control 11 legislatures (4 of those are with a Republican Governor). The remaining eight states have split legislatures.  In 2010, when the most recent census occurred, Republicans emerged from the election with 26 legislatures in which they had outright control, as opposed to the Democrats' 14 (the rest were split), resulting from the Republicans picking up 19 individual chambers.

&gt;I was under the impression that almost everyone was on the same page that man-made C02 pollution contributes to climate change. But contributing to and being the sole reason for are two very different things. 

Scientifically literate people are.  The deniers and the republicans come in 3 basic camps:

1. The climate is not changing at any other rate than it has in the past

2. The climate is changing but it isn't due to man made activity

3. The climate is changing due to man made activity but it is too costly/impossible to fix it.

The Republicans are typically in the 1st and 2nd camps, but there are a few in the 3rd.


&gt;The climate would change without any human intervention due to natural causes, for example: changes in the earths orbit.

The earth's orbit isn't changing. . . so I'm not sure where you got that idea.  But yes, the earth's climate goes through cycles over tens of thousands of years.  There have been many ice ages and warming periods throughout Earth's history.  However, the Anthropological Climate Change theory states that human activity is **expediting** that process.  


&gt;People talk about climate change as if preventing human caused climate change would lead to the Earth having the same climate indefinitely. From what I understand this is just not true. If you were to undo all human-caused climate change and prevented it from ever happening again you would need to take extra steps beyond that to prevent the climate from changing due to natural causes.

1596,"If I thought it would help, I'd vote for him in the primary.  

Where I think you and I would agree, is that there is a problem with the system we have now, as it seems as though there is a possibility of a rehash of 1992; Bush vs. Clinton.  I'm pretty opposed to the dynasty thing.  

I would venture to say that Hillary, and all of her baggage, is probably going to survive primary process.  Martin O'Malley is pretty disliked within his own state, campaigned heavily on gun control (goodbye southern swing states) and will likely crater as he's trying to commandeer a sector of the base Hillary already commands.  

Sanders can unify the far left of the Democrat base, but those blue-dog Democrats aren't going to go for him (and as you venture from the North-East and Pacific Coast, they become far more prevalent).  He's going to have some real problems in Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada (which constitute 75% of the first four primaries).  When we get to Super Tuesday, he's probably not going to carry the following states: Colorado caucuses, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and North Carolina.  He's going to be so far behind by that point that I can't imagine he stays in the race.  

I'm personally going for Rand Paul and I think that he has a better shot, though still not good, than Sanders does of getting the Nomination.  The Republican field is a hell of a lot deeper at this point than the Democrats, so I can't guess how it will go.  However, it's safe to say that the establishment favors Jeb Bush and to a lesser extent Scott Walker (and then Marco Rubio).  The Republicans are in a bit of a civil war so it is feasible that a dark horse could emerge, but we'll see. 

That being said, the Rand Pauls' and Bernie Sanders are likely there solely to steer the national conversation; which while I abhor Sanders' fiscal policies, I agree with him on a lot of Social and Civil Rights issues.  

That's my take on things though, because if we end up with another Clinton Bush ticket, that would mean that for at least 41 years of my life on this planet (at the time of the end of that term) I would have seen presidents from only 4 families (Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama.  An argument could be made that I saw Carter in the White House, but only for a few months and I 6 months old when he left office) in the White House and only three families since I was 9 years old.  That's certainly a problem.

But if you do, please refrain from claiming (incorrectly) that the ACA and Heritage plan bear substantive similarity. They don't.

The Heritage Plan and ACA have **one** (1) point of similarity. The *worst* element of the ACA bears similarity to the *best* element of the Heritage plan.

You can emphasize that element alone, if you wish. But I think it's a politically and rhetorically weak plank to stand on.

Sharing a single similar feature (and a list of radical differences) does not make the plans similar.

Nor did the Heritage foundation discover the concept of adverse selection in health insurance. The individual mandate in the ACA was necessary to overcome that well-known problem and also to reduce insurance industry opposition to the law.

Except I just quite clearly said that I wouldn't do that, and I really don't think anyone else would, either.    

I think the fact that she's a woman doesn't really matter very much in this election, either for her or against her, and I'm delighted that we've finally made enough progress that that's true.   No one is going to vote for her just because she's a woman, not unless they actually agree with her politics; some people probably will vote against her just because she's a woman, but probably most of those people are conservatives who wouldn't have supported anyone with her politics anyway so it shouldn't make much of a difference in the end (except perhaps in the level of vitriol that I expect to see aimed at her from the right).  

This ""people only support her because she's a woman"" is the exact same false narrative that Republicans tried to drum up for 8 years about Obama when they claimed that ""people only supported him because he was black""; it was nonsense then, and it's nonsense now.

1613,"What surprises me is that there are so few Democrat hopefuls.  We're still about a year and a half out from the elections and about a little less than a year from the first of the primaries.  There were 7 or 8 (I'm ballparking) contenders for the Democrat nomination in 08.  Some drop out before they even hit the primaries due to a lack of money and/or support.  What's strange to me is that we have three people so far on the Democrat side, Sanders, O'Malley and Clinton.  

What that says to me (and this is just my perspective) is that the Democrat's establishment views this nomination as Hillary's because it is her turn.  O'Malley is likely in this to start making a national name for himself (which is common, I think Reagan ran one or two times before he won the nomination), Romney ran how many times prior 2012?  The lack of competition for Hillary really makes me wonder why there is so little competition (though it is still early).  


A lot of the Republicans base are the byproduct of the cold war and they over-exaggerate the domestic threat of ISIS (for example).  Growing up in a time when we teetered on the brink of nuclear holocaust and going through drills in school where you prepared (by getting under your desk) for a Soviet nuclear attack, it's understandable.  Hence the inflated military spending (which I agree with you on btw.  We need a formidable military, we don't need one the size we have now).  

I'm something of an isolationist (which is why I like Rand Paul).  If there is a direct threat to America or her allies, then we have to get involved, but I don't think we need to go invade some third world shithole every few years.  The Republicans are pretty bad about this but so are the Democrats.  We were playing both sides of the Syria conflict for awhile.  We helped overthrow and destabilize the Libyan government (Qaddafi wasn't really a threat to us), etc.  Bush certainly played a large role in getting the Middle East to the state that it is in, but Obama's handling of the situation was certainly less than stellar as well.  

The whole religious freedom thing that has been going on with the gay wedding cakes is an interesting view into the difference between Republican and Democrat views on social issues.  The Republican view is that if one owns a business and provides a good or a service to someone, then they should have the right to refuse to do business that goes against their moral conscience.  I may not agree with them that gay marriage is immoral, but I respect their right to do so without government intervention (though if the public lambasts them on social media and they lose enough business as a result that they go under, I'm not necessarily that sympathetic to their plight).  The Democrats believe that a business owner should not have the right to refuse service to someone if they are members of a protected class (gays, minorities, adherents of a different religion, etc).   On it's face, that doesn't sound like such a bad view until you flip it around.  Should a gay baker be forced, under penalty of the law, to cater a luncheon put on by the Westboro Baptist Church (a despicable religion but a religion nonetheless)?  The customer in both instances is a member of a protected class.  I would rather we not force bigots to hide their bigotry in silence and instead allow them to voice it in public (where we can shame them and not support them by patronizing their businesses).  I'm in an interracial relationship and the father of a biracial kid.  I would rather not give my business to someone who loathes me and my family but can't voice that opinion in public.  I think we've evolved enough as a society (as evidenced by that pizza shop shutting down for refusing to cater to homosexuals) to take care of that without government intervention.  

That being said, I don't believe that marriage is a federal issue and should be handled by the states, so my anger at the lack of progress on that front lies with the Republicans at the state level politicians and not the federal.  I opposed the Protection of Marriage Act for the same reason.  

That's just my take on things, your mileage may vary.

Trade agreements are treaties and were treated as such up until Ronald Reagan and Republicans redefined them to circumvent the legislative process which didn't favor their economic agenda.  Reagan and Republicans should have been called out for that BS.  If you had taken the time to read that article instead of setting your hair on fire, you would have picked up on that history lesson.  Here's what you missed:

&gt;Until 1979, every trade agreement that the U.S. had with any nation or nations was a treaty not only in reality but in name  recognized as such. However, in 1979, the U.S. signed the first international trade agreement that the U.S. refused to call a treaty, the Tokyo Round GATT. That sort of thing has happened only four more times, the biggest being NAFTA. And yet even after 1979, the vast majority of international trade agreements to which the U.S. was a signatory were called, even by the U.S., as treaties. 

Beyond that history lesson, what makes you think Congress can effectively *regulate international commerce* when it is denied timely access to trade agreement content and Fast Track authority limits the due diligence to such a short period that it also can't be done effectively?  Are you suggesting that this joke of a review period is Constitutionally compliant?  Seriously?  By your standard, Fast Track authority and the legislative review process are still violating the very spirit and letter of the Constitution even if we ignore your treaty concerns and Global Research.

""Nays (total) 42 (democrats) 0 (republicans) 41""

I've noticed that while the Republicans are full of bad ideas, that the Democrats are nevertheless more likely to close ranks and support terrible ideas for the Party. It's an interesting tendency, and a both a strength and a weakness.

It comes down to this.  If Republicans don't come up with a plan for the roads, the bridges, and the rest of the infrastructure, the states who have followed the Republican cookie-cutter plan are going to choke.  They can call A.L.E.C. anything they want.

That's the whole point - Republicans are doing the exact same thing they complain about. Republicans don't actually care about state's rights or local control - they want things to be controlled at whatever level of government they have control of.

It does sometimes make sense to override local regulations at the state level or state regulations at the federal level. But Republican's don't admit that. They complain about any federal regulations as interfering with state's rights.

I don't know what someone thinks ""was supposed"" to happen.  I know that the availability of grants was cut and I consider that research university funding has been cut.  And I consider that the economic value of research universities is high to the local economies.  But yet the A.L.E.C and other Republican organizations before them have orchestrated enormous cutting of funding for local research universities from 68% to about 6% of operationg costs.

And I consider that this has a detrimental economic impact on the US in current time. And where do these funds now come from?  Tuition.  Students.  And student familes who can ill-afford the rising tuition dictated by the Bobby Jindals and the Scott Walkers. The policies force payment for current economic advantage upon students who are our future.Students from ""out-of-state"" who pay more since the staggering cost cuts make it impossible for local students to go. 


And I also know that Republican leadership would rather get its money from A.L.E.C. than to serve the benefit of its own state:   In Wisconsin.  In Arizona.   And in North Carolina despite the tremendous advantage that these universities have given to those states.  In Georgia. in Louisiana.

Essentially by having students fund current research, A.L.E.C. is having our future pay for the current economy: these students and student families are paying for the economic advantage of the U.S.  Because of A.L.E.C driven policies, these student must support current research instead of the local businesses and economy who immediately benefit from them.  The cost of higher education has been changed from affordable to a prohibitive luxury item for students and student families as they have to no pay for 75% or more of the operating costs of research universities.

We reminded them that when workers have more money, businesses have more customersand need more employees. We reminded them that if businesses paid workers a living wage rather than poverty wages, taxpayers wouldnt have to make up the difference. And when we got done, 74 percent of likely Seattle voters in a recent poll agreed that a $15 minimum wage was a swell idea.
The standard response in the minimum-wage debate, made by Republicans and their business backers and plenty of Democrats as well, is that raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Businesses will have to lay off workers. This argument reflects the orthodox economics that most people had in college. If you took Econ 101, then you literally were taught that if wages go up, employment must go down. The law of supply and demand and all that. Thats why youve got John Boehner and other Republicans in Congress insisting that if you price employment higher, you get less of it. Really?

Because heres an odd thing. During the past three decades, compensation for CEOs grew 127 times faster than it did for workers. Since 1950, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio has increased 1,000 percent, and that is not a typo. CEOs used to earn 30 times the median wage; now they rake in 500 times. Yet no company I know of has eliminated its senior managers, or outsourced them to China or automated their jobs. Instead, we now have more CEOs and senior executives than ever before. So, too, for financial services workers and technology workers. These folks earn multiples of the median wage, yet we somehow have more and more of them.

The thing about us businesspeople is that we love our customers rich and our employees poor. So for as long as there has been capitalism, capitalists have said the same thing about any effort to raise wages. Weve had 75 years of complaints from big businesswhen the minimum wage was instituted, when women had to be paid equitable amounts, when child labor laws were created. Every time the capitalists said exactly the same thing in the same way: Were all going to go bankrupt. Ill have to close. Ill have to lay everyone off. It hasnt happened. In fact, the data show that when workers are better treated, business gets better. The naysayers are just wrong.""",2,0.0843460648148,0.258375798598,0.423553240741,0.315939626523,1.0,1.0,583,0.0497237569061,14.9487179487,-0.0138888888889,0.313888888889

Excuse me?

It's interesting how the Post dissects one of the dozens of times Gruber said about masking the cost of Obamacare in order to get it passed. This article from the post would make sense - if that was the only quote we have a Gruber. And let us not forget our President himself who promised we could keep our doctors, which he knew to be a flat-out lie.

If this was a little bill, it probably wouldn't matter. But this was the biggest piece of legislature in the past 2-3 decades (maybe more), so you can't just throw your hands up in the air and say, ""Oh haha that's how they do it in politics!"".

 I'd like to see Republicans say that when defending Bush's invasion of Iraq, and see how liberals take it. ""haha yea we lied about WMDs. You know, people are stupid. If we told them the truth, we would have never been able to invade Iraq! HAHAHA""

Yea, I'm sure you'd think that's totally legit.

And my initial comment was a joke. But it's also poking at liberals who are quoting an Republican Senator in a Liberal state who is now claiming the court cases are built on lies - that's a story here.

1868,"['global cooling'](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-global-cooling-story-came-to-be/) was a serious thing for only a brief time, only a small number of scientists thought it would happen, and it was seriously blown out of proportion by an article in Newsweek in 1975. By 1980, most climate scientists agreed that carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere was causing an overall warming trend. 

However, it is still a favorite story for conservative talk show hosts to cite in order to prove their point that climate scientists don't know what they're doing. You're allowed to be skeptical in science, but you better have the data to back it up (which is why 'global cooling' isnt a thing anymore). And they call it 'climate change' to reflect all of the manifestations of increased atmospheric CO2, including acidification of the oceans and changing rainfall patterns.

&gt;MOST conservatives are not against trying to mitigate climate change caused by humans. They are simply against massive changes to way and quality of life in order to do so

This is wrong. According to a recently released [Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/182807/conservative-republicans-alone-global-warming-timing.aspx?utm_source=CATEGORY_CLIMATE_CHANGE&amp;utm_medium=topic&amp;utm_campaign=tiles), 70% of conservative Republicans **do not** think human activities are responsible for climate change. 

And you are delusional if you think we can continue to go on with business as usual (i.e. burning all the coal and oil we can extract) and avoid catastrophic climate change. Most scientists think that we could stop burning fossil fuels today, but it's already too late to avoid some of the serious negative consequences. 

Human activities have already raised atmospheric CO2 levels from 280 ppm to over 400 ppm (increase of ~43%) and there's no sign of slowing down. In geological terms, the last time this much CO2 was released in such a short time span was a result of volcanic activity during the [PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum), which resulted in (surprise) global warming and mass extinctions.

1871,"&gt;For 50 years the one person, one vote principle has been used to try to equally distribute political power by counting all people in states and cities, and then putting them into election districts of roughly the same size.

A fine myth, but one that just isn't true. Starting with the Senate where one person in Wyoming has equivalent voting power to over 50 Californians. This leads to our current majority of Senators who represent a minority of the people; while the Senate minority caucus represents a majority of people.

Then we have the Electoral College - if we had a system of one person, one vote then Al Gore would be President, as he got over half a million more votes. But those over half a million votes from across the country were worth less than the votes of 537 people in Florida.

And then there is gerrymandering which is being used to make some votes not as equal as other votes.

Degree inflation. If a bachelor's or master is free, everyone would need that to compete and those with it wouldn't be special at all. Much like everyone is expected to clear high school because it's free, so it would go with college. We already see this because of how ubiquitous college is. Look at countries that pay, they have ways to keep a good portion out of college, that's how they do it. Are you willing to accept that, not getting a career you want because you didn't do quite well enough in high school? 

No way to mandate a degree that has jobs. So we'd pay a ton for useless master's (useless as in 10,000 get them but there's 2,000 jobs).

For every issue, there's a side that someone takes. You can be selfish, and vote for what you want, without assessing the risks/possible outcomes from that law/person elected...

You can be selfless and vote for the law/person who benefits society as a whole, and not just yourself. Examine the law/person closely to be sure that there's little risk, and try to prevent any language that allows the law to be exploited.

&gt;Whenever a lower class Republican votes against their own self-interest, that means they are voting for what they think is best for society.

The issue lies with the republican party itself. They believe in individualism is the best way to make the best life possible for yourself... This comes about due to many Republicans living in rural areas. Democrats tend to live in urban areas where they have to socialize. 

In other words, Republicans are stubborn about everything, and don't change their opinions often. They strive to be an individual that can make it on their own. Democrats can be stubborn, but generally will change their opinion if new information comes about.

It is a rating of a structurally deficient bridge and the rating is assigned by an engineer - when they inspect it.  Until they inspect it, it could be unsafe.

Although unsafe is a number (generally below 4) in the structure of the bridge we don't actually know it is unsafe before such a rating is assigned.

Wrongly. Think of it as a dominoes club where engineers meet and play.

&gt; which is a union of Civil Engineers. 

It's not a union.  It doesn't have a union boss.  It is a forum where engineers publish engineering ideas.

""The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is the oldest engineering society in the United States that caters to over 115,000 professional and 15,000 students in civil engineering. ""

1996,"By itself, it doesn't necessarily do much, but you have to tie it in with the capital gains tax and the corporate income tax (and other taxes). It's extremely complicated, and needs to be simplified, which is one thing the Republicans get right. 

But basically, capital gains taxes are taxes paid on the sale of assets that appreciate in value (stocks, property, business equipment, commercial buildings, etc). There is a difference between short term capital gains (less than one year) and long term, and they are taxed differently. Short term capital gains roughly follow marginal income tax rates (and corporate income tax rates are also similar). In contrast, long term capital gains taxes are lower, to encourage investment in actual property and business assets rather than volatile and risky short term trading on dividends and high risk stock and the like. The problem is that as the marginal income tax rate has dropped, so has the short term capital gains tax, decreasing the advantage in investing in long term, safe assets. The difference is now as little as &lt;15%, meaning if your short term trading leads to more than 15% more profit than a long term investment, you get a higher return, and you get it sooner. Considering the vast amounts of money that flow through Wall Street, that's a fairly easy bar to clear a lot of times. And it only gets less advantageous as you continue to drop the marginal tax rate. 

Now, to be fair, this is all in theory. In reality, GDP growth has shown a fairly low correlation to capital gains tax rates, but part of this is due to the fact that it tends to move together with income taxes. Since the 70s, Democrats tend to raise them together and Republicans tend to drop them together. The only time there was a consistently large gap in top marginal income tax and top capital gains tax was in the 50s and 60s (where the gap was usually 50-70%, which was a time of pretty consistent growth and fairly infrequent bust). 

Of course, there are other ways you could work to fix this. Financial transaction taxes are one way to restrict frequent high risk trading, but it's more of a redistribution than an incentive. High top marginal tax rates can also help to limit executive pay (and combined with the accumulated earnings tax can force companies to invest in higher average employee pay or expanded operations). There's also the regulations on investing with consumer money and how much risk can be taken with large transactions. There's regulation for predatory lending. There's trade deals to keep a level playing field for labor. There's tighter oversight of the Fed and its ability to bail out failed institutions and control interest rates (the Fed's silent bailout of the banks by just printing money and absorbing junk assets makes the Congressional government bailout look like child's play). 

There are so many moving parts that it's hard to say what exactly is the ""right"" answer, if such a thing exists. It's difficult enough to even know which lever would yield the best results. But regardless of what politicians (in particular, the GOP, though Dems own their fair share of policy missteps) will say, most data points to the fact that overall economic policy since the early 80s is an unsustainable disaster that has only been avoided through sheer force of the Fed's intervention and a global willingness to ignore debts and deficits in order to stave off a global sustained depression.

In fiscal year 2011, lawmakers shaved $128 million off of the administration's request for embassy security funding. House Republicans drained off even more funds in fiscal year 2012 -- cutting back on the department's request by $331 million**

2010,"""Nifty"" is an understatement.  I thought the graph was totally cool.  I noticed a couple interesting things. From the years 1899 to 1962, Republicans always scored higher in ideology than Democrats.  That's a span of 64 years! It flipped from 1964 to 1984.  For the next twenty years, Democrats consistently scored more ideological than Republicans.  From 1985 on, it went back the other way. Republicans are more ideological.  The gist of the graph, however, was to illustrate the gap between Democrats and Republicans.  The current gap is widening and is historically unprecedented. True, it is mostly due to Republicans moving farther to the right.  But, both Democrats and Republicans have been less ideological in the past. I was very curious to know how they *measured* the ideological score. Did you find a link to it?  I don't imagine it's as straight forward as measuring batting average or ERA.

I know Brookings is measuring *conservative ideology*, but neither conservatism nor liberalism are ideologies.  Libertarianism, Fascism, Communism and other [governmental forms](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81CFMeTqmWL._SY355_.jpg) are ideologies.  They use ideal models and have relatively fixed systems of belief. Conservatism, on the other hand, is no more than opposition to change. It may even look backward (reactionary).  I think of it like a motor-sport competition similar to a tractor pull.  The tractor is liberalism (a force for change) and conservatism is the sled (a weight that holds back change).  The farther the tractor goes, the more weight placed on the sled. The tractor that pulls the most weight the farthest is the winner. Eventually, a tractor stops because it can no longer pull all the weight.  Conservative ideology, like the weight on the sled, builds as liberalism pulls forward. But the tractor does make progress.  A new normal is set, and the competition starts over again. Conservatism is not ideological, it's just the dead weight of tradition and history.

I agree.  With you, not the conservatives.  I think if your going to get an abortion it should be done asap.  I'm also perfectly fine with early term abortions, if a qualified doctor is willing to do It, they shouldn't have to jump through legal red tape to do so.  This causes women to seek out less than ideal options (ie hacks that don't really know what they're doing).

My mother owns a business she started in her forties that now makes her enough money for her and my father to live comfortably if my father lost his job again. Now myself, at 18 I started a business with a friend and ran it successfully for four years; after that we started a second company that now employs 25 people.

Pataki hasn't held an elected office since the mid 2000's and wasn't very popular at the end of his term. Also he represents the moderate Republicans, who are probably the most marginalized and least vocal group of Republicans in this election. Paul is popular amongst a growing demographic of Republicans (libertarians) and is currently a Senator.

Basically the difference is that Paul is actually polling significant numbers and is being ignored by Fox for political reasons (his libertarianism does not agree with typical conservatism) whereas Pataki is polling poorly enough (he's almost last out of every single notable Republican running) to where it would make sense to not include him in coverage and also probably wouldn't be blacklisted by Fox for his relatively conventional views for a Republican.

That and the fact that Rand was far more critical of religious people than she was of democrats. And why? Because religious people eschew reason. Ayn Rand was chiefly a proponent of reason, her libertarian-like political philosophy was only incidental to her deeper philosophy, that of reason.

To me it's one of the clearest signs that most republicans don't really study anything at all, nor do they engage in critical thinking. Because had an appreciable number of them actually read and thought critically about the messages in the book then they either would change their philosophical and political opinions, or they would stop endorsing her work.

2071,"I will gladly elaborate. First of all, the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is that while the Republicans have NO ONE interested in helping out the middle class and the poor, the Democrats have Barry Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and a few others. Maybe half a dozen in Congress, total. But that still puts them well ahead of the Republicans.

Second, Obama's bailout was a success. Its intended goal was to halt the tailspin the economy was in and to help the economy recover fast. It did that. It also got the banks out of the mess they had created, but that was a side effect. Also, most of the money given in the bailout has been paid back.

Where Obama failed was in not also helping out all the middle class and poor homeowners who were hurt by the crash. Obama and his Democratic colleagues little or nothing to help out average Americans in that respect. There was a fund set up to help middle class homeowners, but it wasn't a big fund in relation to the banks, it was very slow to pay out and didn't actually get much done. A halfhearted effort, at best, of which Obama and the Democrats should be deeply ashamed. What's more, if the Democrats and/or Obama HAD made a real effort to help middle class homeowners, you can be SURE that the Republicans would have been howling like dogs about the expense of it.

Obama's deepest failure may have been in the area of justice: his justice department, presumably under his orders, refused to criminally prosecute any individuals for what they had done. They just prosecuted bank buildings and fined them what was for them small change. This was a huge moral failure on Obama's part, basically saying ""It's OK to be a criminal if you're a big enough criminal."" I was disgusted by it. And I know why it happened: Democrats like Wall Street campaign contributions just as much as Republicans do. In that respect, both parties are identical, with the exception of a handful of Democrats (Sanders, Warren and friends.)",4,-0.00354651162791,0.332406716568,0.370555555556,0.284595708232,1.5,1.0,359,0.0402010050251,17.95,-0.02,0.306666666667

That's a huge assumption, with a really odd ""because.""  I agree that some pro-lifers are absolute hypocrites that don't want to expand maternal care.  But many I have known do.

I think it has more to do with pro life / pro choice being split between republicans and democrats.  ""Pro life"" Republicans love slashing social programs, so those who are really sincerely pro life are stuck with a party that clashes with their goals whichever way they turn.

This is why (IMHO) the abortion issue tracks so oddly with the progressive movement as a whole.

TOPEKA, Kan.  With the state facing a $400 million budget hole for the coming fiscal year, the conservatives who dominate the Legislature here say they are agonizing over the likelihood of doing something that did not seem to be in their DNA: raising taxes.

Just three years ago, many of these lawmakers passed the largest tax cuts in state history, saying they would lead to economic growth. But that growth did not appear, and after repeatedly trimming spending to close shortfalls, legislators again find themselves in a prolonged budget battle with no easy answers, where both houses of the Republican-controlled Legislature are proposing tax increases.

The reason: even anti-tax Republicans are acknowledging that there is not much more to cut without significantly hurting popular programs, including education.

The fault lines now seem to run along the question of which taxes to raise. Some believe that income taxes are off limits and that they should raise sales taxes to shoulder the entire burden. Others advocate a mixed approach and said income taxes should be on the table. Democrats argue that increasing sales taxes would be another blow to low-income Kansans to the benefit of the business class.

And many worry that the only solution will be to repeal the signature piece of the law they passed in 2012: the elimination of taxes on certain types of small businesses.

I have to talk to myself about it before I reach that step, said Senator Les Donovan, a Republican who is chairman of the Senates tax committee. Im not in favor of raising taxes. Id much rather be able to see growth take care of what we do.

Mr. Donovan has proposed removing the exemption on nonwage income for small businesses, instead giving them a 1 percent payroll tax credit. His bill also calls for increasing the sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on everything except food, which would be taxed at 6 percent.

The tax battle has pit conservative against conservative and produced all sorts of procedural bickering and legislative posturing. As lawmakers have vowed to work through the weekend, the legislative session will reach the 100-day mark on Saturday for just the sixth time in state history. (Sessions are typically limited to 90 days, and each additional day costs around $40,000.)

In addition to ending taxes on some small businesses, lawmakers passed legislation in 2012 and 2013 phasing in rate reductions on personal income taxes  to 3.9 percent from 6.45 percent on the high end and 2.3 percent from 3.5 percent on the low end  by 2018. The reductions were expected to cost a total of about $7 billion through 2019, according to legislative researchers.

Since those changes, Gov. Sam Brownback and lawmakers have found themselves repeatedly tinkering with the budget to fill hundreds of millions of dollars in shortfalls. The governor has cut some state agency budgets by 4 percent, reduced contributions to the state pension system and shifted money between state accounts. Lawmakers have rolled back funding for poorer school districts and changed the way they allocate money to schools. They have slowed funding increases for entitlement programs.

Mr. Donovan said the results of the tax law were never as good as we hoped.

We hoped they would just be a magic lantern and everybody would react to it, he said. But, eh, its hard to get a company to uproot their business when theyre established and move to another place just because of this difference in tax policy.

Still, supporters of the tax bills are not necessarily willing to concede that the cuts were the reason for the states fiscal problems.

Senator Terry Bruce, the Republican majority leader, said that when the cuts were passed, the Department of Revenue gave estimates of how much the changes would cost that ended up being inaccurate.

While initial estimates, for instance, were that the small business tax exemption would affect about 191,000 entities and cost about $160 million, for the 2013 tax year, 333,000 filers took advantage of the exemption at a cost of $206.8 million, according to the Revenue Department.

I dont know if it was a mistake and the intention was wrong or the effect is wrong, Mr. Bruce said of the tax law. It was very aggressive, very quick.

The House plan would tax the nonwage income on small businesses at 2.7 percent and increase the sales tax to 6.45 percent, but reduce it to 5.9 percent for food.

Some Republicans are holding the conservative line, saying cuts to bureaucracy could close most, if not all, of the gap.

Theres definitely waste in the budget, Senator Dennis Pyle, a Republican, said in an interview. Its my goal to not raise taxes. We have to let the private sector breathe and operate as freely as possible because that is the revenue driver.

But Democrats called the Republican proposals inadequate for fixing the budget woes. Theres a lot of things you could do to show that you are concerned about all Kansans, said Valdenia Winn, a Democratic representative. But are they doing it? Nope. So your little piecemeal baby steps dont impress me one bit. Theyre desperate because you still have those Tea Party people who cannot go home and say, I had to vote for tax increases. 

Some Kansas small-business owners were mixed about whether they needed the tax exemption.

Ryan D. Hall, who started his own radiology company in central Kansas last year, said he was not receiving the exemption because all of the money his limited-liability company earned was counted as wages, and the exemption applies only to non-wage income. Yet he said that he hoped to expand his business, and that if he hired employees and bought a building, the exemption could come in handy.

It would be nice to have down the road, Mr. Hall said of the exemption. They could close the deficit without eliminating this particular provision.

Marena Mitchell, who runs a speech and occupational therapy company in suburban Kansas City, said she appreciated the exemption. Still, she was not even sure how much money the exemption had saved her company, Bringing Therapy Home, since she formed it two years ago. If it was significant, then losing it might increase costs, and she might have to pass those on to the families she treats.

Yet as a former speech pathologist for a school district, Ms. Mitchell said she would support giving up the exemption for the right reason.

I would be O.K. getting rid of that exemption if it supported education, she said.",10,0.0769341817187,0.245792355464,0.510651340996,0.328480826604,1.3,1.0,1098,0.046686746988,19.9636363636,0.370833333333,0.629166666667

Here are the results from the research of  [Nicholas Goedert](http://artsci.wustl.edu/~ng/research.html).

&gt;In every state districted by Republicans, Democrats won fewer seats than their historical expectation, and in six cases they underperformed by 20% or more (as a percentage of total seats up for election).   So it appears that Republicans gained benefits across the board from controlling the redistricting process.

&gt;[Table1](http://i.imgur.com/v8OdT7X.png)


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;By contrast, Democrats exceeded their expected seat share only slightly in the three states where they controlled the process.  As shown in Table 2, Democrats gained just a fractional seat above expectation in each such state.  For instance, Illinois Democrats won a smaller majority in their delegation than Pennsylvania or Ohio Republicans won in theirs, despite winning a much larger vote share.

That's not just Republicans. That's most of your long time politicians in the pocket of big business.

&gt;I don't have to accept the premise.

You kind of do. The government has a strict set of rules in the Constitution. How it is interpreted can vary, but whatever that interpretation is, it isn't meant to be applied only in a case by case basis.

&gt;Which is exactly what Citizens United does. It violates the right to vote at the most essential time of that right and thereby erases it.

&gt;Citizens United decides there really is no right to vote, no ""one man one vote"" no input from the powerless, no democracy - just dictatorship. Everything we hold dear, everything in the Declaration of Independence is lost under Citizens United which sets up the powerful, once again as rulers in the pink satin pants.

&gt;And worse, the pink satin then leverage their power to jerrymander away democracy. It could be the worst kind of corruption this country has ever seen. At least the worst since 1849.

CU doesn't violate anyone's right to vote. Everyone has an independent choice over who they want to vote for. It may put more power of influence with people with more money, and that isn't right, but that's an indirect effect of the law, not the actual law itself.

&gt;&gt;I don't have to accept the premise.

&gt;You kind of do. 


Nope. Government is what we decide it is.

&gt;The government has a strict set of rules in the Constitution.

There is no ""the"" government.  There is the US government and the Constitution identifies human rights.   There are not 1,300 sentences and phrases that identify what it says.   And there is certainly no slippery statement that equates money and speech anywhere in the Constitution, or that says the rights of a free people can exist when their particular rights are ""overruled"" by money interest.

That isn't in the Constitution.  If it is, quote it.

&gt;How it is interpreted can vary,

Contradicting oneself doesn't emphasize or deliniate the reasons for the government of a free people.


&gt;CU doesn't violate anyone's right to vote.

Clearly it does. 

&gt;Everyone has an independent choice over who they want to vote for.

There are cynical people who claim that there is no choice. And other cynical people who strongly believe that their money influences choice.  

And I think the 2nd group are correct which is why I have always respected the decision of the State of New York to not place undue influence on voters.    CU is all about magnifying that influence and nothing in CU is about giving people more choice.

&gt; It may put more power of influence with people with more money, and that isn't right, but that's an indirect effect of the law, 

Given the power and influence of those who have been able to receive the decision  I can not agree its any thing but the desired, direct effect. 

The indirect effect is additional gerrymandering that has further subverted the ""choice"" of the people of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Florida, and other places.

I didn't say I don't want to hear about them. I said you're not making sense when you talk about them. You are trying to use them to represent something, but I'm not exactly sure what.

What particular abuses of power are you talking about? Like, I'm genuinely asking because I don't know. Not voting for top down education legislation isn't an abuse of power, it's believing that education works better the more locally it is controlled. Similar with the environment, though I'll agree that many Republicans are completely ignorant of the facts.

&gt;The main issue? There's no free market for health care. This predates the ACA. You can't move. You have to deal with networks. Suppose you live in one of our multi-city metro areas like Dallas - Ft. Worth (just a sample).

&gt;Suppose you do move. If you want your existing doctor in Ft. Worth, they might not be able to refer you to a specialist in Dallas. Why? Because they're ""not in network.""

&gt;Ok free market experts. What does that mean? Huh? It means the doctor you go to, despite being less than 50 miles from a specialist can't refer you to that specialist. So if you move from Ft. Worth to Dallas you have to make EVERY trip back to Ft. Worth for EVERY specialist for EVERY thing you need.

&gt;Or - you change primary care doctors. Do you want to change doctors? No? Do you want to drive back to Fort Worth for EVERY visit? No.

&gt;You're stuck. Why are you stuck?

&gt;It's called ""restraint of trade"" Buffalo Bob.

&gt;So tell me about all the sins of the ACA after you fix the previous ones first. 

First of all, that's completely irrelevant to the matter at hand. I'm talking about the ability to compel commerce. That's a problem whether you have a free market or not. I agree the healthcare market is the farthest thing from free, but it is still a product you purchase. The concern about ACA is that the individual mandate opens the flood gates for other laws compelling purchases. That's a valid concern regardless of what other issues the mandate has.

Second of all, the whole reason you have just significant issues with doctors being ""out of network"" is because of HMOs and managed care, an institution the Government helped establish.

&gt;True. But not since ""WW2."" Nixon's the one.

Yes since WW2. Wage restrictions were placed on companies, so to get around it, they offered healthcare benefits. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States#The_rise_of_employer-sponsored_coverage

&gt;This is all about ""managed care."" I can see that some libertarians might not like Republicans who created this. I can see that. But there's a lot of overlap between Scott Walker and the Koch brothers right now that kind of makes what ever differences there are between the two moot.

What I thought you said was it made on sense at all.  Does some of it make sense, but you simply disagree?

&gt;What particular abuses of power are you talking about? 

The abuse of a power is to attack the power of Congress over corporations power that belongs to Congress in accordance with the Constitution, some of which Congress has exercised over corporations since 1907?

I doubt that very much.

Re Health care:
&gt;First of all, that's completely irrelevant to the matter at hand. 

You wrote about it.   You wrote about problems with the ACA.  I'm telling you there are more problems with the framework that a Republican should probably care about even more.  And that need to be dealt with first because it has caused enormous damage to the economy of the United States, and it is a subject that Republicans generally agree on and agree with Libertarians on: free trade.

&gt;True. But not since ""WW2."" Nixon's the one.
Yes since WW2.

By Nixon.  There were not wage and price restrictions surviving ""world war 2.""  Nixon did them.

""Nixon's the one.""

&gt;I don't see how Scott Walker and the Koch brothers have anything to do with this.

The Koch brothers headed the Libertarian party having taken it over from John Anderson and the wine and cheese crowed.  Koch money is making Scott Walker central to the Republican Party.

Therefore they are fatefully linked at this point and have chosen one of the worst disasters in American history: the death of research universities to unite around.

The Republican party today has a ""Southern"" leadership conference.  But hasn't the party written off the North East?  And thus we can expect no ""Sandy relief.""  We were not able to expect George W. Bush to provide relief from the massive offshoring of manufacturing jobs from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania, to Ohio. 

My sense is this started when the Rockefeller wing of the party walked out in 1964 shouting ""Julian Bond.""  When I posted the problem with rail service between Washington DC and Raleigh North Carolina and mentioned how deteriorating infrastructure causes backups all the way to Boston, what I got from Republicans was that was such a ""small area.""

And on what basis do you see this being a parallel to climate change?

&gt; Oops, no we don't say global warming because we need to keep our options open if the globe isn't actually heating up. Call it 'climate change'.

You know, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created in 1988, right? And I can find papers at least a decade older than that talking about global climate change. Global warming and climate change are two different, but closely related, topics, which have both been discussed in the scientific literature for decades.

You know why you started hearing about ""climate change"" rather than ""global warming""? It wasn't because of ""keeping our options open if the globe isn't actually heating up"": it's because [a Republican strategist wrote a memo suggesting that the Republicans rebrand it because Americans find the term ""climate change"" less scary than ""global warming""](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange).

&gt; Never mind that climates have been changing since the formation of the earth eons ago. 

Of course climate has changed in the past. However, the global climate over the entire history of human civilization has been *remarkably* stable, and the current changes driving the climate changes are unprecedented in many millions of years (as are some of the rates of change).
