&gt; Trucco found that sure enough, whenever a new iPhone is released searches for the phrase rocket upwards while similar searches tuned to Android devices do not correlate at all with the launch of new devices, and simply trend upwards over the years as manufacturers sell more devices.

&gt; By this he means that when Apple releases a new iPhone they also tend to launch an update to their mobile operating system - one that is designed to take advantage of all the new hardware, but that doesn&amp;#039;t play quite so smoothly with older devices.

&gt; This suggestion is then that when Apple push out an update to iOS they inadvertently hobble anything that isn&amp;#039;t their latest device, with the spike in searches attributed to the fact that Apple is very good at encouraging people to update their software.

10,"Keep in mind, my original comment was focused on the smart device market. I was specifically talking about how new it was -- profit margins are absolutely massive there. Even the less competent players have been making a killing -- they'll get pushed out as margins come down.

But you are right, prices won't necessarily come down for them. Apple has a couple of options worth mentioning -- they can attempt to sell devices for less, and keep the same volume, or they can sacrifice volume while keeping prices the same. They've been doing the latter (the market as a whole is still growing fast enough that they're still having record sales, though). They're letting the competition take advantage of falling prices, while they go the opposite direction and try to pack more hardware and features in, in order to stand out and keep their pricing. I'm having a really hard time thinking what Apple can do to keep up this charade, which is why I suspect that they'll be inevitably forced to bring their prices down, but in the meantime, they can keep playing that game with the smart watch market they've just entered.

In the PC space, Apple's competition is basically incompetent. They can charge more because very few people *want* a Dell -- just about anybody would prefer a Mac bootcamped with Windows over a Dell of comparable specs and performance. PC manufacturers have been obsessed with racing to the bottom, while Apple has been going the opposite direction, putting more expensive components in their products. With the smartphone market, it's different -- virtually all of the flagship phones are very appealing and competitive. Apple's been very innovative in the PC space lately, whereas with the smartphone market, they've started running out of cards to play.

Here's Apple's app-of-the-week.  [Mighty Switch Force! Hose It Down](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mighty-switch-force!-hose/id922587565?mt=8).  Woo.

Just upon launching the app it connects to a couple Facebook servers (including graph.facebook), stats.unity3d.com (Unity's own tracking service for games that use their SDK), Appspot.com, Mobileapptracking.com, Google, Amazonaws (there's no telling what this will be used for.  Sometimes it's the developers own data collection, sometimes it's legitimate game resources.)

Apple restricts storage to a couple key locations, and what is this developer using it for?  Well, there's a single savefile.sav in here for the actual game.  I also have several of Google's analytics logs, some Facebook logs, and the MobileAppTracking ID which is a unique fingerprint they apply in order to track my usage across apps and devices as seen in classes such as their MATAppToAppTracker and MATUtil.

Many of these services keep the data encrypted, here's an example of a log from MAT: http://i61.tinypic.com/2a9zi3l.png with the uniquely identifying stuff blurred.  This is something the app compiles whenever I use it in order to send it off to their servers.  If I'm not online, it'll report it at the next available opportunity.  There's a lot more they can gather over natively running code than Verizon's 'super cookie' trackers ever could from a browser.

So I don't even need to use a Facebook or Google service to still be tracked by them because they've bundled their software in the apps I'm running.  Note that nowhere on their app page they disclose any of this stuff.  If you go to their website, they have a privacy statement for using the website, but nothing about the stuff they've snuck into your game.

38,"&gt; But where's the line? There must be some level of software development that is so new and surprising that it entitles the developer to protection. Maybe software needs a sui generis system of protection.

When something is released that is new and innovative and blows minds that is EXACTLY when that thing should be copied and iterated upon.

When computers were first invented that was a MAJOR innovation and it blew peoples' minds but like most first iterations of technology the first computers sucked. If people didn't shameless rip their idea off then the guy who made the first computer would be the only person who could ever innovate on that idea and computers would still absolutely suck.

Every great piece of technology is made by smart people shamelessly ripping off each other's ideas.

&gt;However, absent some system of protection, I cannot imagine why many people would develop AND DISCLOSE their inventions. This is why the patent system was, arguably, put in place - to encourage disclosure of new and useful inventions to the public. In exchange for a full disclosure of how to make and use an invention, the inventor gets the right to exclude (for a limited time) others from practicing the invention. Thus, allowing inventors to commercialize their inventions without others merely copying without putting any of the development work, and thus, go to market at a lower price.

But the open source movement is in direct opposition to this statement. In fact, if anything, the MOST innovation tends to come from open source projects.

Speaking of innovation let's look at some recent innovations in technology.

The Apple Watch recently launched. It's been a wildly successful product and hailed as another great innovation from Apple but where did it come from? Well in this case Apple is shamelessly ripping off existing Smartwatches as they do with most of their innovations. Does this mean Apple should be sued because they shamelessly ripped off existing Smartwatches and are a plague on the industry? No. In fact Smartwatches will continue to improve precisely because Apple shamelessly ripped off an earlier product and smartwatches will continue to rip eachother off and improve directly because of that. Does that mean innovators will be pushed away from the industry because they know they are going to be ripped off? All evidence points to the contrary. The creator's of the Pebble are not destitute because of Apple. If anything Apple has helped them by competing with them. Now all those people who bought Apple's product are new potential customers who have entered that field and Pebble can improve their product and poach those customers by shamelessly ripping off every good idea from the Apple Smartwatch.

What about Oculus Rift? They intentionally released their designs so that other tech companies would compete with them. Why did they do this? Because they realize that if they released a product and didn't have other companies ripping them off then they would end up releasing an ultimately inferior product that would not appeal to as wide of an audience. By giving themselves competition they have given themselves a pool of people who they can steal ideas from to make a better product and by making a better product they can appeal to an even wider audience than they could have if they had a monopoly.

Innovation is not stopped by copycats. Copycats ARE the ones driving innovation.",1,0.199713318596,0.261100573717,0.516800221056,0.276910888878,1.275,0.85,579,0.0434782608696,18.09375,0.25,0.25

Amazon killed the independent writers with their reach and pretty much said that if you wanted to sell through the worlds largest bookstore, you needed to sell for next to nothing, and you needed to still let Amazon take something like a 70% cut.  And they could change the price at any time -- and only give you the cut based on the new discounted price. 

As a musician, I personally don't care if Walmart sold a CD of mine that was a MSRP of $16.99 for $7.99.  Why?  Because I still got paid based on the MSRP and not what the selling price.  HOWEVER, with these new streaming services?  We get almost nothing.  The laws were changed several years ago so that music bloggers could post songs and not be priced out of the game -- and somehow the big companies found a way (just like we said would happen), and they found a way to put our songs out there a million times a day and give almost nothing for them.  

In Apple's eBook case -- their ONLY requirement was that publishing houses could set their prices.  I.e., the MSRP.  if someone like Amazon wanted to buy the book in bulk and sell it below cost, technically they could.  However, the authors / publishers would get paid based on the MSRP.  This was very convoluted in the trial and in reporting, but nothing ever stopped Amazon from selling below cost.  Nothing.  However, Apple gave the publishers a way to fight back against the worlds largest book store (the one that owns like 70% of the sales of published written books worldwide and 90% of the electronic market)...Amazon used its monopoly to steamroll indies and then even treated the big publishers as if they were the same.  

Apple gave them the ability to take back some of the control and fight back against the monopoly.  

In the music sales world?  Apple is the gorilla.  However, as an artist, they were always the most fair.  Even back in the day with CD Baby and its artist-centric model, they acted as a label would and found ways of keeping as much as they could.  Ironically, Apple was the most fair to content creators.  

Are they perfect?  Fuck no.  Hell, if I were still in the game, I'd have been pushing for Tidal because it is even more artist-centric than anyone else.  

But back to your two sentence statement that I seem to have blown up...it is anti-competitive only depending on what audience you are looking at.  Amazon is anti-competitive to content creators.  Apple is anti-competitive to others.  All companies are going to be anti-competitive in one way or another...you just have to choose who you are aligning yourself with.  Being that I'm a content creator (writer, musician)...I like Apple.  As a consumer?  I still buy from Amazon!

&gt; The Verge has learned that Apple has been pushing major music labels to force streaming services like Spotify to abandon their free tiers, which will dramatically reduce the competition for Apple&amp;#039;s upcoming offering.

&gt; Apple has been using its considerable power in the music industry to stop the music labels from renewing Spotify&amp;#039;s license to stream music through its free tier.

&gt; Getting the music labels to kill the freemium tiers from Spotify and others could put Apple in prime position to grab a large swath of new users when it launches its own streaming service, which is widely expected to feature a considerable amount of exclusive content.

&gt; Scale is a magic word for so many cloud-based companies and services, but Beats and Spotify operate differently. Their margins dont improve as they get larger. If Spotify bought the rights to songs for a flat rate, then every subscriber it adds would mean free money for the company. But that isnt what it does. Instead, **it spends a fixed proportion of its total revenue on royalties. So if Spotify doubles its subscriber base, it doubles the amount of money it pays out.**

&gt; According to a report published by Generator Research last November, the current business model for streaming music is inherently unprofitable. Andrew Sheehy, the main author of the report, concluded: Our analysis is that no current music subscription serviceincluding marquee brands like Pandora, Spotify, and Rhapsodycan ever be profitable, even if they execute perfectly.

&gt; The company does say **its contracts are structured so about 70 percent of its revenue goes to royalties.**

Licensing is killing their profitability AND artist profits. The big record companies get their money without doing jack shit. Apple is probably trying to use their market power to get lower royalty prices.

&gt; Apples interest in Beats is an acknowledgment of the changing times, says Rich Karpinski, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group. Everyone is waiting for Apple to make its move, he says. In some ways this validates the area. Apple declined to comment. The acquisition could tilt the balance of power in several ways.

If you saw an eBook that was priced too high you could report it and they'd actually fix it, often within 48 hours.

Then Apple decided they wanted to be in on eBooks, but that they didn't want to compete with those prices.  So they banded together with 3 or 4 big publishers who basically told Amazon to raise prices or they'd pull their books, eBooks *and* paper books, from the site.  Amazon stood firm for a couple months and sure enough, they had to stop selling tons of books to do it.  Finally they just had to give in.

The sad thing is it took years and years for this to even come forth with a law suit and for Apple and those publisher to be found guilty.  The damage was already done, there was no taking back the higher prices.  So they still won.

140,"&gt;The private collusion was the problem. They should have been out in the open about this.

Either in private or public, companies colluding to raise the price of a good in a market is illegal.

&gt;As for the agreed upon price...it was AMAZON'S agreed upon price. They put an upper limit on the price of the book, and said they weren't paying anything more. And they said they wanted to have most favored nation status, and if anyone sold lower -- even if they were taking a loss -- Amazon could immediately renegotiate the price to their favor and readjust the wholesale price to make it 'fair'.

Nope, that was Apple.  Apple got the ""most favoured"" status in that nobody could sell lower than them.  Amazon negotiated with each publisher, and each publisher was free to do business with them or not.  They got together with apple to bully amazon into raising prices.  You've entirely got the situation backwards over who was getting special treatment.  Amazon's sale prices came out of amazon's share for distribution, cutting into their own margin and not the publishers.  The publishers wanted higher overall prices for more income, and a larger share of those prices too.

&gt;The publishers had no room for negotiation...if they didn't want Amazon's price, Amazon would start deleting their titles and making them unavailable. Ask Hatchette about how this worked.

Again, you have no understanding of what happened.  The publishers were free to do business with whomever they wanted, and make agreements for any price they could negotiate.  Amazon wasn't interested in expensive books. 

Amazon takes a 30% cut off the agreed upon price of the books, and prices lower than that bite into only amazon's share.  The 30% is the same amount Apple, Google, Valve, and many other digital distributors take.  Hachete was trying to negotiate a large share than the 70% they were taking.  What amazon did was say that book publishers who pushed for high prices didn't get pre-order buttons for their books, losing them huge volumes of sales.    But amazon is not obligated to offer pre-order sales for books for a publisher its negotiating with. 

Rather than negotiate with amazon and create a competitive market, they colluded with apple to create a minimum price for ebooks and make apple the cheapest game in town.  nobody was allowed to sell books cheaper than apple.  We aren't even talking wholesale price here - if apple sold a book for $15, nobody could sell it cheaper.

It's disgusting and anti consumer and anti competition and you're completely reversing the situation about who had ""most favoured"" status and who had no room for negotiations.  The publishers removed any negotiation from amazon to raise prices.  That's the very nature of no competition markets they created, and thats why they and apple got punished for it.

Had the exact opposite interaction with them over releasing songs on iTunes.  Though this was about 7-8 years ago now so it may have changed.  Apple wanted sole release on iTunes.  No other digital distribution.  They didn't even want us to link a free track on the website.  We included high quality samples on CD for anyone to do remixes and iTunes would not make that content available at all.  Apple also had a bunch of regional release issues.  We sold more CDs to Germany than we had at local shows and our record stores.  We couldn't get an iTunes release in Germany.  Sweet, that totally doesn't help us.  

Your mileage may vary.  That said digital distribution was still pretty new so maybe they got their act together since then.  It really soured me on them as a source of music though.",4,0.189381313131,0.216740999679,0.414974747475,0.288243129865,0.9,0.8,155,0.0326086956522,11.0714285714,0.3,0.475

195,"Generally Apple has strong favor among artists in the industry, and that's because of their past treatment and focus on the artist.

Currently, very high profile artists like Taylor Swift and Radiohead are speaking out against Spotify, while still maintaining their work on iTunes.  Taylor Swift and Radiohead's Thom Yorke pulled their music from Spotify to make a statement.

From http://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-needs-to-lose-free-option-opinion/:

&gt; One of the biggest fallacies about the music industry, and one used especially when trying to justify low streaming payouts, is that musicians make money from touring. Yes, mega-acts like the Rolling Stones, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga -- and, indeed, even Jay Z and superstar spouse Beyonc -- can gross tens of millions of dollars on the road, but many musicians touring today are lucky if they make enough to pay for the tour itself before going back to their day jobs, or unemployment. When you add the cost of making and distributing an album to ""promote"" these tours, it becomes a very costly ""hobby."" Music was already a tough industry for many people to make money in, and streaming is currently making it tougher.
&gt; 
&gt; If an artist or an artist's record company paid money to have a record made, it makes sense that they deserve some recompense. While record companies appear happy with the current system, it seems that every day we see a story about how pitiful the payouts to artists are. In April, Portishead guitarist Geoff Barrow said he received 1,700, about $2,500, for 34 million streams on Spotify.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite such poor payouts, it's still possible to make money on the Internet -- if you make videos, that is. For example, YouTube celebrity PewDiePie rakes in $4 million a year from his gaming videos, and he only needs a webcam and an Internet connection. Compare this with the comparatively high overhead of a touring band -- string sections, record production and tour buses -- and it's clear that streaming audio is not up to the level of profitability that video offers yet. But as many young people listen to music on YouTube there is definitely an opportunity for artists to control their revenue via the video-streaming site.

214,"&gt;so your argument is that apple is attempting to legally fuck up it's competitors business practice ""for the good of the artist"".

No, that's not the argument.  The argument is that Apple wants to put together a streaming service.  They want to do it in a way that makes everyone happy:  Apple, the customers, the record labels, and the artists.  The question is, how will that be possible?

In order to please the customers, they need to be able to listen to whatever they want, whenever they want, for as little money as possible.

In order to please the record labels, Apple is going to need to pay the labels some amount of money for every listen that a song has.  *This has to come from somewhere*.

In order to please the artists, Apple is going to need to pay the artists some amount of money for every listen that a song gets.  *This has to come from somewhere*.

In order to please Apple and pay the developers that design and maintain the service and backend of things and host all this stuff, Apple needs to bring some money in for every song that's played.

Money in has to equal money out + profit.

So:

Apple Streaming Service Income = Payouts and costs

Ad revenue + monthly paying customers + clickthrough sales = Payout to Labels + payout to Artists + development costs + maintenance costs + profit

This equation is what the discussion is all about.

Right now, the same equation is being used at Spotify HQ, but the freemium service has 0 for monthly payments income, and all revenue is from ads.  And the payout is to Spotify and to the labels; very little is going to the artist.

I can tell you Apple is more concerned about creating a popular and sustainable service, than taking a crap on Spotify.  Spotify will be gone in a few years.  The entire business is streaming music.  There are SO MANY people entering this space, that if Spotify doesn't diversify its technological portfolio, someone is just going to buy them and throw it away.  If Apple was really concerned with Spotify, they would buy it.  But it's clear that Apple believes they can do something better.

That's the entire point of this article - Apple is trying to get rid of free streaming services so that there is actually money out there to pay artists.  They are even going so far as to say ""we will pay the licensing fees so that you will still get paid"" to the labels.

&gt; seems to me that they are coming in with their own streaming service and want to get rid of the competition as fast as they can(spotify).

Apple already has higher marketshare in the US than Spotify.  iTunes Radio is more popular than Spotify, and the iTunes store is the most popular digital store.  They are already ahead.

SO OF COURSE RECORD LABELS GET PAID, THEY OWN THE FUCKING MUSIC.

So, I hear you.  Now you hear me:  The issue is that, let's say, a record label has 10,000 songs on Spotify from 10,000 artists.  And let's say each song gets one stream.  The label earns 10,000 streams * 0.00006 cents per stream.  Great for the label, bad for the artist.

This is the issue.  The streams per click are so low, that the labels will push old music that they've already earned money from, using established artists that are popular, and milk the crap out of them, leaving new and emerging artists to wallow in despair, while getting fractions of a cent out of the deal.


&gt; apple isn't doing anything different by launching their own streaming service. their literally copying google play and spotify. except that it has no free tier.

Apple already has a streaming service, called iTunes Radio, and it is more popular than Spotify.  What they're trying to do is something different.  And they want to do it well, and right by every party involved.

&gt; apple still has to pay the record labels royalties in order to stream their music which is what every other streaming service is doing. 

Yes, but Apple wants to pay *more* in royalties, and have less reliance on ad revenue.  *They don't want to have to sell your personal information.*

There's absolutely zero social pressure (that I can see) for me to be an Apple customer or user.  The same wasn't true with MS (and still isn't, really).

let's look at the CPUs for iOS.. Apple is the sole one in the industry to actually become a full arm8 licensor. They don't just use off the shelf reference designs like their competitors. They merely license the instruction set, and totally custom entire their system on a chip. That's why they hold the patents.

Let's look at basic manufacturing.. It's Apple's engineers that usually design and invent entirely new methods of or improvements to their partners technology. 

Even something as basic as the wireless chips they used for cellular... APPLE was the one who invented the custom chips that gave LTE at half the electric use and with 3g, CDMA and GSM on the same chip.

For a while, Apple was using a controller chip they invented for their SSD drives, that gave double the performance of the standard completion. Did people praise their engineering talent? No. They bitched and demanded the industry standard instead.

why do you think the industry went on and on about how worthless touchscreen keyboards were when Apple introduced the iPhone? Because nobody else had bothered to create intricate sensing technology that made it useable.

Apple created a whole technology underneath that dynamically resizes your tap zones around the keys to make the most likely keys become larger zones while shrinking the zones of the less likely keys. That's how it makes the keyboard so much more accurate than the competition.

Apple invented and patented methods of bonding the sensors right to the glass that shrunk the thickness by half.

Apple on the new MacBooks invented totally new key press sensors that shrunk the space dramatically while also ending the lop sided tip of the key press, so they can give you 16% larger keys but far closer together.

In the new MacBook trackpads, they totally eliminated the movement, but invented an incredible tech that fools your hand into believing a 'click' is coming from pushing it down. They even made it understand 'deeper' presses by inventing a way of sensing the expansion of your skin on a minute level as you press, then press 'deeper'. Now a press can be a tap, a hard click, a deeper click.. All on a non moving surface you feel is moving!

We could talk about the incredible double banding seamless wireless tech they invented that can double your transfer speeds on AirPort Extreme..

The iPhone was insanely innovative and you're just flat-out wrong if you think otherwise. There's no room for debate. Everything about it was a new concept and changed everything:

- The giant touch screen that you primarily use your finger to interact with. Everyone else was using a stylus, if a touch screen at all.
- Buttonless (beyond the home button) for a phone. People on the Internet freaked out and claimed they'll cling to their Nokia phones. Microsoft's CEO literally laughed at the lack of a physical keyboard. Other phone manufacturers advertised physical keyboards *as a feature* for several years after the iPhone launched. They're all gone or making Android phones now.
- Using the buttonless interface for more screen real-estate which allowed them a chance for a great portable web browser, being able to reasonably watch videos, etc. No one else was doing this or on track to do this, [just look at Android prototypes before iPhone was revealed](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/14/exclusive-android-docs-reveal-before-iphone-googles-plan-was-a-java-button-phone).
- Pinch-to-zoom. Using two fingers to very seamlessly perform an operation that was otherwise sloppy and confusing. Zooming in on a photo of someone's face is so easy with this interface. No one else was doing this. Everyone else had + and - buttons that zoomed into the middle of the screen.
- So many other small things that Apple had to figure out once they put all these things together: Slide-to-unlock so you don't accidentally turn the phone on and waste battery life, a sensor to turn the screen off when it's against your face so you don't accidentally press something, a gyroscope to rotate the screen based on your orientation, visual voice messages, etc., etc.

I hate to get into these arguments because people seem so passionate for/against Apple, but they put out easily the most innovative and influential product of the last decade by a mile.

Really? The first things I see in google about it are Apple's website and its Github page. In fact, I don't see the verge article in the search results at all!

The verge article is also a load of shit. Their biggest problem with it seems to be that a kid can lie about their age to be able to take part in the study. Now, if that makes ResearchKit evil, do they think that the internet should be purged of all porn, gambling, or alcohol-related websites as well? After all, kids could lie about their ages and see them! Or even worse, send them some data!

&gt; perhaps if a user were to change her answer about her age, it might be wise to automatically require an ID photo for age verification.

Yeah, because there's no way a kid could take a picture of their parents drivers license or anything. It's a totally foolproof method! It's also totally safe to require someone to send in a picture of their photo ID, especially when the next paragraph is completely devoted to questioning wether or not ResearchKit is anonymous enough.

&gt; there doesn't appear to be anything stopping Merck or Pfizer from building an app using ResearchKit and submitting it to the App Store 

Submitting it to the app store and it being accepted into the app store are two completely different things. During the keynote, Apple said that users would have to give permission before their data gets sent anywhere. If someone submitted an app that didn't follow those guidelines, it'd get rejected. Simple as that.

It also goes into population bias. Yeah, I'm sure that a sample size of the 20 people the university students recruited are a *much* better representation of the population than the hundreds of thousands of smartphone users who'll take part in the study with their phones. They seem determined to blow up any conceivable problems with ResearchKit, despite those problems already existing (and being much more prominent) in the kinds of research we already do.

Now, onto Apple supposedly killing off Open Source projects left, right, and centre. From the very first paragraph on your second link:

&gt; The core of FoundationDB was closed source

And that's the part that Apple bought and made private. Like it says in the article, if it had really been open-source, people could have continued using a fork of it.

&gt; As Apple works toward a relaunch of its Beats Music streaming service, it&amp;#039;s reportedly pushing labels to kill off the free version of Spotify.

&gt; The Verge&amp;#039;s sources believe Apple is trying to create a more hospitable environment for a revamped version of Beats Music, which reportedly has well under 1 million subscribers in its current form.

&gt; Apple may be going after YouTube as well, The Verge claims, reportedly offering to pay Universal Music Group&amp;#039;s licensing fees if the label stopped allowing its music on the site.

Android on average has seen an update every 6-9 months, and it can take between a few weeks and 6 months for the most recent update to get pushed out to our phones (depending on what phone we have and how big the update is).

iOS has a yearly update that happens at the same time every year.

This process happens in private, so we can't see the months they spend going from code to an update ready to be pushed out. (Windows follows largely the same model, but they have a shorter, bumpier, history of updates).

If we look at how many updates have actually been pushed out to phones Android is way ahead in both number and speed. The difference is that we can see clearly the lag between when the code is ready and when the update is ready. We can also see the difference between how long it takes to get an update ready for different phones. With iOS, that all happens behind closed doors, so we just see the update pop up one day.

The Apple model makes us feel better, but the Android model gets more updates out faster. Given the number of articles that get written about Android updates, it seems that generally people, even people who are 'tech savvy, would prefer to feel better about their updates than to have more updates faster.",-6,0.0853710853711,0.197228448739,0.380877305877,0.111207610158,0.75,0.375,335,0.0,25.7692307692,0.0111111111111,0.347222222222

300,"This is a fascinating issue that is as much about software and technology as it is about a business vision. 

Apple designed the ""whole product"" (i.e. software, hardware, upgrade policy etc) whereas Google took the ""partial solution"" approach (i.e. only the mobile OS and ignoring the other aspects that impact software usage and user experience).

301,"&gt;When Android says ""the update is ready X day"" - often only a handful of devices will receive it that day

Actually, zero devices will get it that day. When the updates to AOSP are ready, Google works with their hardware partners who made nexus devices to get the latest version ready to push out. There's usually a new Nexus device that was the development platform for the new version, and that device is usually ready almost immediately, and depending on hardware other devices might be ready very quickly too. Once it's ready they announce that the update is ready and push out the update. At that point other OEMs start the same process, which can take weeks or months.

&gt;When apple says ""the update is ready X day"", EVERY I device is going to get that update that day.

But the whole point I was making is that there's another milestone that happens months before this, that we never see. It's the point where the code is ready for the current device that Apple will be releasing in the fall, but they have finished optimizing the OS for all the other phones they're going to push it out to. That process can take a long time, but we never see it.

My point is that if Apple's goal was to push out updates as soon as they were ready, then in a few months this is what the process would look like:

1. We'd see iOS 9 get pushed out to the iPhone 6, and shortly after get pushed out to the 6 plus
2. Over the next month or two, updates would get pushed out to the 5c and 5s
3. Maybe the 5 or 4S would get the update too? The cutoff for updates is probably around there for iOS 9. If they get it, these would probably be the last to get it, and it would undoubtedly be missing some features.
4. The iPhone 6S and 6S plus launch with iOS 9.

The percent of devices updated within a single year would be better than Android, but the process would look very similar, some devices would get updated much sooner than others.

But Apple doesn't want the people with the 5 to feel bad, and they don't want people buying the 6S to get the update last, so instead they hold the updates for all the phones until the newest phone launches, and then they push it out to everyone at the same time.

And these became major points of contention between the two companies, whose relationship was already deteriorating for a variety of other reasons, including Apples concern that Google was gathering too much user data from the app.

So what happened was, Apple wanted Google Maps, but didn't want Google to do what they wanted with it. So Google gave them most of the app, but missing a key feature.

Rather than letting Google get their name on the app, Apple preferred to rip the entire thing out and replace it with their own crappy application.

Just because they didn't want their users to realize they were using a Google product.

Yeah, Google didn't capitulate, and in the end got what they wanted: a branded Google Maps app on iOS with all features.

Google is a gate keeper to the UX. They are solely responsible for the UX on Nexus devices and AOSP builds.

Imagine, if you will, a world where you have a box a legos. A box of legos so incredibly special that you are allowed to make a space ship, a wall, or even merely a box. That's Android. 

If you don't like Googles vanilla then HTC has strawberry. If you don't like HTCs then Samsung has sprinkles. God forbid you hate Samsung then LG has chocolate sauce for their UX.

Google does one thing exceptionally grand. Data. With Android they understood that not everyone wants to use their phone the same way as everyone else hence the UX being customizable. If you don't like a particular UX there's another manufacturer or even a ROM you can flash over to replace your current one.

As far as the money goes, Google obviously doesn't care about the money coming from Android. Google has a myriad of projects that never see consumer releases that they pour money and resources into. Nexus devices are consistently sold at a loss and Google doesn't charge licensing for Android. Flagship manufacturers (Samsung/LG/Motorola) are the ones that profit off Android. Where as Apple without money from iOS would have shut down hence being so desperately protective of their manufacturing rights.

There's no Intel sticker on a Macbook because Apple was so vehemently against using x86 for decades. Intel likely conceded that point when Apple was originally taking them in as a means to market share for Intel and either hasn't re-negotiated the contract or simply doesn't care.

394,"&gt; I'm worried where the trend is taking us.

We've already been there a decade.

First and most obviously - [printers](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/08/the-high-cost-of-wasted-printer-ink/index.htm). Of course, that's why Keurig tried it in the first place.

Second - phones and game consoles. Note that DRM here isn't protecting the content, but the control of the device. Apple isn't worried that jailbreaking will allow you to engage in copyright infringement; it's worried that you will do things with it outside of their development model and constraints, like - well, anything available on Cydia. The main feature that comes to mind is tethering, which is an [extremely simple feature to implement for free](http://www.wired.com/2010/07/apple-approves-pulls-flashlight-app-with-hidden-tethering-mode/), but which Apple would prefer that you purchase from your wireless provider.

Third - [3D printers](http://textually.org/3DPrinting/cat_add_category.html). We're really at a pivotal moment here, where 3D printing is becoming affordable enough for Home Depot and other mainstream stores to pick it up. Given the abundance of offerings, there's a danger of a printer manufacturer cutting a deal with a major 3D model provider as its exclusive source, and passing some of the licensing revenue to commercial vendors - with the result that the most widely-advertised and popularized 3D printer is also DRM-locked. Again, the point wouldn't be to prevent you from printing copied designs, but to *only* allow you to use designs that you purchased from approved vendors (at a markup, most likely).

So we really can't assume that Keurig's failure in this space will serve as a cautionary tale to other providers. There's still a huge financial incentive to slip this practice into products.

Before Apple came out with a GUI based fucking computer you know what we fucking had? we had fucking MS-DOS and if we wanted to launch a fucking game we had to fucking type out 75 letters and symbols in chin-fucking-eese. (Yes I know apple stole the GUI idea from xerox and steve jobs was a fuck-ass at times) Apple introduces an all-in-one simple fucking computer with a mouse and a GUI, un-fucking-heard-of at the time and everyone loses their shit and tries to build a competing product. The only fucking reason microsoft has such a fucking huge lead is they put their fucking OS on everything they could and the result? computers would crash pretty fucking often, and you would have to install drivers just to make sure your fucking mouse worked not to mention the build quality went out the fucking window. Fucking Apple kicks out steve jobs he founds NeXT, and fucking gives pixar money to get started. The result? CERN uses a NeXT computer to host the first web server/web page and basically starts the internet revolution. Pixar fucking creates a magical fucking tale in toy story, and pushes 3D Artistry to new fucking heights. Meanwhile at apple they fucking have the clone wars where apple licensed out their OS to everyone who wanted to build a MacOS computer and it was a fucking garbage user experience. Steve Jobs comes back and has Johnny Ive design the iMac, again for its time beautiful, and easy to use. No need for bullshit cables and 70 different port types for your keyboard your mouse and your monitor and your external CD Drive. And best of all it had color! Until then PC's were fucking beige ugly fucking pieces of fucking shit. Once the iMac comes out everyone again, loses their shit and tries to built competitors. (iPaq anyone?) And as a result they push design forward and PCs are actually nice to look at as well as functional. So Fuck you, for saying fuck you to the apple fan boys. Yes Apple computers are simple, and they just work.     
     
     
2. Gaming consoles might be holding back graphical and technical progress, but they also en-fucking-courage people to go out there and start developing games and they provide the bread-and-butter for most developers.

It took 1000 people five full years to develop that game. without console fucks to buy the previous games and give Rockstar (and its parent company) enough money to spend on development we wouldn't even fucking have it at all, or we might have a gimped version because developers are scared to fucking death of pirates.

443,"Why is that, because he claims Apple releasing a smart watch will help the category's public acceptance more than any company?

I think he's right for a couple reasons:

* Apple knows how to make a gadget ""cool"" towards non-techy people. No matter how dumb you think gold watches and celebrity endorsements are, that's what get the general public talking about your product, not ads like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8jsDWV8YpQ). You don't even need the actual product to be that good to reach massive mindshare when you have effective marketing/branding (see: Beats by Dre).

* The general public cares about new Apple products because they know odds are that they'll be a huge hit. Apple is one of the only companies who basically never release tons of new ideas simultaneously and let the market decide which one should survive or die. They also actually release new products they announce. The general public doesn't have enough time/interest to follow all new vaporware/abandonware tech out there, they'd rather follow what will likely actually take off, and statistically Apple just makes more sense to pay attention to.

* Public acceptance depends a lot on of many other people use said product. Most non-techy people don't want to be the only person using a new gadget by fear of looking dorky. They don't want to attract massive attention and get everyone talking/joking about their new gadget. This stops happening once said new product category is popular enough. Right now the Apple Watch is the only smartwatch with large sales, and at this pace it won't take too long before the ""dorky"" reputation falls.

Large sales lead to public acceptance which itself lead to even larger sales. It's a virtuous circle. There still needs to be an initial momentum to start the virtuous circle and Apple seems to be in the position to provide it. Also, it's not about the need, it's about the want.

453,"Infosec guy here.. Your description is a tad bit on the vague side but there's a couple of likely candidates for possible scams.

The 400$ purchase limit is a bit of a tipoff.  It's likely that this is a limit that might trigger a credit card fraud account freeze.  Credit card companies have certain ""triggers"" that will automatically freeze an account for ""suspicious activity"".  It's likely that someone figured out that this is the limit for whatever card is backing the Apple pay system.

The sneaky phone thing could be some kind of ID spoofing.  I think Apple pay works on NFC.  Phones with NFC capability (Samsung Galaxy S4 and up, Apple 5 and up) can generate any NFC signal.  

Basically the idea is that someone captures an NFC signal from a legitimate phone making a payment.  It then spoofs the same signal to pretend to be the other person's phone.  The scammer may have watched the person put in their pin and knows it or they might just try obvious ones until they find one that works.  (Try one phone with one pin... when it doesn't work, they try a phone with a known pin and try to make it so that you don't notice.  In this way they can brute force the pin number with small purchases.)


This is likely a twist on the chip and pin spoofing scam.  A couple years back, at Defcon, a couple of hackers went around scanning near people and collecting all of their RFID credit card signals.  They later did a presentation on the potential dangers of NFC and RFID technology... such as someone standing next to you being able to ""copy"" your credit card right through your pocket.  

If you walk up to someone in line at a store... put your phone near their pocket and can get a clear RFID reading, all you have to do is watch them put in their pin number.  When it's time for you to pay, you emulate the RFID signal using the phone, hold your [non RFID] card and your phone in the same hand when you ""tap"" the card, and then enter the pin you just shoulder-surfed.  (We don't use chip and pin in America but this something that's happening in Europe).

Next time you get a suspicious purchase, take the time to grab your manager and contact Apple or PayPal's fraud division with the relevant details of the purchase number, time, date, description of the person (or picture).  This way if a fraudulent charge is reported, they can cross reference it in their data and might actually catch them.

&gt; With a large-screened iOS device available, consumers have turned away in huge numbers from high-end Android manufacturers like Samsung, with devastating results: The South Korean smartphone company&amp;#039;s profits cratered, with Apple now taking 93% of all profits in the entire smartphone industry.

&gt; Historically, no foreign smartphone company has ever seen sales in the country of higher than 15%. In November 2014, Apple hit 33%, and has likely overtaken Samsung by now.

462,"This is something of a misnomer. 

Story time: as graphics cards become more powerful, resolution increases. Once resolution increases to the current highest standard then Nvidia and AMD start ramping up the power to support multiple monitors at that resolution from a single card. After that is stabilized then they work towards clock speeds, memory performance, etc. 

Typically when new tech breakthroughs are achieved graphics cards quickly follow, once the graphics cards can support these new standards then monitor companies will start producing them to those new standards, and since TVs and Monitors share a lot of common tech these days you get 4k TVs and monitors typically around the same time. 

Next comes mobile devices, usually around the time graphics companies figure out how to support multiple monitors on a single chip set, they can also shrink it down to support that resolution on a single / smaller display (phone/tablet)

Currently phones are coming in 720p, 1080p, and there's about half a dozen 4k phones the last time I checked (including overseas models)

Traditional Monitors are supporting Full HD (FHD) 1080p, and Quad/Ultra HD (QHD/UHD) which is 4k or thereabouts. We skipped right over 2k cinema and will jump into 8k by the next Olympics (some cameras already shoot 8k and 9k like RED)

Apple is putting 5k into their iMacs


Now that being said, larger resolution allows for more pixels. More pixels means more content onscreen at once and a larger amount of detail. However, things like fonts and icons for typical computer and phone usage are a set number of
 pixels. If you cram a higher resolution into the same size screen then everything gets smaller - which doesn't make for very good usage because then you have to scale everything to compensate. 


TL;DR: phones currently max out at 4k while cameras and a couple super high end TVs max out at 8-9k. Unless you are using a much bigger screen higher resolution just shrinks everything down and your eye can't tell a huge difference up close (using monitors)",5,0.0955193270087,0.168461549029,0.393403948298,0.230618564663,0.566666666667,0.75,344,0.0221238938053,28.6666666667,0.157142857143,0.307142857143

&gt; Apple&amp;#039;s iPhone, since the inception of iOS 8, has been fitted with a security setting that means when an iPhone is returned to factory settings it cannot be reactivated with another Apple user account without the express permission of the original owner.

&gt; Apple has not implemented a similar system for the Apple Watch, which is priced upwards of &amp;pound;300 and can cost considerably more than an iPhone.

&gt; The Apple Watch can only be used when paired with an iPhone, and needs an Apple user account and internet access to register with an iPhone before it can even be used to tell the time.

Honestly, there's probably at best a 50/50 chance if you pick a random person off the street that they'll know 1080p refers to the number of vertical pixels on the screen.

The only thing that matters when marketing to the general public is recognition and overall aesthetics of the name. At a point it becomes far now information than most people want or understand. If everyone sees a 4k or UHD TV then they'll know what it looks like and it's far easier and looks much better to call it 4k instead of 2160p.

501,"That's a simple/straightforward question,.. that unfortunately doesn't have an easy or short answer. 

What I usually tell people is:.... ""There isn't any 1 major/obvious thing that makes Apple products ""worth it"" ... but rather a combination of 100's or 1000's of tiny things -- most of which you're never gonna notice (from the outside) unless you actually use an Apple product for some length of time. (I think this is why people scoff and doubt looking at it from the outside,.. because it all just seems like ""shiny fluff that isn't worth the money"". That's all they see,. because they don't spend any time digging into it and understanding it. 

What I notice most when using an Apple product.. is the attention to tiny details. You can tell.. whether looking at the hardware, software, OS,etc.. that the people who built it actually fucking cared. Even little tiny details deep inside the OS or hardware-design elements deep inside the body/chassis (that nobody will ever see).. somebody still cared enough to ""do it right"". 

**on the Hardware side:..**

* great Trackpads
* magnetic features (like the MagSafe power cord or the magnet that keeps the lid closed
* Aluminum unibody (strong, rigid, survivable)
* but most of all .. just the great overall build-quality. You can just tell looking at it,.. that someone fucking cared about designing it right. 
* You're never gonna pick up an Apple product and say:.. ""Well,.. 90% of it is great,. but this one sub-component is totally cheap/chintzy and failed 1 week into me owning it."" 

**on the Software/OS side:...**

* it's built on a good solid UNIX foundation.. so any/all benefits you like about UNIX/Linux are already there. Solid. Stable. Lots of open-source plugins. Compartmentalized data-silos that separate OS from Apps from User-data (for great security and modularity when doing Backups/Restores,etc) 

* for me.. one of the big things about using OSX.. is that it feels like it ""fades into the background"" and gets out of my way. I don't get that same feeling from Windows or Linux,etc. Other OSes feel like they need constant baby-sitting and fiddling and tweaking just to get them to work. OSX isn't like that. I'm constantly finding little features of the OS and catch myself saying: ""Fuck.. now THATS how a computer should work!"".. 

**on the Cloud/Integration side:..**

* Apple's ecosystem is really polished and tightly integrated. There's uniformity throughout everything they do. It doesn't really matter what combination of Apple products you buy.. they're gonna work together seamlessly. 

Apple is great about all the things they do,.. because they control everything ""end-to-end"". Some people bash on Apple for that ""walled garden"".. but that structure also means they can create/provide a consistent, unified and amazing end-user experience across all of their devices/software/OSes,etc. There really is no other company that does that (at least not as well as Apple does). 

So are Apple products expensive?.. Sure.. they cost more upfront,.. but you also get a pretty deep and consistently high-quality and comprehensive solution out of it. (that keeps getting better,.. the deeper you get into it). 

And on top of all that,.. Apple products typically have pretty great re-sale value.

ATT nearly destroyed their business in the process due to the massive bandwidth requirements of the iPhone compared to the rest of mobile hardware portfolio.  

Android and BlackBerry were playing in the old world, working with the carriers, etc and now they're still caught in parts of that world, even a decade later.

I'd be interested to learn if the BB MDM is anywhere near Airwatch (or MobileIron or other solutions) 

That's a good question. I haven't worked with BES (or, anything MDM) since the Pearl 8100 came out in ...googles... 2006. I just meant that the fact that they had a BES didn't, by default, require them to have BlackBerry phones. I've seen the physical durability of the hardware be a larger factor. I swear, every time a work BlackBerry comes into my store, it is a Bold 9650 from five years ago. They hate it. Well, of course. Your BES admin probably neutered it as much as he possibly could, and it is five year old hardware.

How many of those are just apps, though? Apps are apps are apps. They could have been easily implemented and distributed on anything. They would have gotten slower with every OTA update on Android, but they still could have been released. I just see too much ""old Apple"" in iOS today.

Or are you concerned because now we have five dealerships selling the same makes all buying ad space, and this would reduce it to just one purchaser of ad space per make? For me to consider *that* a valid concern, I'd want to see some verified numbers that show that gross local ad revenues shrink when you have direct sale vs. multiple middle men. 

In addition I'm not sure local advertising is as big a stimulus to the local economy as your making it to be.

As for the rest, wouldn't an OEM direct sale store hire locals? My Local Apple store isn't exactly shipping in H1-B visa employees from Bangalore, they hire locals. Those locals by the way, spend their paychecks, you know, locally.

I think your entire line of thinking is faulty, because as many users here point out, this is not a business model that is *forced* in any other industry. I'm curious as to why only when it comes to sales of personal transportation vehicles this model is so rigoursly touted as the only way to protect the locals from the big bad companies.

Also if this model *is* so effective at protecting consumers, then why don't we force it's adoption in every other industry? That is an actual question by the way.

So my premise is this, can you provide compelling evidence that banning direct OEM sales benefits the consumers and local economies in a way that is not offset by the fact that manufacturers can generally sell their own products for less then a middle man can?

So in this case, in the US at least, the 3 letter agencies and politicians are ""having a bad day"" when it comes to encryption and spying on citizens. So as encryption is getting stronger and stronger and the citizens are opening their eyes and using encryption more and more, the 3 letter agencies are probably having a harder time spying. They need to stop this encryption from spreading. Remember all the squealing they did about Apple encrypting their phones? Didn't they bring up, ""it is for the children"" argument? They didn't squeal too much when Google said they would encrypt Android phones. The politicians heard us and Apple loud and clear when it came to the Apple phone encryption whining. 

Now, how do you think American citizens would react if the Government required a permit to send encrypted mail? Or if the banks needed a permit to have ssl on their websites or you needed the permit to do online banking? Or how about the stay at home mom blog that wanted ssl and she had to get a permit? Or how about the battered wife support website that wanted to use ssl for their forums and the batterer works for the Government? Or if you have a political website of the opposite party? How would that go over? What if you had to give the Government a set of keys to your encryption?

Most Americans would probably roll over and take it, ""it is for the children"" or something silly like that will be said. Many would scream and yell. Enough would scream and yell that the politicians would be scared of not being re-elected.

First HTC was the Android leader, then it was Motorola, But with the Galaxy S Samsung became the new star, and with the S2 their domination was insane. It  was the first to sell comparably to iPhone, and everyone else struggled to even make a profit. It would be insane to expect Samsung to keep a similar lead on Galaxy S(n) alone, the competition even from Samsung's own line is stronger, with the Note as the more accepted high end phone now, but also cheaper phones that are just as good except for maybe a couple of details that are pointless anyway to many people.


HTC has made a strong comeback with some pretty cool phones, doing what they traditionally did well, but taking it up an extra notch, LG has managed to make their G series pretty attractive, without resorting to some buzz phenomenon as they used to. Competition from China is increasing too, and they are both ambitious and capable and are pushing boundaries even more than Samsung or anybody else in making thinner more powerful phones.

&gt;Hence why apple is literally the most successful company on the entire planet.

Depends upon how you deem success. I don't qualify ripping people off wholesale as a success measure.

What's with all that money if they are not there consistently providing tech solutions for the long term so one can depend upon them?

Slows down the hardware performance a great deal.

The only OS X upgrade that was actually faster than the previous one was 10.6, all the others are slower intentionally to increase the hardware turnover rate.

Such things don't occur as often on Windows upgrades and certainly not annually like it does on OS X.

Windows upgrades are optional (until 10 years) and occur every 3-5 years or so. OS X upgrades are annual and mandatory after 3 years or no security updates.

So in terms of reliability, ease of use for slow learners/newbies, constancy and cost effectiveness, Windows rocks.

Windows security is just as good or even better than OS X is now. So malware of XP days (a OS not designed for the Internet)is a mute factor.

Ultimately, you know a law is bad when it doesn't apply equally to everyone. I always like to say that if it doesn't apply to those in power as well (or the rich), then the law *should not exist*. Take the drug laws. They always seem to affect the poorest of the people the most, yet actors or other rich people get to go to ""stress clinics"" when caught. If drugs are so terrible they need harsh punishments then why don't they apply equally to everyone?

But returning to this issue, this treaty not only *allows* the NSA (and the rest of the Five Eyes nations) to keep buying zero-days from those same ""evil hackers"" the the treaty is meant to stop, but it actually *forces* good security researchers to share their zero-days exploits with the NSA (kind of how [Apple](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/12/obama-to-sign-executive-order-on-cybersecurity-threats/) has agreed to do recently voluntarily and how Microsoft has been doing it for a [long time](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms)), so the NSA can exploit them themselves. So from the get-go the treaty is a *farce*.

Also, here's another strong argument for why this shouldn't pass. It wants to stop hackers from selling exploits to China but give them to the US, right? That creates a terrible incentive for the US in terms of (actual) cyber-security. 

The US already barely cares about ""cyber-security"", despite its claims and chest-beating that it does. What it really means is it cares about passing new surveillance laws and new ways to hack people's computers. That's not cyber-security.

But as long as China and others keep attacking your bad security defense, it will have no choice but to *start caring* about security defense as well. And it has already started doing that lately, by starting to switch all federal websites to HTTPS for instance.

Now, if this treaty passes, then the US will feel once again too comfortable for its own good in terms of security defense.

Good change is good, but too much change/stupid change and change for the sake of change is bad.

&gt; however iOS and OSX have remained backwards compatible throughout

Nope, only OS X 10.6 had Rosetta to run legacy PPC programs, then only for 4 years before it was allowed to lapse for security pupates. 10.7 and up don't run PPC, there was a HUGE outcry when that occurred, Apple didn't even inform anyone their PPC software wouldn't work. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people reverted back to 10.6 in a matter of a few days, it was madness an chaos online and in the Apple Stores with angry people.

Windows 7 Pro will run XP programs, a 13 year old operating system and Windows 7 is still getting security updates until 2020, 10 years of support. 

So essentially one can run XP programs for nearly 20 years.

&gt;I want choice too, but when all other choices are utter shit I just want something that works. I've been burned too many times by incompatibility

There is more software for Windows and more hardware choices and more compatibility with file formats for it than any other operating system in the world. It's why Apple finally had to allow Windows on it's hardware. Any 3D gamer will tell you that. Apple tries to lock one into their own file formats so people will have to buy another Mac to access their files.

Does Apple allow LibreOffice on the app store? No, because to keep them out Apple demands all appstore programs be copy protected, and DRMed programs is contrary to open source code philosophy which people are allowed to improve on it themselves if they wish.

&gt;iOS and OSX are, like Android, built on the superior technology that is a unix-based OS.

[It's not secure if it's in a constant state of change as that introduces more flaws from the new/changed code segments. So that negates the Unix/Linux permissions, which is mute now because Windows also uses permissions. See this chart and be SHOCKED!](http://www.gfi.com/blog/most-vulnerable-operating-systems-and-applications-in-2014/)

&gt;It's all free and you can just wait until you think its safe to upgrade

It's not a matter of being free, but being secure. OS X is never really secure because it's always changing and not allowed to harden. A free operating system is nothing if it bricks a $3000 piece of hardware, which is very possible on a Mac due to the boot ROMs.

&gt;Right.

Your trying to convince me to go Apple?

I'm a ex-near 30 year user of Apple's Mac's and now have found blessed relief in the stability, steadfastness and security of Windows.

It may suck here and there, but it's a lot better off than the Stockholm Syndrome Effect of erratic change that occurs on Apple hardware.

You should seriously give Windows 10 a try when it comes out. Windows 7 was great also, but Win 8/8.1 was a abortion, but at least Microsoft knows it and attempting to fix it. Apple you just have to put up with what they do at every upgrade or be denied security updates. 

Apple never listens to it's customers, they think what they do is always best and you just have to put up with it.

Well no more.

Done.

As a mechanical designer, I don't bother patenting anything I invent. The amount of time, effort and money I'd put into a) securing the patent and b) defending the patent would vastly overwhelm the work I could put into just making a better product that people would willingly prefer should any competition steal the idea and produce it for less.

Maybe it works for medium sized companies, maybe not. It does seem like the big Apple / Samsung (etc.) battles are mostly money-fueled big dick competitions rather than actual protection of intellectual property. Neither of them *really* cares if a phone is a rectangle or not, but there's value in forcing the hand and fighting it out.

682,"&gt; It appears you missed the Apple Versus everyone lawsuits of phone patents which very much included Wi-Fi patents.

First, I think you mean ""everyone v. Apple"" litigation - or even more accurately: ""patentee v. a bunch of tech companies including Apple"" litigation - like these:

[Apple loses $24m patent lawsuit to pager firm ](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/19/apple-loses-24m-patent-lawsuit-to-pager-firm)

[Apple didn't violate wireless tech patents, jury finds](http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-not-violating-wireless-technology-patents-jury-says/)

Second, not all ""wireless communication"" is Wi-Fi. Often, Wi-Fi products get dragged in as just one form (albeit the most prominent) of wireless communication. Some of the older patents aren't even centrally focused on Wi-Fi - they cover things like pagers / Bluetooth / generic RF, but Wi-Fi products happen to utilize the same technology.

Third - these lawsuits really aren't among members of the community, but are between an outsider (sometimes a patent troll) and members of the Wi-Fi Alliance.

5. Instant comparison with other people who donated more. (buffet and gates incoming?)
3. Blaming Apple for having made all that money through overpriced products. (perhaps with a price comparison to other brands/companies, who of course would love to be able to charge as much as Apple)

That doesn't only mean no data, at the time it also meant no phone calls, either (sometimes not even 911). So, they took away the unlimited plans, because holy shit, and reinstated overages. Why?Supply and demand. If the demand for your product is too high for you to be able to meet, reduce demand by raising prices.

&gt; Once you accept that Apple is developing in-car intelligence, then it would be foolish to imagine it will not seek to apply this intelligence in other fields, such as self-healing machines, robotics and A.I., augmented services and automation.

&gt; When it comes to A.I., it seems pretty clear that Apple has assembled much of what it needs to achieve rapid progress in the development and deployment of increasingly sophisticated cloud-based artificial intelligence across its growing line of products in the coming years.

&gt; Apple is aware of these concerns: Apple board member Andrea Jung serves on the Committee for Economic Development, which only last month warned that this new wave of automation could seriously impact employment and further polarize wealth inequality.

I'm afraid this ship has sailed and now everyone thinks this is gospel, but this phrase is a pretty big generalization. Sometimes it applies to bad behaviors and sometimes to benign ones. 

I think it hinges on how careful a company is with your identity. 

This VPN example shows an example of a company's literally selling data about a person that can be tracked back to you. That's really not good.

However, people will also say that companies like Spotify or Google make you ""the product"" when you use their free services. 

In those cases, you're ""the product"" in the same way you're ""the product"" when you drive down there street and see billboards. 

Companies like Spotify and Google don't sell *you*, they sell advertisers on access to your field of view. They don't sell your data or identity. Rather, they use data points to show you ads you might care about. 

Apple goes about it differently: they use free services to lock your into iOS and keep you on the platform.

713,"Okay so first this is speculation, I'm not aware of the specifics about how this happened or browser apis - but my first thought is to do with Chrome native app apis. 

First, you mentioned Google and I agree Chrome is the most likely to have this issue, but it's worth noting there was also eg a Firefox add on they could be referring to. 

But in general, I think Chrome could have APIs that make this happen. Chrome has cross platform native style apps - eg chrome apps/extensions that appear as normal apps on your system and can be found in the start menu etc. For example I think Evernote have one. They can run independently of Chrome and continue running if you're not using Chrome. 

My suspicion is that Hola are using an API similar to that to spin off a process independently of Chrome from their extension, which Chrome treats as native and allows Windows/the main OS to manage. They'd be doing this at Chrome startup or as soon as they're enabled, allowing their process to stay around if you close chrome and allowing it to be ignored by Chrome when you ask it to disable their extension. 

So if that is the case it becomes a bit tricker to answer is this Google's fault than if it was a security hole (and as a reminder, this is speculation - it absolutely could be) in the browser. I mean yes it is sure, but they probably have legitimate reason to have that API. They want Chrome to enable cross platform native apps built with Web technologies - so they have APIs way outside a normal browser extension platform. 

On your second question, I don't see anywhere the buck can really stop other than Google - I assume Apple police their extension library since there was no Hola add on for Safari. But the extent you blame Google will be the extent you want that sort of policing - it's the same argument as Google Play/App Store.
