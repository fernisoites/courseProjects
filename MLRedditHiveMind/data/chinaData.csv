It may or may not work well in other areas but again, ur standard of ""well"" may be different from others. Don't throw in more arguments like human rights. Legalizing any substance is and still currently viewed as not acceptable for most countries (you said so as well).

Okay, lets get into pointing out how your mix and match refuting my argument is bullshit shall we.  China is a military dictatorship in the guise of socialist capitalism, not a communist state regardless of what the claim.  Considering we are arguing the validity and morality of the death penalty, China's lack of respect for human rights is most certainly valid.  

Speaking of China, they have been regularly reducing the number of crimes punishable by death and they have also been consistently dropping the number of executions they conduct.  

My use of communism was to point out that *although* a system may look good in theory, the practical application is shit.  It was not to discuss whether communism has been successful anywhere or not.  SPOILER:  Communism has never worked in practice.  Not once.  Even Soviet Russia was never at any point in its existence a communism.  It was again a dictatorship that utilised socialist principles to govern the masses.

&gt;But whatever, u are again throwing new subjects in the discussion. 

Your difficulty at keeping up with the arguments presented and how they are all related is not really my problem.  I have offered to assist in you comprehending what I am saying and you chose to laugh that off.  If you cannot be polite and see that I was being genuine, itu salah kamu bukan salah aku.

&gt;You are confusing at most times

Again, not my problem.  I am speaking very concise and well structured English.  You wanted to get into this debate.  I agreed that Australia's policy towards drugs is not progressive and provided much evidence that prohibition does not work.

This was highlighted to show you that the Indonesian system instituting the death penalty for possession and trafficking of drugs is ridiculous, because there is a lot of evidence to show that prohibition of substances *in itself* is a stupid policy.

Now if you are talking my argument regarded *more progressive nations*, then yes, most of Europe and Australia are far more progressive than Indonesia both politically and legally.  The reasons for this are many and varied, as Indonesia is a complex nation.

&gt;That is in one fucking response dude. Be consistent, even when u lie, be consistent. Hehehhee

I provided you with extensive links and evidence resulting from thorough research that this is the case.  I am tired of being polite, so if you are too fucking stupid or too fucking blind to understand the facts placed in front of you, then you are one of the problems with this world.  Your ridiculous one eyed bullshit exacerbates conflict and social issues, and worst of all *you aren't even willing to learn!*. Grow up man.

&gt;What u are agreeing to is ""an eye for an eye"" principle.

See now you're being disingenuous again.  It is hypocritical of a government that is willing to execute foreign nationals to request clemency for it's own citizens.  I am not agreeing with an eye for an eye principle at all. 

I am *talking* about the hypocrisy of this act and the rightful calls of the nations that do not participate in this unjust practice for clemency of their own nationals.  No country has requested a pardon, they agree with the arrest and detention of their nationals, but they in principle do not agree with the death penalty. 

If 140+ nations do not practice the death penalty, it is the majority of the planet that disagrees with the death penalty.  So yes, nations that still implement capital punishment should be judged harshly and condemned for their actions. 

&gt;Is it unjust during the trial or the former issues?

This makes no sense.

&gt;U think i don't understand English? Lol...wow...as a so-called person who deals with legal matters regularly, I am truly disappointed at ur level of arguments and assumptions. What actually do u do if i may ask?

You may definitely not ask.  I assume as such because if you can understand English well enough to comprehend what I am telling you, you would not say half of the rubbish that you have been spouting.  Taking one out of context and willfully misrepresenting what they are trying to say is an indication of one clutching at straws.

If your language comprehension is *good* then you wouldn't be so ridiculous and hyperbolic with the rubbish that you're saying and trying to obfuscate the argument.

And ffs learn some basic Reddit formatting, such as quoting, so your the mess that you spew forth onto your keyboard is somewhat readable.

Yes, rightfully so. If the US gets criticized, it's usually deserved. If the US gets criticized and a US-critical post makes the frontpage, it usually means that the US has committed such horrendous and undeniably crimes not even the apologists can downvote it quickly enough to censor that information from spreading to the general population.

The problem is: There are countless of people defending the US on this site. Even the most heinous crimes like torture. In every thread you will see apologists and they will be upvoted. Every looked at threads critical of China or Russia? 

Even blatant lies and misrepresentations about Russia and China get upvoted. Apologists in the related threads often get heavily downvoted, even when they provide citations.

Things are the worst when it comes to problems like pollution where reddit is one of the most biased sites in the world. Americans actually believe China is a worse polluter than the US, for example. Usually desperately clinging to absolute numbers of pollution.

That's a massive problem: China could produce 3 times as much as pollution and people still couldn't complain because they would still pollute less than Americans or Canadians.

It's Americans and Canadians and Australians who have to cut back on pollution, as they have a significantly higher potential for mitigation of their pollution.

I didn't avoid anything.

I ignored your comment about China's water pollution as you have provided zero comparison to other nations.

&gt;and went straight to very specific examples of per-capita pollution levels in China

These aren't specific at all. These are general greenhouse gas emissions statistics of countries, allowing a direct comparison between China and others.

Your water pollution example is extremely specific, though. Why did you choose that overly specific piece of information.

&gt;Why won't you comment on China's water pollution epidemic?

Because we are currently comparing pollution in different countries and China being polluted in one specific way doesn't make China a worse polluter than others.

Why won't you comment on the fact that the US is a worse polluter than China?

&gt;Plus, having things like 30 million people living in caves, some 10% of the US's population helps inflate those ""energy efficiency numbers"" as you can dump China's massive peasant population 47% live in rural villages and farms into their urban populations to really make their numbers impressive, but it only paints a misleading picture at best. 

Except it doesn't. These people are actually contributing *negatively* to energy efficiency. Meaning that if they wouldn't live in caves and wouldn't rely on subsistence farming but adapt to more efficient and effective modes of living instead, the country would be even more efficient.

91,"I just checked your facts on this because this seemed to be drastically against the grain of everything else I know about sustainable fishing.  I'm presenting the stats of the articles I found and nothing more, which both agree and disagree with you.  I think the issue here is that the impact of fishing krill is not at all fleshed out, and not whether we are very far or not from the amount that will cause reproductive failure of the population.

__

Scientists believe krill have declined by 80 per cent since the 1970s, and the most likely cause is global warming. There is uncertainty, though, about the remaining population: the BAS estimates 100 million tonnes; krill harvesting companies claim about 400-500 million tonnes. Under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the annual allowed krill catch in the Southern Ocean is 4 million tonnes. But until now there has been 'huge under-fishing', usually less than 20 per cent of that quota, said Tarling. [SOURCE](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/23/fishing.food)    

__

As the PEW Environment Group commented in 2010: how can you certify a single operator or a few ships if you want to guarantee the sustainability of an entire fishery? If a few ships are acting responsibly, but the vast majority are not, the target population could still be at risk of being overfished. Aker BioMarine boasts of a no-by-catch policy, but some scientists are deeply worried about the by-catch of larval fish. The existing data on Krill abundance, reproductive strategies, life history and population variables are meager. No management regime or eco certification scheme can capture these uncertainties and indeterminacies adequately in their models so the claim of sustainability and the management tools are built on a shaky foundation. The impact of long-term environmental change is also difficult to incorporate in these models. The growing Krill fishing industry is adding to the pressure of environmental changes that are already threatening Krill. Human-forced climate change being the most prominent. Krill larvae feed on micro-algae living on the bottom of sea ice where a small layer of melt water forms a nursery. Adult Krill will overwinter there as well. The winter sea ice cover is rapidly dwindling around the Antarctic Peninsula, which has the fastest rising temperatures of the planet, 2.5 degrees C in the last 50 years.

Reproductive failure in Krill as a result of dwindling sea ice is a real risk and will result in breeding failure in birds and seals. Some of these effects are already visible. According to one 2004 estimate, based on data covering 40 Antarctic summers, the amount of Krill in the Southern Ocean may have dropped by 80% since the 1970s. This makes the MSC health of stock assessment questionable to say the least.[SOURCE](http://www.seashepherd.org/commentary-and-editorials/2013/04/16/krill-fisheries-the-next-collapse-605)

One issue for debate will be the CCAMLR's annual catch limit of 3.47 million tonnes in the Atlantic-bordering section of the Southern Ocean, the main fishing ground for Antarctic krill. ""Current krill management fails to take account of the subtleties of the ecosystem,"" says Volker Siegel, a marine biologist at the Institute for Sea Fisheries in Hamburg, Germany, and member of the European Union's CCAMLR delegation. Siegel says that rather than setting an ocean-wide limit, krill fisheries should be regulated on a smaller scale, because much of the fishing is limited to a few sites.

Another worry is the number of fishing vessels being deployed in the Southern Ocean. Norway is now operating three ships, for example, and China is expected to rapidly increase its krill fishing after sending its first vessel this year. ""If China starts fishing in a big way, catch will expand rapidly, outstripping our ability to orderly manage it,"" says Steve Nicol, a marine ecologist with the Australian Antarctic Division in Kingston, Tasmania, who advises the Australian government on krill fisheries.[SOURCE](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100901/full/467015a.html)",50,-0.0144099378882,0.22712372032,0.370988612836,0.298316254667,1.1,1.0,643,0.073417721519,22.1724137931,0.075,0.366666666667

I note in my other comment that China has always been diplomatic in settling territorial disputes. Now, maritime disputes are another thing due to the strategic location of the SCS and Diaoyutai/Senkaku, but I'm pretty sure none of the military outposts by the aforementioned countries have eliminated the possibility of diplomacy. In fact, the ASEAN refusal to outright condemn China's actions is proof that the various nations within ASEAN have differences in opinion about this.

&gt;*The US is really the only force in the world that can force the Chinese to sit down and discuss these issues without resorting to purely military means to settle them.*

The US was not involved in any way regarding the 17 of 23 territorial disputes China has settled with its neighbours (Russia and the -stans). Of the two remaining land disputes with India and Bhutan, one might argue the Indian assumption of US military support is a factor in why the disputes are still unsettled.

Judging by China's past history, they are far more likely to work with their neighbours than to outright subjugate them (see: China treating its neighbours as symbolically tributary states).

After World War II the US made the logical decision that no other super power has ever made when put into a similar situation. We decided against expanding our power through conquest and land grabbing. In fact, we actually lost land. We gave the Philippines their independence.

Our alliances give us the opportunity to have military bases in countries across the entire planet without having to fight to hold a frontier like the empires of old did. Our aircraft carriers provide a similar role as well. And because of how advanced our military is, we can be anywhere almost immediately.

The world lives in Pax Americana right now, and while China might seem like an up and comer, they are **FAR** from actually being anywhere near out level.

What is wrong with Shell Oil committing corporate espionage against the Nigerian government?

&gt;who cares?

The US, NATO, the West, China, India, basically everyone.

On a similar but related topic, nobody wants the US' actions outed. Once they're outed everyone has to denounce and hoot and holler, but secretly they're sad. They want the intelligence. They want the interference. They want the US to spend trillions on defense so that no one else has to spend anywhere near as much.

&gt;I think China have a better chance of getting humanity off this planet than the US

Nope.

&gt;Their culture respects advanced education in a way that Western culture once did but certainly does not any longer.

Nope. Their culture respects the idea of the degree as a symbol of attainment and the potential for advancement, but they don't respect creative thought and they respect the idea of cheating wherever possible. This creates a class of people with a high level of perceived attainment, but without the actual ability to contribute in these fields. They can emulate the US, but you won't see the real type of ground breaking research you see coming out of the US and Europe for another 20+ years, if ever.

Just because 250 million Americans don't respect educational attainment, or our pop culture makes fun of it, doesn't mean the smartest people aren't going to amazing schools and doing amazing work once they graduate. When was the last time we had a President who wasn't highly educated? Reagan?

I don't know what circles you run in, but my friends all value education enormously.

The US is doing it through private venture.

The US did win the Vietnam War. The strategic objective was to deny the USSR a quick victory in converting Vietnam to Communism. Vietnam was economically destroyed and took decades to recover.

181,"Erdogan is an authoritarian islamist 

&gt;Throughout his leadership, beginning with his election to prime minister in 2003, Erdogan has restructured the formerly-secular education system overseeing the growth of imam hatip, or religious training schools, throughout the country. According to the Financial Times, such schools boasted 63,000 students in 2002-2003; by 2014, the number of imam hatip students had exploded to 983,000.

&gt;What makes this particularly disturbing is the fact that tens, if not hundreds of thousands of these students never signed up for imam hatips to begin with. Rather, Erdogan systematically reshaped existing secular public schools and redesigned the student examination system so that thousands of children are assigned to imam hatips even against their will.

&gt;But he hasn't stopped there. As of a year ago, all public schools also provide mandatory ""religious culture and ethics"" courses beginning at age nine. Yet despite a 2007 European Court of Human Rights ruling requiring education in all religions, human rights lawyer and columnist Orhan Kemal Cengiz writes in Al-Monitor, ""Sunni Islam continues to be imposed, with students required to memorize Islamic prayers and Quranic verses.""

&gt;He has sought to reverse the ban on head scarves in state institutions, called for a ""change of mindset"" in the judiciary,[5] embraced Hamas, and endorsed an Al-Qaeda financier.[6] He has sought to equate religious school education with that of secular schools,[7] and his political party has worked to enforce Islamic alcohol bans in some municipalities

&gt;Domestic commerce also was stimulated by the reform policies, which explicitly endeavored to enliven the economy by shifting the primary burden of the allocation of goods and services from the government plan to the market. **Private entrepreneurship and freemarket activities were legalized and encouraged in the 1980s, although the central authorities continuously had to fight the efforts of local government agencies to impose excessive taxes on independent merchants.** By 1987 the state-owned system of commercial agencies and retail outlets coexisted with a rapidly growing private and collectively owned system that competed with it vigorously, **providing a wider range of consumption choices for Chinese citizens than at any previous time.**

&gt;Although the reform program achieved impressive successes, it also gave rise to several serious problems. One problem was the challenge to party authority presented by the principles of freemarket activity and professional managerial autonomy. **Another difficulty was a wave of crime, corruption, andin the minds of many older peoplemoral deterioration caused by the looser economic and political climate. The most fundamental tensions were those created by the widening income disparities between the people who were ""getting rich"" and those who were not and by the pervasive threat of inflation.** These concerns played a role in the political struggle that culminated in party general secretary Hu Yaobang's forced resignation in 1987. Following Hu's resignation, the leadership engaged in an intense debate over the future course of the reforms and how to balance the need for efficiency and market incentives with the need for government guidance and control. The commitment to further reform was affirmed, but its pace, and the emphasis to be placed on macroeconomic and microeconomic levers, remained objects of caution.

In the late 1800s, California in particular started freaking out about Chinese immigrants, because they had a strong work ethic and did everything, no matter the job or the conditions.

The Chinese were discriminated against, and eventually the US moved to restrict immigration.  Chinese immigrants were also barred from naturalization because they were deemed ""unassimilatable"".

Eventually the restrictions got overturned in 1947, but then communism rose to power in China in 1949, and by then, the Red Scare was just about poised to go into full swing along with the Cold War, so forget about accepting the Chinese then.

According to the terms of the treaty, Taiwan and Penghu (isles between 119E-120E and 13N-14N) were to be ceded to Japan in perpetuity. Both governments were to send representatives to Taiwan immediately after signing to begin the transition process, which was to be completed in no more than two months. Because Taiwan was ceded by treaty, the period that followed is referred to by some as the ""colonial period"", while others who focus on the fact that it was the culmination of a war refer to it as the ""occupation period"".

&gt;Japan's approach to ruling Taiwan could be roughly divided into two views. The first, supported by Got, held that from a biological perspective, the natives could not be completely assimilated.

210,"I've read opinions that their (Ottoman) control over trade to China was one of the reasons western european naval powers were so open to finding an oceanic route, which led to their discovery of the  New World.  And the discovery of the New World by the western naval powers in turn ultimately led to the decline of the Ottoman Empire by virtue of the difficulty of an already weaker Ottoman navy being unable to gain access to the new lands.

That said, I think this new Silk Road plan by China is going to have dramatic influence over geopolitics in the near future.  It's already causing issues along the LOC in Kashmir between Pakistan/India and China/India borders.  

Pakistan's economy, which has been steadily improving and creating one of the world's largest middle classes, should see further improvement to the economy, and with that, we should see a steep decline in fundamentalism along its Western border.  Conversely, i suspect India will step up efforts to force border issues with China and Pakistan, to make it more difficult for China to build their highway through Kashmir and to Kashgar.

It might also have a slight impact on India's economy, with China no longer necessitating the need to ship oil around India.  Pakistan has already taken steps towards this by expanding their Indian Ocean territory by around 250 square kilometers, making shipping by sea to India a little more troublesome and probably costly.  And if China can build up Gwadar like they are promising, then it could also spell trouble for the Gulf Oil nations, like the UAE and Qatar, which should manifest as more issues with Pakistan.

I think these Gulf Oil/Pakistan issues are already evident with the most recent tension between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  Pakistan is asserting itself more against these states and will likely continue to do so in the future.

243,"Yes, it's a stupid reply. I'll tell you why.

Every country that does something ""good"" that is popular among its citizens, boasts about it a bit. This is human nature. Specially if it has a free press to do the boasting, that is looking for cheap publicity to boost its ratings.

A couple days ago there was a picture posted here about a US aircraft loaded with about 50 rescue workers and 3-4 tons of supplies for Nepal. It was the first aid the US sent to Nepal, and the *only* aid so far, and it arrived in Nepal many days after the earthquake, last Monday.

I don't know if you saw this post, but it had about 6000 upvotes, made front page. It was full of Americans saying stuff like ""fuck yeah, Americans to the rescue, now we'll show the world what rescue means. We've got the best technology and the best aid and we're the most generous country in the world, how lucky for Nepal that we're helping!""

There were literally thousands of comments saying this sort of stuff. Consider that the American aid package is much smaller than that of India or China. Consider that they're sending it many days after the earthquake, when you're basically digging corpses out of the rubble, nobody buried is still alive.

This is boasting, and **every country does it**. It isn't meant for Nepal, it's for internal consumption by the country that does it. It's for their own population. The Chinese media has been full of stories about all the wonderful stuff China is doing for Nepal. If you read them, you may come away with the impression that only China is helping Nepal, nobody else is doing anything.

All of this has nothing to do with Nepal. It's about selling your government's actions to your own public. This is politics, and every country does it. There is no point getting upset over things like this.

&gt;Do you know the news, a 4 months old baby was saved after 22 hours in the rubble? According to India, its the work of Indian Army. I was in that area at that time and I am damn sure, it was Nepali army who did all the work. 

Like I said, it isn't ""according to India"". You are wrong. It's ""according to Indian media"". Indian media is not India. There is plenty of criticism towards Indian media *inside India*, with people saying they are stupid and sensationalistic. If you go to /r/India on Reddit, you will see many posts by Indians criticizing Indian media over the Nepal stories. And you will see dozens of stories of Americans criticizing American media. It happens everywhere that a free press exists. The only place where it *doesn't* happen is in countries like China, because if you are too critical of official media, you will probably go to jail.

There is no need to be offended with such things. Just understand that in democracies, people say a lot of things, and some of them are stupid. You shouldn't blame a country of a billion people because of what some stupid people say.

&gt;Do you know a little place called THAMEL in Nepal? Its a tourist area. Just because Indians happen to visit there, go to pub and club there, it became a LITTLE INDIA???

Do you know Chicago in the US, where I live? There is a whole neighborhood up north near Devon street, called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know New York City? In Manhattan, near Rose Hill, it's called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know Berkeley in California? The area near University Avenue is called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know Edison in New Jersey? It's called LITTLE INDIA. Plus half a dozen other states in the US.

And not just the US. Do you know Gerrard Bazaar in Toronto in Canada? It's called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know Rexdale? It's called LITTLE INDIA. Do you know LITTLE INDIA in Vancouver, Canada? Or Mill Woods in Edmonton, Canada? Or Taradale in Calgary, Canada? All have LITTLE INDIA.

But do you know they also have LITTLE CHINA and CHINATOWN? Or they have LITTLE VIETNAM? Or they have LITTLE KOREA? And half a dozen other countries?

These are just popular tourist designations for ethnic places. Nobody here gets upset about these names, people **love these names**. It makes them feel that their city has a truly cosmopolitan flavor. You are getting offended over nothing.

&gt;Indian helicopters and planes held Nepal airport so that Chinese fund and aid would not land. They are literally playing politics.

That is fucking lies and bullshit. Nepal has **only one** airport capable of landing large aircraft, and that is Tribhuvan in Kathmandu. And that single airport has **only one** runway long enough to land them. It has **no instrument landing system**, every plane must be landed via tower guidance, and it's slow.

This **single long runway in the whole country of Nepal** was damaged in the earthquake so it was no longer usable. It was repaired by Indians, and it has been in use **constantly** since then. The number of flights to Nepal used to be very very small before the earthquake. Now suddenly this single runway is in extreme demand, as dozens of countries try to land planes there. **Of course there will be a traffic jam**. It's like trying to push 50,000 cars through one narrow street.

Indians are getting blamed because they are running the airport. If Nepalese ran it, then Nepalese would be getting blamed. Or if the Chinese ran it, they would get blamed. Because one fucking runway in a whole country isn't enough to land all the emergency flights and take off again.

India isn't keeping Chinese aid out. Two days ago, a Malaysian plane carrying aid was turned back because the airport was too busy. It had to circle the airport for **8 hours** and it had to return to Kolkota twice to refuel before it could land in Nepal. But the Malaysians didn't complain, nor did they blame the Indians, because they **fucking know** the logistics of trying to land hundreds of airplanes on one single runway.

You sound like a nationalistic idiot. Your comments are full of ""national pride"" and stupidity.

Let me tell you what the situation looks like to an outsider. Nepal produces **nothing**. Nepal trades next to nothing. Nepal relies on tourism, and extorts money from its neighbors by playing them against each other. It tells India ""give me money or I'll be closer with your enemy China"". It tells China ""give me money or I'll go closer to your enemy India"". 

Nobody likes these threats, nobody likes paying on threats. It's no different from Pakistan periodically saying ""give me money or we will export more terrorists"". Or North Korea saying ""give me money or we'll produce more nuclear weapons"". Nepal is a gentler form of blackmail, but it's still fucking blackmail.

If I were the Indian government, I would just say ""fuck you, go to China if you want"". See how the Chinese treat you. They took over your neighbor Tibet, and now Han Chinese are settling in Tibet, treating the Tibetans like dogs and servants, taking over their land and turning them into homeless bums. Every few days, a Tibetan monk or nun commits suicide by burning himself or herself to death. That's how the Tibetans feel about the Chinese, but there's nothing else they can do than to burn themselves in protest.

India, on the other hand, has treated Nepal very well. It doesn't treat Nepalese as cattle, because they are the **same fucking people** - same culture, same religion, same language too for many Nepalese though not all. But all I ever hear from Nepalese is how nasty the Indians are.

So fuck them, I say. What's the worst that can happen? Nepal will become another state of China? So what? It's not like Nepal is rich and will make China even richer. It won't offer China any huge advantage that China doesn't already have. The worst it can do is bring the Chinese border closer to India, but India already shares a huge border with China in the east, so what's a few hundred kilometers more? It's not like China could invade and conquer India, a county of 1.3 billion people with nuclear weapons.

All that will happen is that the India-Nepal border, which is visa free and open to both sides will suddenly shut down and become the largest armed camp in the world, on both sides. With Chinese weapons trained on India, and Indian weapons trained on Chinese Nepal. I doubt this will help the people of Nepal, they will just be burning themselves like the Tibetans do today, to protest Chinese treatment.",2,0.0123027551984,0.301061426503,0.489789051875,0.331444039961,1.72916666667,1.0,1508,0.013437849944,12.8888888889,0.15,0.505555555556

Exactly the case. It's a temporary problem that can be fixed with closer (geographically and politically) allies. Something already exists, the BRIC bank, that they can hopefully take advantage of. If Russia doesn't buckle from political/economic circumstances, give it a decade and the BRIC bank will be moving smoothly. That's Russias IDEAL end-game, considering China's massive economy and Indias developing economy. Bad news though, is China is potentially close to popping and is still suffering from the 2007-2008 global recession. 

&gt;It'll be harder and longer for them to get the monetary power they had back however.

It'll be harder for them to gain monetary power directly, but if they begin using the BRIC bank and it works, that provides more stability. They're one of the primary decision makers in the BRIC bank and there's a huge demand in Eur-Asia for an alternative system that the West doesn't profit on. 

The power Russia lost is hurting them extremely hard in the short-term. But the power the West loses if they lose the ability to skim off the top of ALL Asian transactions and the ability to bully with sanctions is far greater of a threat to the West in the long-term.

Just because you put words into my mouth and act as if that's what I said doesn't mean that I don't agree with you. Tell me where I suggested that Iran was ""better off"" or that they weren't trying to ""end the sanctions."" 

Those in power have nuclear weapons or are close economic allies of people with nuclear weapons. Iran is extremely close to being capable of getting nuclear weapons and those in power do not want Iran to have nuclear weapons. The easiest way to prevent it is to cut off their financial funding. Those in power will do anything to protect the advantage they have. And Iran having nuclear weapons may force Iran into the world picture. 

Iran already does trade with China and AIIB countries. It'll only be a matter of time before the East has a strong enough network to make Iran's sanctions not mean as much. That kind of already happened in the past 10 years. Of course they don't *want* the sanctions. It cuts out the world's largest importer and the entire EU. But at the end of the day, they have resources for sale that other countries need. They may not get top dollar for it, but they're getting close. 

A lot of it comes down to making a point and statement with Iran. They know they'd have little chance of winning a war with Israel and the world powers. But, make an example out of North Korea and Iran and other countries will be scared to piss the West off.

[For one, Russia is ALREADY FAIRLY INDUSTRIALIZED. AND Russia pretty much leads the non-Western world in GDP per capita.](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg). Russia-China trade is currently [booming,](http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2014/12/24/china-russia-trade-boom-2015.html) which is a positive sign of economic health. Meanwhile, China and India are still in the process of industrializing. Why is this relevant? It's used to calculate GDP. All new infrastructure is added to GPD. China's GDP is high because they're building this infrastructure - BUT RUSSIA ALREADY HAS IT! GDP from industrialization isn't sustainable - there's only so much you can build. To be fair, Russia's infrastructure lags far behind, has depreciated, but so does the US's (to a lesser extent). Regardless, you're comparing Russia to two very different economies in different stages of development. [The other huge factor is birth rate.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA:CHN:IND&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false). Russia has only recently picked up following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, China and India are prospering from DECADES of insane fucking. Moral of the story? Fuck a lot in a pre-industrialized country and your economy will grow. It should be interesting to see the difference in India vs. China in the coming years, because China put a stop to the intense fucking while India is still reproducing like rabbits. [India, the US, and China are flooded with 20-40 year old workers ATM.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Median_age.png/1280px-Median_age.png). Russia is aging like Europe. With low reproductive rates, that's significant negative points for Russia. BUT, don't ignore this fact either... ""According to a 2008 World Bank statistic 54% of the Russian labor force has attained a tertiary (college) education, giving Russia the highest attainment of college-level education in the world."" The US trails by almost 15%.

Outlook wise? [In 2013, Russia was doing far better than India/Brazil when it comes to foreign investment.](http://www.ey.com/RU/En/Issues/Business-environment/EY-road-to-2030-russian-infrastructure-in-global-context) The sanctions change that, for obvious reasons, but the demand is still there. They only trail China by 12%. 

&gt;Russia doesn't even have enough financial reserves left to pay off the Fascist midgets criminal co-conspirators who are loosing their shirts right now.

I don't disagree with that statement either. Putin has a hard fight, currently. Some of the oligarchs are loyalists, others are just businessmen. At the end of the day, there are plenty of trained marksman for sale and a leader with a target on his head who is the enemy of some of the richest, craziest motherfuckers in the world. Though I don't really see that happening either. 

Unless another round of sanctions hit it looks like the ruble is recovering. It'll probably only recover 50-60% of the lost value, but that's already foregone. Businessmen know this. Businessmen also happen to know that civil wars, assassinations, and major policy changes will hurt Russian morale. 

People underestimate Russia's capability because for the last 25 years they've been recovering from the collapse of an empire aka glasnost. The US prospered following WW2 because they didn't claim land - they focused on Japan and Germany. Russia spread themselves too thin and tried to form too big of an empire quickly. But, underestimating your ""enemy"" is a huge, huge oversight. They still are an industrial machine. They're still the most matched and most willing military enemy of the US. Their military is fairly state of the art in that ""If Russia goes to war, the US might have slightly better tech, but not enough to dominate,"" ignoring the nuke thing. [And if you doubt Russia's efficiency and competence, check out the Sukhoi T-50.](http://www.wired.com/2012/11/russia-stealth/) It's very comparable to the 1.5T F-22 at a cost of only 10B (Though that will surely go up with production and modifications). I'd say they beat us there. Though, they do lag ~5-8 years behind the US so we'd definitely have the edge - but I don't think anyone questions that. 

**TLDR; Hate Russia all you want, but their GDP per capita is the highest outside the Western World, their GDP grew at a similar rate to the US prior to sanctions, they have a decent - but aging - infrastructure, the ruble's freefall ended and is recovering, they're the most educated country in the world (by degree attainment), they're STILL recovering from glasnost, and their military tech is JUST BEHIND the US's at a much cheaper cost.**

&gt; If you think there is freedom in speech in China then I dare you to go there and speak out against the government

If you think there is freedom of speech in the US then I dare you to go there and speak out against the government in a way that matters. Look at what happened to people like Snowden and movements like OWS.

Oh... and funny that you mentioned the protests in Hong Kong. A perfect example of more tolerance and less violence used by China to deal with them than the US authorities used on OWS protesters. There was way less escalation of violence in Hong Kong and very few arrests. There was only *one* major outbreak of violence during the Hong Kong protests and that was as a consequence of thousands of people blocking access to an important government building and the police removing people from that specific area by force. (You know... the equivalent of surrounding the White House, smashing windows, and preventing politicians from entering or leaving. What do you believe would happen to Americans trying to put Obama under house arrest?)

&gt; they were silenced and intimidated

They really weren't. The protests died pretty naturally. In fact, there are still remaining groups protesting but the majority of the population heard the debate, the arguments, and decided to wait for actual results instead of blindly opposing China based on nothing but propaganda.   

You know... unlike in the US, where there was a massive anti-OWS propaganda campaign and protests were violently broken up by police.

&gt;and while free speech in the U.S. isn't a perfect concept

It is a completely meaningless concept because speech literally isn't free in the US. To be heard in the US, you need lots of money.

&gt; I feel a lot more free to criticize my own government right now than criticize China's government when I went there

Of course, that's because you were indoctrinated by your government and media to feel that way. You were raised since childhood to fear China and communism. You are an American.

In the meantime, there are far more protests in China than there are in the US. Far more people speaking out against the government. Far more diverse political opinions. Of course, as an American you never hear about that. Why? Because you don't hear any voice but that of your corporations and your government. Because they are the only ones with enough money and power to scream their messages loud enough.

Edit: Downvoting and desperately censoring the truth won't make it any less reality, my US apologetic friends. Just look at the kind of people arguing against me. No arguments, ridiculous levels of ignorance and misinformation, nothing but personal attacks. Some desperate attempts to attack China while ignoring the fact that the US is plain and simply worse.

If they were as aggressive as you say they would've overrun Asia by now and there would be exponentially more violence and chaos in the world. Instead there is just the violence and chaos that can be primarily attributed to the West. Western Europe and the United States made Africa and the Middle East into the clusterfucks that they are.

They've managed to stick together through long periods of instability, and now their government works to maintain domestic stability and peacefully rise.

That Korea was more closely folded into the Japanese imperial system because of their proximity, ethnicity, and culture.

502,"&gt;I don't know if it is the majority opinion, but a lot of the South Koreans don't want to pay the massive cost of rehabilitating the North as well as fear being flooded with the under-educated yokels up there.

The reunification issue in South Korea is heavily divided along generational lines. Older Koreans, especially those who lived through the Korean War and may have relatives yet living up north, are a lot more likely to want the two countries back together. Younger Koreans who have no sense of cultural or personal attachment to NK are a lot more circumspect. They're also right that they'd likely be heavily taxed for the decades-long process of rebuilding and reunifying the two Koreas if the Kims ever croak, and that has definitely put a damper on the warm fuzzies.

South Korea has a lot of difficulty integrating even the few thousand North Korean refugees it gets in an average year, and it's a small taste of the backbreaking work that integrating millions would be (no matter how slow or careful the process).

&gt;Personally, I think the best bet is a one country-two systems policy.

Yep. This is something that a number of South Korean scholars who have studied the reunification issue have suggested themselves. Ideally North Korea would be turned into a sort of a U.N. protectorate for a few decades, but there's really no solution that's not going to be a political, economic, and diplomatic horror show.

&gt;If the US troops (who have a massive presence there) went home, China wouldn't feel the need for the buffer state. 

This is one of the most delicate and politically troublesome questions to sort through in the event that the two Koreas are on track to reunify:

 - **China** obviously doesn't want the bases there. This would actually be a decent bargaining chip if the U.S. ever wanted the Kims out and didn't care what it had to do in order to make this happen. Offering the Chinese a potential end to U.S. military presence in SK is a very powerful incentive to get them to end support for the Kims.
 - **The U.S.**, just as obviously, does want the bases there. It's a key part of the ""pivot to Asia"" that the U.S. military and diplomatic corps foresee in the 21st century.
 - **South Korea** is the $64,000 question; they could really go either way. I suspect its final decision would ultimately depend on what it sees of its relationship with China, which is its primary export market but has still unnerved a lot of East Asia by being so pushy about territorial claims. Chinese diplomats also created a lot of ill will with their South Korean counterparts during the Six-Party Talks. However, it would be politically easier for SK (both in relation to China and absorbing its northern cousin) to dump the bases, and younger South Koreans generally have more of a problem with them than their older cohorts. The U.S. has also handled various diplomatic issues related to them, most notably the Yangju highway incident, with its usual fuck-ups. I would also fully expect China to offer a very sweet deal of some kind to the South Koreans to get rid of the bases. However, having a U.S. base in your country is Cadillac-class insurance coverage against invasion, so ... who knows.
 - **Japan** definitely wants the bases there.
 - **Russia** would just as soon see the backside of the U.S. in East Asia, but is nervous about China's longterm ambitions. I suspect even Putin sees the U.S. base presence in SK as potentially useful for curbing Chinese overreach while not really having much of an impact on Russia.
 - **Other East Asian nations** will vary, but will probably trend toward wanting to keep the bases if things continue the way they've been going lately. China has border disputes with all of its neighbors barring Russia at present, and hasn't made any friends over the various South China Sea issue. If SK does close the bases, or even some of them, the possibility of the U.S. getting another base elsewhere is the wild card.

I suspect the usual diplomatic muddle with everyone hedging their bets is what would wind up happening; the U.S. would sign an agreement not to expand beyond the current base structure, and/or would scale back the number of soldiers deployed/equipment maintained there, and/or South Korea would close one or two of the bases, possibly just moving their assets elsewhere in the country.",3,0.0348824593128,0.292876640893,0.480241109102,0.286426476237,1.8,1.0,763,0.0494382022472,25.4333333333,0.0,0.25

&gt;Therefore, for China, Pakistan being ""friendly"" with rival powers isn't actually a problem, but a boon, because it can help strengthen Pakistan.

And your analysis fails right out the gate.  You have the understanding of a child.  China doesn't give 2 shits whether Pakistan's relationship with the US benefits Pakistan or not.  They want to remove a potential ally from the United State's sphere of influence.  They want Pakistan in the future to buy Chinese hardware, to use Chinese banks, to have Chinese ports, and TO NOT have close ties with the American military / government.

&gt;At the same time, the US is more worried about disinfecting the Islamist havens in Pakistan than a potential Chinese backdoor via Pakistan.

No, they are not.  I actually already pointed this out.  Specifically.  You're worrying about pawns on the chess board, while the US and Chinese are thinking 500 moves ahead.

[This](http://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/is-india-the-latest-component-of-a-u-s-led-encirclement-strategy-against-china/) is what China is concerned about.  This is why they want to remove US influence over certain countries.


&gt;Second, Chinese leaders tend to see various manifestations of a U.S.-orchestrated containment strategy directed against China. Washingtons so-called pivot to Asia, especially the emphasis on strengthening strategic ties with traditional allies such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, has already aroused Chinese suspicions. So, too, has the Obama administrations none-too-subtle tilt toward countries that dispute Chinas territorial claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea. In addition to Washingtons support for Tokyo and Manila, the administration has openly cultivated an informal strategic partnership with Hanoi, yet another rival claimant.

&gt;Indications of meaningful security ties between the United States and India are, therefore, not likely to be seen merely as motivated by mutual concerns about Pakistan-based terrorism.

516,"&gt;Certainly not the observers of the sides that are somehow involved in the conflict

The main party responsible for the entire conflict is the US, so they must be banned, too.

Same goes for all NATO nations as well as any country that is under control of the US or is allied with it and/or willingly hosts military bases, so that eliminates countries like Australia, Japan, South Korea, etc., too.

So, international observers from where? India and China are still free, I guess.

&gt;That's why international observers exist. 

In many cases, international observers exist to serve the interest of whomever is paying them.

Why are Americans so opposed to a referendum with the idea of letting California join China? We should put that to a vote. 

&gt;Crimea becoming a part of Russia or staying with Ukraine

Crimea will never become a part of Ukraine again. If anything, it would become an independent state.



&gt;If the vote in 2014 was legit it would show the same results anyway.

Why should there be another vote?

Because countries like the US don't want to accept reality? Everyone should waste time and resources because the US says so?

517,"I'll start dismantling your argument with your last point.  China is afraid of being encircled.  But not by an alliance that includes Pakistan.  Notice your own source talks about India being the latest addition to the containment net.  Even without talking about Chinese-Pakistani ties, it's unlikely that Pakistan and India would ever willingly enter an alliance group with the other in it.  When we factor in PRC - IRP ties, it's next to impossible to flip Pakistan against China.  Which was precisely my point in my last post.

&gt;And your analysis fails right out the gate. You have the understanding of a child. China doesn't give 2 shits whether Pakistan's relationship with the US benefits Pakistan or not. They want to remove a potential ally from the United State's sphere of influence. They want Pakistan in the future to buy Chinese hardware, to use Chinese banks, to have Chinese ports, and TO NOT have close ties with the American military / government. Do they want that tomorrow or a month from now? No, obviously not - these things are about years or even decades.

Sure, they certainly want Pakistan to buy Chinese stuff, give access to Chinese ships, basically be a Chinese ally.  Do you want to know why they'd also want Pakistan to be close to the US at the same time?

Remember the Bin Laden raid?  One of the helicopters couldn't make it out of there.  The Pakistanis invited Chinese engineers to take a look at it almost immediately after.

You ever look at the J-10 fighter that the Chinese started producing a few years ago?  Kind of looks like a F-16.  Probably because the Pakistanis provided one to the Chinese to study.

It almost sounds like Pakistan is a pretty reliable ally to China, doesn't it?  Nah, can't be.  Definitely not.

&gt;No, they are not. I actually already pointed this out. Specifically. You're worrying about pawns on the chess board, while the US and Chinese are thinking 500 moves ahead. The Pakistani Taliban / Haqqini network are nothing but a distraction. They mean next to nothing compared to geo-politics.

And you're a moron to think that if the Taliban were left alone, it wouldn't become an even bigger problem in the future.  Maybe one with nuclear weapons.  Don't talk about geopolitics.  You don't understand it.

Just like the last century the unfinished business of one war will lead to an even bigger war. Absurd, completely and utterly absurd. 

Plot Prediction: Saudi Arabia and Turkey conquer Syria with ISIL. ISIL, or ISIL backed successors gain their caliphate in Syria. Iran (post 5+ deal is now stronger then ever) decides that a proxy and special forces war is no longer an option, takes the fight direct to the caliphate. Turkey stays out, because NATO at this point is practically willing to kick out the dam country in revenge for helping ISIL. Saudis support with lots of money, but the caliphate doesn't last. Saudi planes fly in, dog fights and bombing in caliphate airspace. Security council goes crazy threatens to do something, ends up not doing anything. 

War escalates, troops from both sides meet for the first time in large combat operations. War goes international. Iraq joins the fight, after months of horrible insurgency in the north west. Kurds join in, work with Iran to stop an invasion from caliphate into their lands. Larger battles. UN is shitting its pans. Oil goes to 125 a barrel. US Navy reenforces the gulf in an attempt to prevent a stop in the flow of oil and a naval battle. 

The world is starting to give a fuck. After two months news on the subject dies down, world stops giving a fuck. War is WW1 style, battle lines and trenches are everywhere. No major offensives, yet.

Shits starts to get serious again. World economy is in danger. Very large offensive into caliphate, massive casualties. Saudi Arabia loses battle. Oil is 155 a barrel. 

Dog fights over caliphate, Iran goes for the kicker and start doing massive bombing runs over caliphate cities. 200,000 dead escalates to 250,000 in less then three months. Turkey joins the battle, claims it fears invasion. Attacks Iranian planes. Iran responds. Oil stays at 155 a barrel, market cant handle any more. Fear of a naval battle in the gulf (preventing oil supplies) leads to massive support for the war to end. Europe finally takes action, doesn't really do anything. China starts supporting Saudi Arabia, they need oil to go down. US is refusing to reenter a war in the region again. Russia supports Iran, only in revenge for the elimination of Assad. Oil goes to 165, people start to go crazy with how much more expensive things are getting. Market confidence crashes. Massive support to end the war.

If you're poor and white, you can teach English, model, etc. If you're poor and brown you basically can get a very limited blue-collar work visa to do the undesirable jobs, if you're lucky. Many Taiwanese would like to deny this, and it isn't the official law on paper most likely, but I've yet to see this proven false in practice. This basically keeps the types that would be radicals out, for better or worse (probably better). I've seen like maybe 4 Indonesian women with Burka's in the entire 4 years I've been here. 

Culturally, Taiwan is very non oppressive and open to all creeds and sexualities. I've never seen hatred towards homosexuals, or any type of religious hate. I've seen some lighter forms of racism, and there definitely is classism (not a real word, but I hope that makes sense), but no place is perfect. 

The police are competent and respectful here, at least from what I've seen. there seems to be a good amount of oversight both politically and corporately (well, not so much oversight, but if someone is caught cheating, or cutting corners, they get absolutely crucified in the media, no coverups or bailouts, so I guess that's something)

There are also a very high amount of cctv cameras in Taipei city, so there is very low crime compared to any other major city. You're on an island and you'll never get away with it, so that's a big deterrence.

You are right they are pushing for more military autonomy recently, but that's for three very valid reasons. 1. The economy has been stagnate to poor for two decades. Defense spending is a way to artificially pump the economy. 2. China is a real threat to expanding their influence through the Pacific maritime region. They need to be able to defend their trade routes and assets in the region and don't want to be completely dependent on the US for that. 3. The Japanese were fully aware their great economic miracle was greatly due to the US taking care of security duties from the 1940's through 1980's and buying all of their exports. After two decades of economic stagnation though that feeling of closeness has soured, which is one reason why there has been a bigger backlash against US bases on the islands recently.

734,"A nation with a large amount of debt has to pay a large amount of interest on that debt, which is pretty much the extent of the problems caused by having a large amount of debt.

In all honesty, even the ratio of debt to GDP is a pretty bad one. It would be better to look at the ratio of the *interest* the country is paying on their debt to its rate of nominal GDP growth (which is essentially a combination of the country's rate of real GDP growth and its rate of inflation).

The key thing is that debt is valued nominally, not relatively. This means that as a currency inflates, debts held in that currency devalues - $100 today is ""worth"" much less than it would have been a hundred years ago, after all! But while a country could pretty much ignore its debt if it had a high enough rate of inflation, high inflation tends to cause a number of other problems.

Even with zero inflation, a country with a high rate of real GDP growth (real GDP growth, of course, being GDP growth adjusted for inflation) can also safely hold a great deal of debt. This is because as the GDP of a country goes up, so does the government's revenue. This results in a situation that can be somewhat readily analogized to personal debt. Imagine you had a credit card that has a 5.0% yearly interest rate that you have a debt of $200 on, and your income is $1000 a year. This means you pay $10 a year in interest on that debt, or 1% of your income. But let's now say that, for some reason, your income is increasing at a rate of 5.0% each year. This would mean that after one year your income is now $1050 per year. Now, that $10 you are paying in interest is only 0.952% of your income. Moving forward, after another year it is only 0.907% and after a third only 0.864%. This growth assumes that inflation is zero, i.e. it is real growth.

Part of the reason that the 2008 market crash was so bad for the US was that, for the first time in a long time, its nominal GDP *dropped* - to the tune of 0.30 trillion USD, or 2.04% of its pre-crash nominal GDP. But since then, the US has resumed a consistent rate of nominal GDP growth at about 0.5875 trillion USD per year, which translates to a yearly rate of increase of about 4%. The US pays a little over 2% interest on its debt, which is very low, comparatively speaking - this reflects the fact that the US is considered one of the safest possible investments (which, interestingly enough, is much of why the US Congress's near failure to pay its debts (the whole ""debt ceiling"" fiasco) was such a big deal).

While I'm not terribly familiar with Japan, something one notices right away about it is that its rate of nominal GDP growth is nowhere near as stable as the US's - while the US's has been positive for many decades with the exception of 2008, Japan's looks like [this](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?hires=1&amp;type=image/png&amp;chart_type=line&amp;recession_bars=off&amp;log_scales=&amp;bgcolor=%23e1e9f0&amp;graph_bgcolor=%23ffffff&amp;fo=verdana&amp;ts=12&amp;tts=12&amp;txtcolor=%23444444&amp;show_legend=yes&amp;show_axis_titles=yes&amp;drp=0&amp;cosd=1994-01-01&amp;coed=2014-10-01&amp;width=670&amp;height=445&amp;stacking=&amp;range=&amp;mode=fred&amp;id=JPNNGDP&amp;transformation=lin&amp;nd=&amp;ost=-99999&amp;oet=99999&amp;lsv=&amp;lev=&amp;scale=left&amp;line_color=%234572a7&amp;line_style=solid&amp;lw=2&amp;mark_type=none&amp;mw=1&amp;mma=0&amp;fml=a&amp;fgst=lin&amp;fgsnd=2007-12-01&amp;fq=Quarterly&amp;fam=avg&amp;vintage_date=&amp;revision_date=).

So simply holding a large amount of debt doesn't affect anything financially - that is left to the amount of interest a country is paying on their debt and the rate at which their nominal GDP is growing.

Politically speaking (which you probably aren't, but I'd like to take a moment to address it anyway), debt has exactly zero effect. All those people who constantly clamor and wail over how ""China owns the US!"" and suchlike are completely incorrect. Not only are they incorrect factually (China holds a pretty small portion of the US debt, as it turns out), but conceptually too - in no way, shape, or form does holding a large portion of a country's debt grant you influence over it. Imagine if China somehow was able to demand the US buy back all of the bonds it owns - all that would happen is the US would finance it by selling bonds to other countries, the net effect simply being that the debt is moved from one holder to another.",36,0.0907416512059,0.146301125244,0.460392547928,0.270765441646,0.6845,1.0,800,0.0554272517321,29.6296296296,0.0267857142857,0.520238095238

Well, according to many guidelines and laws (sometimes secret ones, whatever that means) I can be pretty much arbitrarily considered ""enemy of USA"" for undisclosed reasons and any time I can get raided, kidnapped and my ass can be drilled even if I didn't do shit (""secret reasons""). How your statist ass will explain to me how that was OK?
In before you say ""but it didn't happen to you"". It already happened to many others that physically could not do any harm that would allow such treatment. Most explanation you get is ""oops"" or nothing.

Also nice defending USA by actively trying to weaken encryption standards and security of information systems in your own country NSA jackasses.

When you have an army that can invade whole world several times over only with conventional means, your main enemy isn't even China or Russia. It's the power hungry assholes inside. You can't justify overreaching and attacking civilian information security on international level trying to control all. Hell, let's say backdooring all widely used solutions is OK. Still, fucking over NIST and other standard bodies to adopt backdoored/flawed algorithms (Dual_EC_DRBG comes to mind) is just not excusable. Also it's not like NSA completed it's all defensive jobs or anything. There are shitloads of government computers with gaping security holes open to anyone. I feel like power hunger of US government will consume everything US people stand for in the first place.

Before people take it as an attack against national pride or something, all this applies to other governments too. It's clear that Russia and China are shitholes when it comes to digital freedom.

Think this through over time.  After 10 years, we have bought $4 trillion of Chinese goods and accrued $4 trillion in IOUs.  Those IOUs must be repaid with interest.  As long as the dollar maintains its global dominance AND as long as there is a global surplus in supply of all things as there is now, then we can finance this deficit at a very low cost.  But what if, global demand - aka domestic demand in China - grows to where inflation rises and interest rates must in turn go up?  Suddenly the interest cost of carrying old debt (something that must be covered before you even consider borrowing even more money) goes up from say 1% to 5%, then the annual service cost of this debt rises from $40 billion to $200 billion.  We lose $160 billion in national purchasing power.  Now consider that the federal deficit is actually about $18 trillion a year and growing and could be around $20 trillion in todays dollars in ten years from now.  And lets say we pay an average of 3% today in interest and it rises to 6% in a decade (not an unreasonable assumption considering that the debt is termed out up to 30 years).  The annual interest cost of servicing the old debt would then rise by $600 billion a year.  And, if global finance market lose confidence in the strength of our economy and interest costs rise to double digits, then living standards will be in for a very bad time.

So back to symbiotic economies.  Each year, China is gaining capital investment, real economic production capabilities, skilled jobs, industrial infrastructure and each year the USA is gaining borrowed funds that enable us to buy foreign goods without the requisite capital investment, real economic production capabilities, skilled jobs and attendant infrastructure.

776,"I think this is a fair question because of my brevity and essentially my foobar with ""Americanization"" when in reality, ""Westernization"" is a better term for the process I am pointing to. 

I understand China is the largest consumer of Ivory (though I am pretty sure this stat isn't per capita adjusted) but the real issue is why/how did China get into this market. We, the US, through our exploitation of the Chinese economy have essentially shot ourselves in the foot as an economy (in fact, if you look at Australia, a ""western"" state, it actually consumes more goods from the Asian economy than the US, simply because they produce goods more cost effectively -- and this was not so a few decades ago). So while China is essentially a communist nation, as an international player, they are just the same as the rest of the western capitalists and why, because that's how we prop'ed them up with respect to using their economy to reduce the costs of ""US"" goods (note we don't even call many of these things US goods anymore... it's all made in china). So the point here is the greed that is embedded in capitalism is ultimately what is driving the desire for ivory. If it wasn't profitable, they wouldn't do it, so again we can look at the nations that need to do great protection of soon to be endangered species but you really cannot stop the issue until you fix the demand curve (which is to say change human desires, economy, etc). 

So long story short, when you look at China and there new position to reign the global economy, note they learned most of their tricks (and desires) from the US (and the desires part is more apt for the word ""Americanization"" but the global capitalistic economy is more apt for the word ""Westernization"")

EDIT: What I am pointing to is this idea, ""whereever there is a will, there is a way"". The demand curve sets the ""will"" of the consumer and as such, we have to address the ""demand"" for these goods to really stop the cruel injustice that is going on against so many rare animal species.

&gt;I ask, because when you look sort by income inequality here China is actually worse than the U.S.

That's income inequality and a completely different concept than what we are discussing. Income equality is impossible to fairly manage in a capitalist system and supply and demand governing compensation of workers. Income equality can have a strong or weak effect on socioeconomic equality within nations depending on what measures are taken to continuously redistribute wealth (e.g. capital gain taxes, inheritance taxes, eminent domain, etc.).

Income equality is an example of something that will be impossible for China  (and everyone else) to develop sustainably and something that will get a lot worse in the future until eventually becoming better again due to the ability of the country to become more aocialist over time. 

Disproportionate compensation is part of the capitalistic development process of any nation, including China.

Chinese aid is divided into loans and grants. Grants are usually for projects like constructing roads and housing, and in these there may be a lot of Chinese companies and Chinese experts involved. The loans are just loans- although these days they are more likely to be at market rate, they are unconditional. By comparison, loans provided by the West will be via the World Bank and the IMF and these have historically required adopting economic policies that are often quite painful for the receiving country.

As far as using Chinese companies and Chinese experts, well, other countries do that too. The US contracts out most of its direct aid (aid through the World Bank and UMF) to for profit American companies like Chemonics, Louis Berger, Tetratech and so on.

Japan justified their invasion of Taiwan as reconcilement for the aboriginals killing the crew of a wrecked Japanese ship over 20 years prior. This gave them the sentiment that the aboriginals were cruel and vicious, and they were to be conquered or gotten rid of.

855,"Yes. And this is the most speculative of my assumptions and you may be correct.  The scenario I see is that over time China grows its domestic demand economy and continues to rise the value added chain where low cost labor is outsourced to other nations as is already occuring.  At some point in the future, it will be in China's best interests to have a strong currency in order to lower the costs of the tremendous demand for imported raw materials to support domestic demand.   In fact, recent trends in factory automation may accelerate this ""tipping point"" (normally detest that term).

Also, i have a difficult time understanding how economic imbalances can remain in place indefinitely.  Can the model of net importing $400 billion a year of Chinese goods last forever?  

And, there is a considerable economic advantage given to the economy of the nation who possesses the global currency of choice.  China is aware of this and is moving towards making the Yuan an international currency to at a minimum share the international stage with the dollar.

China's labor force is young but rapidly aging due to their one child policy.  There will come a time when domestic labor needs to be used to tend to domestic needs - health care for example, rather than the production of goods for export.

Finally, this scenario assumes we continue to weaken our economy relative to theirs from the standpoint of production capabilities, weak savings and investment to where global confidence in the ability of our economy to back our debt obligations weakens relative to the global confidence in China's.

And - second finally - just the scale of China, when per capita incomes approach ours, China's GDP will be 4x ours, will dictate that they are the dominant global currency of choice by the rest of the world.

So, yes, there will be very strong internal pressures within China to maintain the status quo of supporting a manipulated weakened currency in order to continue mercantile economic policies based on exported goods, and these forces will prevail for far longer than they should if governed strictly by market economics.

However, at some time in the future, these artificial manipulation will have to self correct, and China's currency will have to seek equilibrium at the much higher valuation that markets deem it is worth.

What is totally uncertain is when does this happen.  5, 10, 20 years from now?  And will it be gradual - as they are attempting to achieve by slowly revaluing the Yuan - are will some event trigger a rapid revaluation with attendent destructive economic consequences?

The Chinese leadership is fully aware of their longterm goals and is striving to ""scientifically manage"" this economic transition.  Whether they can achieve this smoothly without making gross mistakes, or whether the markets override their efforts, no one knows.

So, back to your statement, yes China will want to keep its currency devalued for as long as possible to maintain its exporting model.  However, it cannot last forever and more importantly, as their economy transitions to one of domestic demand, the time will come when it is no longer in their best interests to let it continue.

Like it was in 1941. The UK tried to stay out of WWII too, but was eventually dragged in over Poland, though it didn't actually fight until Germany attacked the UK expeditionary force in Europe. At that point it came very close to losing. Japan attacked the US because it saw the US as being able to stop its expansionist plans in Asia and decided rather foolishly that a pre-emptive attack would stop this.

Right now China is equally foolishly developing AA/AD and 'Assassin's Mace' weapons to either stop the US intervening in support of Japan or Taiwan or to deal such a heavy blow to US forces that it stops the intervention. Japan has loads of plutonium and solid fuelled space launch rockets that would make excellent ICBMs. The only reason it doesn't declare itself as a nuclear power is that the US has instead put Japan under its nuclear umbrella. However if the US stopped that policy, it'd go nuclear. Of course there's no saying how China would react to that development. given that Chinese and Japanese ships clash all the time over the Senkakus. Also Taiwan and South Korea probably have the capability to go nuclear but choose not to because the US guarantees their safety.

What happened in Ukraine shows that Russia hasn't given up on 19th Century style territorial expansionist. It is deterred from attacking NATO powers though, primarily because of US military power. Still if the US pulls the plug on NATO it may well decide it could take out the UK and convince France to stay out of the war. In that case it could then do what it wanted in Eastern Europe. 

Iran is non nuclear but could make nukes in a year or so. Saudi Arabia could buy them from Pakistan. Israel is an undeclared nuclear state and may well strike pre-emptively if Iran has nukes. Or it may not, it is not clear what its red line is.

940,"i disagree. i actually think traveling abroad is much more affordable today than it was, giving many more opportunities for people who have never traveled before to leave the country and bring their expectations with them. 

the wealthier tend to have traveled more and be more adjusted to different surroundings. or, they simply have enough money to make sure they are surrounded by the same comforts, even when in India or another developing country. 

the ugly American comes from both the wealthy and the new travelers. it frequently comes from students going abroad for the first time - who are likely obnoxious in the university town where they study as well. 

they stereotype definitely originated in the 50s though and is parodied quite well in the movie OSS 117: Lost in Rio. that's when Americans started to become more visible because not all of them were speakers of multiple languages any more. and Americana started to appear everywhere.

Americans are in a unique place because 'American culture' appears in so many places with both a positive and negative impact. and of course people are more vocal about the negative impacts, and even if they are just joking around about McDonald's being ""real"" American food, it has a type of reinforcing effect where people associate things.

Americans certainly are frequently loud, but there are just a lot more of them also. it's hard to say they are louder than the Russians or Israelis or Indians here in Bangkok. it's hard to say the Americans are louder than groups of Scots or English Lads that i've encountered all over the world. or Italians. 

this most recent bout that everyone is having with the Chinese has been super clear here in Thailand. they've gone beyond the typical ugly American stereotype by kicking bells at temples with their feet (really, really uncool here), screwing up bathrooms so bad they have bathrooms specifically for them, and pushing their way through lines (i've experienced this one multiple times). it's partly due to the way trips are organized for them with these mass tours (what a nightmare) and partly due to the fact that the ugly American was/is still much wealthier than the rude Chinese traveler and has much, much more exposure to international culture before they travel.

it's easy to take for granted (and blame on individual Chinese offenders), but open internet, chatting with people, and while limited, the international programming and characters from different countries in programs/movies is exponentially higher than what Chinese experience. they are often culturally isolated and their government is actually largely to blame. 

once again China is trying to chop a head off of a hydra instead of figuring out why the problem is getting so nasty and out of control.

These scores have real effects on a person in that it could affect their employment prospects or finances.

950,"You are right.  Not every Chinese tourist is like that.  I have worked in tourism for a number of years and am still involved indirectly, I have even actually worked in mainland China.

I can tell you what the problems are  (the following contains generalizations about Chinese travel groups):

*  Sudden increase in middle class in China has allowed people more than ever to travel, which has lead to:
           -  Large amounts of Chinese travelling
           -  Large amounts of Chinese who have previously had little westernization in their lives travelling

*  Chinese travel in tour groups, fairly large ones often.  They are also in a BIG HURRY. They are only given a short period of time to be in the country they are in.  Example - there is a tour that runs out of China that does Australia and NZ in something like 7 days.     How do they do that?  They go to as many places as possible as quickly as possible.  Chinese are BIG on taking photos.  Photos are the proof to take back home to show everyone what they saw, and they definitely want to have as many DIFFERENT photos as possible with many special (and perhaps in your eyes, not so special) objects as possible - that random fountain, that big tree, that statue, that shop, that dog, that whatever.
Large groups being moved quickly through densely populated areas, who all desperately want photos are NOISY and they push one another and others and yell loudly to one another to get their photos done.

* Mainland Culture.  You don't understand it... and you don't like it.  That's a HUGE part of the issue.  Things that are normal in China, things that I had to get used to living there, are foreign to you, but not just foreign, they are seen as rude and classless to you (general you).
 

     - In China is it ok, and VERY common to spit on the ground (and make gross hacking sounds while doing it) you will see old women, men, whatever doing this.

    - In China, baby/toddler type children wear, I dunno, ""jumpsuits""? that have a flap around the butt that can be unbuttoned... and they dont wear nappy underneath.  They undo that flap and will let the baby pee on the ground or in a trash can or some such.

   -  Chinese people talk loudly.  They live in a country that is densely populated... you need to speak up if you want to be heard.  The language is also tonal, so the same 'word' to us can be pronounced with various tones to have different meanings - so the language sound is foreign to us, and often native english speakers find the language 'brash' and 'ugly sounding'.

   - Again population based, if you live in Beijing, you are surrounded by people, cars, bicycles and all sorts of of hackneyed vehicular messes constantly, when the bus comes... and there are shit loads of people waiting for it - you gotta just go for your life.
Aint nobody got time or space for a queue. 


*  Chinese have insulated tours (often) where they see all the sights in that country, but will eat at Chinese restaurants the majority of the time, their guide will be Chinese, their driver will often be Chinese (but living in the country they are visiting) so they are surrounded by their own culture whilst on tour - they don't get much interaction with the people of that country - there is no time, the tour isnt sold to them with that in mind.  


*  In Rural areas of China, outdoor ablutions are common.   In China the squat toilet is very prominent - except in Hotels and in shopping malls and tourist areas they now have both squat and 'western' toilet.  The squat toilet is considered to be healthier and cleaner than the throne style westerners use.    
There is a big cultural divide around ablutions.



EDIT TO ADD:


*  Food choices and delicacies they bring with them whilst travelling is also a bit of an issue.  Unfortunately, Chinese have a bit of reputation of bringing in things that aren't allowed - such as medicines with ingredients disallowed in most western countries, also fruit and other fresh products.  
Whether a language barrier, just not realizing or just 'hoping that the fresh ginseng plants in my bag wont get caught' or whatever it is... it's a concern for countries with who require very strict biosecurity controls to protect their environment and wildlife.

In mainland China, people don't queue in line.  Especially outside of the major cities like Shanghai and Beijing.  Instead, people crowd around the booth, and push their way to the front.  It seems generally tolerated, and the people that were there first don't seem to be overly upset when other people push in front of them.  I don't know why.  To anyone in the world that isn't mainland Chinese, it's VERY confusing behavior.

In mainland China, drivers ignore the rules of the road, and don't yield right of way to pedestrians.  When you are crossing the street and the flashing green walking man sign is ahead of you, it means almost nothing.  Cars could come from any direction, and they won't stop if you're in the way.  They expect YOU to yield to them.  Chinese law states that cars must yield to pedestrians in such situations, but none of the drivers follow this.
If there is a traffic jam, mainland Chinese drivers will drive on the wrong side of the road, and honk in ANGER at the cars that are on the correct side.  It's maddening.  They will drive on the sidewalk, and scream in frustration at the pedestrians that are walking there, in their way.

In mainland China, people will simply push you if you are standing where they want to be.  A big hard push.  This is when trying to get on a bus, a subway, or if you wave down a taxi and are about to get in.  They will just push you out of the way.

In mainland China, people speak to each other at a volume approximately 10 times louder than anywhere else in the world.  There is no consideration about the people around them.  They will SCREAM into their cell phone while sitting on a bus surrounded by other people.

It's not that these behaviors are not considered rude in mainland China.  Such behavior is rude ANYWHERE.  The problem is that in mainland China rude behavior as outlined above is simply more tolerated than... well... anywhere else in the world.  People just deal with it, and then adapt an ""if you can't beat them, join them"" rationale.  Even when foreigners (who would otherwise behave normally) arrive in China, they immediately adapt to the new rude realities that is mainland China.

These are the FACTS about how mainland Chinese people behave in mainland China.  So when these people travel to other countries, they behave the only way they   know how to.  They push.  They speak FAR too loudly.  They don't queue in line.  They drive recklessly.

Nearly all the Asian tourists that visit Australia are called ""Nip"", which is actually a derogatory term for ""Nippon"" when the Japanese tried to invade Australia and even bombed Darwin.

Japan had at least 10-15 years head start on China in terms of economic growth and development, but they're still terribly backward even today with China already overtaking them as the second largest economy in the world and fast catching up on the US.  China is a huge country where only 10-15% of it was responsible for its financial success, it will take the rest of the country of mostly farmlands to catch up economically, socially and culturally.  I lived in both city and countryside areas of China and I had no problem fitting in either places.  In fact, I lived like a king in China whereas in Japan I overpay to live in a shitty shoebox.

In Japan, they still insist on using squat toilets everywhere including schools and most public places that I wouldn't dare use if my life depends on it.  I absolutely dread using squat toilets so I was apprehensive about going to China, but as it turned out it was no problem whatsoever, just as long as I was not going to a remote old town that hasn't been upgraded yet (which they probably have by now).  Never had to face a squat toilet if I could help it, never saw anyone piss or shit on the street, but that's not to say that it will never happen.

China is trying to copy the f-35 because they obviously know the plane is capable.

The newer f-16s are inferior because of electronics/they're just out dated.

They're slower, have a smaller payload and are less stealthy. 

The entire reason the f-35 is so great is the electronics, the targeting and how it ties into the rest of the fleet.

Who said it's ""unique""?

The point is that the US is the absolute worst and most other countries engaging in similar behaviour only engage in it because of the US.

Lots of other countries try and minimize conflict. And that includes China, a country not relying on war to fuel its economy. A nation that understands that there is a lot more money and power in collaboration and economic competition. 

&gt;If a country like Russia or China was the world's dominant military power, I think you would have a lot more to complain about, assuming they wouldn't censor you.

I really doubt that. 

The US is such a terrible nation because it is designed as such.

The corporate capitalist oligarchy ruling the US and the establishment of a permanent war economy make the success of the US incredibly unsustainable and also reliant on perpetual warfare. No other country does that. China's rule would be a lot more sustainable and peaceful. China also *will* eventually rule except the US starts a world war and its rule will most likely be marked by total economic and diplomatic domination and the eventual establishment of socialist approaches to economy, not military rule and unsustainable corporate capitalism.

The sad fact of Latin America is that it has seen a long series of violent coups that put authoritarian regimes in power.  But to hear some people tell it, whenever the government changes power to a U.S.-friendly government, it's ""the CIA"", but whenever it changes to a leftist government, it's ""the people"".  That's propaganda.  In nearly every case, coups were almost entirely internal affairs that outside governments had little or no involvement in.

Once you starting looking past the propaganda and closer at the details, you can see that more clearly.

&gt; 1963 Dominican Republic - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Juan Bosch in a military coup. The CIA installs a repressive, right-wing junta. (not democratically elected)

&gt; 1965 Dominican Republic- A popular rebellion breaks out, promising to reinstall Juan Bosch as the country's elected leader. The revolution is crushed when U.S. Marines land to uphold the military regime by force. The CIA directs everything behind the scenes. Openly protect facist dictator that they had put in power AGAINST the wishes of the people.

So, when a revolt throws a leftist government out of power, it's ""the CIA""; when a revolt tries to install a leftist government, it's ""the people""?  Nonsense.

The facts are rather inconvenient for the leftists here.  The revolt that took Bosch out of power was an internal revolt led by the military.  Bosch was voted into power in an election, but his policies were deeply unpopular, and the military threw him out after less than a year ([Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Bosch#Coup_d.27.C3.A9tat)). Another military coup friendly to Bosch followed, and after a civil war ensued, the U.S. intervened in order to restore stability.  The country held free elections in which Bosch ran again and was defeated.

If all you read was the propaganda above, you'd conclude that the U.S. didn't want a democratically elected President in power and threw him out.  The facts don't support that conclusion.

1030,"&gt; China wants the minerals and oil either in the area or to maintain a safe way to move those resources. 

Yes, every big country wants additional resources from around the world.  China doesn't own land in Israel (except the few companies they recently purchased); China certainly doesn't own any Palestinian land (illegal under their law for foreigners to own anything).

The point here is that everyone wants to come into the Israel/Palestinian/Arab conflict with their giant spoon and mess with the gumbo;  **but they aren't going to eat it!**

Too many cooks and none of them have to eat the final product.  That's the problem.

What?  Are you seriously going to use that level of problem for **countries** to intervene?  If that's the case, where are you on Sudan?  Where are you on Syria?  Where is your country and your personal effort to stop the atrocities in Yemen or Afghanistan?

1031,"&gt; First off take some deep breaths dude, im not angry or trying to argue just dumping some thoughts out. 

That's cool and I'm glad that you're taking this easy.  I know that my tone can come off as a bit pedantic or angry; this isn't on purpose, simply my way to cut to the heart of the matter.

&gt; Thats not even happening right now. How could another country oppress through peaceful resolution? And again either Israel or Palestine can decline Chinas potential future offer of help in this situation. You make it sound like China has a gun to Israels head. 

China has security council status in the UN and carry weight in the international community, similar to Russia/USA/France.  From that position, they can influence the Middle-East, like Russia has by supplying weapons to everyone and anyone who wants it there.

You seem to think that countries only ""negotiate"" with one another, but the reality is that there's trade deals, weapon/technology exchanges, and support for opposition within a country by foreign nationals.

I question China's ability to bring about ""peace"", as they have no vested interest in peace, only resource extraction.

&gt; Theres lots of fucked up shit going on in the world right now to say that you cant want an end to the fighting in Israel and Palestine before tackling every other greater problem is a bit of a deflection. 

No, it's not a ""deflection"", what it is a **worldwide distraction** from problems at home, by focusing on strangers abroad.  You've heard the saying that ""people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"".  Well, the reality of news and people is that they *want to* throw stones to *feel better* about the mess in their own house.  Israel acts as that worldwide political distraction from problems at home.

The truth is that we as a humans are mortal and have limited resources.  We can only focus our attention to one thing at a time.  If I'm talking about Israel, that's time that I'm not talking about Sudan or Syria.  We're not gods, we cannot do everything at once.

To focus on a foreign problem, that we do not have a vested interest in, is a distraction.  It's trying to tell others to clean their home, while ignoring our own.

&gt; Again respectfully not trying to anger you but Israel and Palestine have had plenty of time to resolve and the longer it goes on the more and more we see that they are unable to bring the fighting to an end.

So has [India and Pakistan over Kashmir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict), but they still haven't resolved it.  Yet, for some reason, you're not talking about intervening there... Hmmm... wonder why?

&gt; Both Israel and Palestine receive shit tons of money from the international community

So you think you **purchased Israel's sovereignty with foreign aid?**  Is that what you're saying, that a few billion dollars in assistance suddenly nulls a country's sovereign democracy?

Think about what you're saying; American colonial capitalist mentality over running the world with money?

&gt; Israel is a big trading partner for America and in this case China any country that does large amount of trading has a vested interest in keeping their trading partners stable and safe. 

Trading partner is one thing, you're infantalized country that you feel you can do what you want with is another.  Try respecting the only Jewish country on the planet, instead of pretending that they don't have the same rights to their land and what to do with it as any other country on the planet.

&gt; I honestly dont see what the big deal is if peace is possible. 

It's not, that's the problem.  The [Palestinians have clearly rejected peace](http://www.timesofisrael.com/tv-report-abbas-said-no-to-obama-on-3-core-peace-issues/) on numerous occasions and to pretend that peace is on the horizon is a lie.  Adding another cook to stew this pot will only make it worse, like I said.

&gt; Israel is almost literally stuck between a rock and an Islamic place, their neighbors arent the biggest fans. Wouldnt it be great to get peace and Israelis wont have to worry about the surrounding countries trying to destroy them? Security feels nice. 

Did you just inject heroine into your blood?  You're talking fantasy, as though talking about it will make it into reality.  That only works when you're on drugs.

&gt; I have a vested interest in peace. Do you? I dont actually have a TV.... so I dont watch shows like that. 

No, you don't live in Israel or Palestine.  You don't have a vested interest in *their peace* because if war breaks out, it wont be your life or the life of your family in trouble.  Try understanding what you're role in this world is, instead of thinking everyone can do everything.

&gt; I completely agree. Im a patron and I dont mind telling the cook what he is serving tastes like shit. 

Great, now realize that the restaurant is in the Middle-East and the cook doesn't really want you to tell him anything, since you don't eat there regularly, pay taxes to the country, or even know the cook's name.

1069,"&gt; 1. Salafism isn't as simple as most redditors think it is. Salafist Jihadism is the problem here not salafism. 

The ideology at its heart is radical. Wahhabism is inherently a radical ideology. Iranian Twelverism is bad too, btw, but in a much less destructive way (to other peoples) than Wahhabism. Wahhabism inherently breeds intolerance and the desire to purify the Umma. There is a reason why you constantly have fanatical Jihadists emerging from Wahhabism, from the Ikhiwan movement early on in the 19th century, to al Qaeda, to the Taliban, to Al Shabab, to Islamic State. Saying that Salafism isn't the problem is wrong because Salafism is the fuel for Jihadis to emerge. 

&gt; 2. Saudi Arabia does not fund or support Alqaeda or ISIS. Saying something like that is circle jerking and proof you don't know fuck all about the situation in the middle east. 

Then perhaps read my comment again. I was very careful to say 'by extension' and 'indirectly'. No they didn't support Al Qaeda directly, but they spend billions of petrodollars yearly pushing the blood drenched march of Wahhabism around the globe. This is how you got the same type of fundamentalist ideology sprouting up everywhere. Al Qaeda is nothing more than a branch of Wahhabism which pointed out that if Wahhabism is preaching about erasing impurity and corruption and about the corruptive influence of infidels and apostates then why does Saudi Arabia partner with the greatest  infidel power, the USA? Al Qaeda then split with the Wahhabi establishment over this issue of hypocrisy. The Wahhabi establishment has no real response to Al Qaeda, but they aren't willing to end their cooperation with the USA due to their personal greed. 

Similarly with the Taliban, Saudi Arabia supported them all through the Taliban's reign of terror over Afghanistan, until the Taliban started to fight the west, then they split. But at its heart there is nothing distinguishing Saudi and Taliban ideology. It's just that Saudi is hypocritical on this one issue (relations with the USA). 

This is why the greatest amount of support for these terrorist groups still comes from the Gulf, it just doesn't come from the state, it comes from the radical society which has been radicalized by the Saudi state which has showered billions of dollars on the Wahhabi establishment which controls education.

&gt; Iran openly funds and supports Hezbollah, and allegedly supports the Houthis, and many Shia militias, yet saudi seems to love terrorists. 

Houthis are in no sense terrorists. This is hilarious, you have AQAP operating in Yemen, a real terrorist group which blows up Shia mosques and busy market places and focuses on blowing up western targets, but the group you call terrorists are the Houthis, a group which has Sunni members and which does not target civilians. Jesus, this is unbelievable. You are just calling them terrorists because that who your buddy Saudi Arabia decided to start bombing rather than AQAP. 

Hezbollah has used terrorism against Israel, which sucks, but in a completely different way than Wahhabi Jihadism sucks. Hezbollah is a nationalist group, and non-sectarian, friendly with Christians and other minorities. They don't threaten anyone other than Israel, and they haven't even attacked Israel offensively for about a decade. From the perspective of the USA this isn't even remotely as problematic as a group like Al Qaeda, ISIS, Taliban, etc which exterminate minorities and target westerners. One ideology is infinitely more toxic than the other from our perspective in the USA.

&gt; 4. The comment was right, iran has executed way more than saudi already this year,  but it gets less stick. There's no reason for that but a biased attitude here. It's fun to hate on Arabs in this subreddit and love anything that isn't arab, like kurds or Persians.

First off the whole numbers of executions are a bit skewed because Saudi Arabia has a tiny population compared to Iran. Similarly China has way more executions than Iran, but that doesn't mean that it's worse than Iran.


Secondly, number of executions isn't at all the reason why someone might think that one country is more harmful than another. I don't see how Iran executing dozens of drug dealers should be relevant to relations with them. You want to look at the international influence of that country. And Saudi Arabia has a terrible influence. It spreads the hateful ideology which gives birth to international terrorism around the world. It actively supports dreadful groups like those in the Islamic Front in Syria who slaughter Christian and Shia civilians. You can tell the morality if Saudi state by how when it looks at AQAP and the Houthis, it decides to launch an air campaign against the Houthis. It's insanity.

National borders matter far less than traditional lands of families and tribes. Furthermore, it's not like the Israeli nation took these lands by force in some kind of war.  Britain and the US essentially created the country after WW2 in compensation to the Jewish people who had lost so much after the Holocaust and wanted a Zion, a place to call their own.

It's easy to understand, then, why Palestinians living in Israel is 'no big deal'.  Western values (particularly those of the UK and US) include freedom of speech and religion, the ability to be whoever you want without fear of persecution. This is reflected in the Israeli Constitution, a document which had a lot of US/UK influence in its drafting.

That's also where you run into the 'Zionist' problem. There are members of the Jewish community who believe the land of Israel was ordained by God for them.  The Torah proclaims the Jews as the 'Chosen People', after all.  So it's no issue to those groups to continue moving into Palestinian territories, because God has given the region to them.

Except that, for Palestinians, *none* of that land belongs to them.  Israel has existed fewer than a hundred years. The Palestinians' families and ancestors have lived in that region for several hundred (closer to several thousand) years. They just see white men from the UK and US saying ""this land belongs to Israel now"" like it's truth, and they don't recognize nor respect it.  It's like when you were a kid; if your brother comes into your room, takes a toy and says ""this is mine now"", that doesn't make it his.  That makes it stolen.

What are the radical elements of salafism? You are throwing words here that most people in this thread, like you really, do not understand, its a generalisation of subsect, equal to saying catholics are at their hearts violent due to the crusades. Salafist Jihadism is the ideologys more violent offshoot, a more political salafism. Salafism is conservative, yes, but its no more conservative than a some Christian or Buddhist ideologies.  

Purify the Ummah? Doesnt every subsect or sect believe it is the pure form? Salafism didnt even start with Muhammed Ibn Abdulwahib, where the term Wahhabism originated from, its ideals were formed by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, known among Salafis as Imam Ahl al-Sunnah and the three scholars commonly titled with the honorific Sheikh ul-Islam, namely, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim. The Ikhiwan are nothing but a 19th century militia group of early salafist jihadism. 

The point is, you are generalising a demonising salafism, as if it was that simple. I recommend you read the actual teaching of salafism, and the differences between salafists themselves. All you mentioned are salafsit jihadists, who mix their salafism with political ideologies, and jihadism. They arent anything special. And the Taliban, arent salafist theyre Deobandi Sunnis. Now what we can agree on right now is, Islamism in general, is toxic.

&gt; Then perhaps read my comment again. I was very careful to say 'by extension' and 'indirectly'.

The Wahhabi establishment has no real response to Al Qaeda, but they aren't willing to end their cooperation with the USA due to their personal greed.

They spend money exerting influence and spreading salafism? Nothing any other country hasnt done with its own ideologies be it religion or political. Saudi spreads Islam as any Christian missionary group in Africa and Asia does. Its bit hypocritical to hold them to account for this. Saudi is not being hypocritical, salafist dont believe you must be the enemy with the infidel. Again youre mixing salafist jihadism with the normal millions of salafis you are condemning. Al Qaeda split for their own political purposes, and their own offshoot of salafism. This isnt hypocrisy, I dont see the argument at all. They believe in different things, no one is being hypocritical. 

Taliban support? Didnt the US do the exact same thing? Saudi supported the Taliban against the soviets, it was to push up soviet influence in the greater middle east. Again not the same Ideology. Your statements echo the many misconceptions and idiotic statements I see on reddit daily.

This is why the greatest amount of support for these terrorist groups still comes from the Gulf, it just doesn't come from the state, it comes from the radical society which has been radicalized by the Saudi state which has showered billions of dollars on the Wahhabi establishment which controls education.

The gulf is radical? Havent seen Dubai yet have you. ;), Again youre generalising a lot and its kind of sad now. The state doesnt control education as much, its delegated to religious clergy, who define and change the curriculum on a yearly basis, Saudi Arabia has also changed its schooling system in the past 5 years, as its not solely influenced by the state only rather than clergy.

&gt;Houthis are in no sense terrorists. This is hilarious, you have AQAP operating in Yemen, a real terrorist group which blows up Shia mosques and busy market places and focuses on blowing up western targets, but the group you call terrorists are the Houthis, a group which has Sunni members and which does not target civilians. Jesus, this is unbelievable. You are just calling them terrorists because that who your buddy Saudi Arabia decided to start bombing rather than AQAP.
Hezbollah has used terrorism against Israel, which sucks, but in a completely different way than Wahhabi Jihadism sucks.

Wow, I guess its terrorism when western targets are the priority. Houthis are totally innocent, I guess them holding their banners with ""God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam"" is totally freedom fighting material. They seek to overthrow the government and install a shia led one. (Although as you can see the population is mostly Sunni) Houthis arent as innocent as you love to portray it. And Iran isnt as progressive as you love to portray aswell. No one is targeting civilians, but houthis are targeting everyone who they perceive is a threat ofcourse.
Your argument is actually funny, the Syrian rebels are made up of some salafis and are anti-alqaeda and ISIS, yet they are terrorists too right?

In 2007 Houthis expelled Yemeni Jews from the Houthi stronghold of Al-Salem and again 2014, they were expelled from from the town of Raydah in the Amran governorate. The Houthis were bullying a small group of impoverished rural Jews in the name of their war against Israel and Zionism. ""Cursed be the Jews"" is a Houthi slogan. Houthis have been destroying Jewish homes, confiscating their proprty, forbidding them to work and expelling them. Stones are thrown at children in the street.

Pretty much false, Hezbollah is committed to targeting its sunni targets nowadays since the Syrian civil war, and yes they arent anti western but somehow that makes them good? Killing goals in general isnt good whatever the target.  
I guess the 2012 Burgas bus bombing is past a decade right? And their plots to attack Egypt in 2009 too, and Rafic Hariri, lebanons president, was assassinated by Hezbollah too. Hezbollah fighting with Syrian Government against sunni rebels is also as justified as the Houthis now right?

Toxic or not, both POLITICAL ideologies are toxic.

First off, that is what some people assume on Reddit, I was just making a statement that if Saudi is so bad for these executions, why isnt Iran. Im talking about the countries relating to executions, as its more condemned and gets a bigger uproar when Saudi does it but not Iran. (Lol at the drug dealers part, I dont see why Saudi executing drug dealers and murders is relevant to the relations with them). See my point? You came here to defend Iran but your biased attitude to them, just resonates lovely in your comments I love it. The lack of reading you do about the ideologies you condemn and even the countries you condemn and defend is LOVELY. 
Your whole last paragraph is pretty much insanity, AQAP didnt gain ground until the houthis emerged, giving AQAP time and less resistance to gain control in Yemen.

With respect to Xinjiang, again, Xinjiang is a Chinese construct.  The Uyghurs hail from the Southern part of Xinjiang while the Han have migrated to the North.

[his 3rd day in office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_100_days_of_Barack_Obama%27s_presidency):

&gt;In his first week in office, President Obama signed an executive order suspending all the ongoing proceedings of Guantanamo military commission and ordering that the detention facility would be shut down within the year.[115][116][117] He also signed an order requiring the Army Field Manual to be used as guide for terror interrogations, banning torture and other illegal coercive techniques, such as waterboarding.

so.....that doesnt sound at all like what you're trying to claim.

so again, if you're referring to guantanamo, it was one of the very first things he tried to do after taking office and was stopped by republicans from doing it.

It is already one sided for China even IF they all teamed together, which hasn't happened. North and South Korea also have issues with Japan. Half of ASEAN members aren't even in the South China Sea dispute.

The picture data is clear, even if we fantasized about all of them ganging up on China, it is still one sided. This is why a China/Russia team is such a mismatch.

America dominated and occupied the mainland over a couple of centuries, and only in the 20th century did we occupy Hawaii. We occupied Japan after we beat them in the war, same with Korea. We occupied Iraq and Afghanistan after destroying the countries. America gets away with it because it is the mighty superpower.

China dominates and occupies a considerable amount of land that has either never been Chinese or has people there that do not want to live under Chinese rule (see Uighurs, Tibetans, Western half of China). China's influence is extending into waters that are not theirs as they ram Vietnamese boats and fish on coral reefs. China gets away with it because everyone wants their money.

England...well, let's not pretend that England got where it is today just through stiff upper lips. There was a period of the largest empire in the world. Now they occupy North Ireland and Scotland wanted to split away from 'em. England sort of gets away with it but is less influential than either China or America.

Russia just attacked Crimea and Ukraine. Let's repeat that: **Russia attacked Crimea and Ukraine.** Siberia wasn't even Russian until the Russian Empire decided 'hey, see that big land filled with Mongols, Turks, and Siberians? Yeah, ours now'. Russia is a warlike nation run by criminals; we all expect this.

There is a border dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both screaming about land being taken from the other. No one cares.

Syria is in a state where nobody knows who's occupying what because everyone's killing and murdering each other. No one cares, typical Muslims.

North Korea? Yeah, North Korea, again, nobody cares, UN doesn't care to make a big deal about it because North Korea is dangerous.

In fact I'd say a great deal of Europe has benefited enormously from their colonial histories. Moreover European nations were the ones that almost completely destroyed us Jews in the first place, something that took place over two thousand years. Why the hell should we care what Europe has to say? They benefited from stealing Jewish property, slaughtered them in droves, and now that Israel is involved in conflict (that they didn't even start) *now* it's wrong. *Now* the Europeans are shining beacons of human rights (lotta good it's doing them, see refugees pouring into Europe and increasing antisemitism) who protest a rather small, insignificant conflict in a small, not terribly important nation that is distinguished by the fact that it is Jewish. It is neither participating in genocide nor ethnic cleansing and yet people treat it as such. It gets *way* more attention than other far more barbaric countries and yet often categorized with the same visceral hatred.

I strongly dispute the idea that Israel is even occupying anybody. The pulled out of Gaza, which was a huge mistake since the Gazans elected Hamas and started throwing rockets and suicide bombers at them, culminating in a giant wall that, surprise surprise, has cut them off from the rest of the world - Egypt seemed to think it was a great idea as well. The land that the Israelis 'occupied' was land that certain *extremely aggressive warlike people* **lost** when they **were beaten in warfare**.

The civilized world has benefited enormously from a history of aggression, warfare, colonialism, thievery, and brutality, and now that Israel seeks to act the same as any other nation state they are automatically branded as 'naughty people'. The Jew among nations who may strive but will never be like them in their eyes.

Prior to the sanctions/Ukrainian war [(You can check here)](http://knoema.com/nwnfkne/world-gdp-ranking-2015-data-and-charts), they were just BARELY surpassed by India. Sure it's a couple years of poor GDP, but that certainly hasn't impacted their *capability.* Here's the problem comparing Apples (Russia) to oranges (China/India). [For one, Russia is ALREADY FAIRLY INDUSTRIALIZED. AND Russia pretty much leads the non-Western world in GDP per capita.](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_map_GDP_per_capita.svg). Russia-China trade is currently [booming,](http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2014/12/24/china-russia-trade-boom-2015.html) which is a positive sign of economic health. Meanwhile, China and India are still in the process of industrializing. Why is this relevant? It's used to calculate GDP. All new infrastructure is added to GPD. China's GDP is high because they're building this infrastructure - BUT RUSSIA ALREADY HAS IT! GDP from industrialization isn't sustainable - there's only so much you can build. To be fair, Russia's infrastructure lags far behind, has depreciated, but so does the US's (to a lesser extent). Regardless, you're comparing Russia to two very different economies in different stages of development. [The other huge factor is birth rate.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:RUS:UKR:USA:CHN:IND&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false). Russia has only recently picked up following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, China and India are prospering from DECADES of insane fucking. Moral of the story? Fuck a lot in a pre-industrialized country and your economy will grow. It should be interesting to see the difference in India vs. China in the coming years, because China put a stop to the intense fucking while India is still reproducing like rabbits. [India, the US, and China are flooded with 20-40 year old workers ATM.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Median_age.png/1280px-Median_age.png). Russia is aging like Europe. With low reproductive rates, that's significant negative points for Russia. BUT, don't ignore this fact either... ""According to a 2008 World Bank statistic 54% of the Russian labor force has attained a tertiary (college) education, giving Russia the highest attainment of college-level education in the world."" The US trails by almost 15%.

Outlook wise? [In 2013, Russia was doing far better than India/Brazil when it comes to foreign investment.](http://www.ey.com/RU/En/Issues/Business-environment/EY-road-to-2030-russian-infrastructure-in-global-context) The sanctions change that, for obvious reasons, but the demand is still there. They only trail China by ~~12%.~~ 1.2% 

&gt;Russia doesn't even have enough financial reserves left to pay off the Fascist midgets criminal co-conspirators who are loosing their shirts right now.

I don't disagree with that statement either. Putin has a hard fight, currently. Some of the oligarchs are loyalists, others are just businessmen. At the end of the day, there are plenty of trained marksman for sale and a leader with a target on his head who is the enemy of some of the richest, craziest motherfuckers in the world. Though I don't really see that happening either. 

Unless another round of sanctions hit it looks like the ruble is recovering. It'll probably only recover 50-60% of the lost value, but that's already foregone. Businessmen know this. Businessmen also happen to know that civil wars, assassinations, and major policy changes will hurt Russian morale. 

People underestimate Russia's capability because for the last 25 years they've been recovering from the collapse of an empire aka glasnost. The US prospered following WW2 because they didn't claim land - they focused on Japan and Germany. Russia spread themselves too thin and tried to form too big of an empire quickly. But, underestimating your ""enemy"" is a huge, huge oversight. They still are an industrial machine. They're still the most matched and most willing military enemy of the US. Their military is fairly state of the art in that ""If Russia goes to war, the US might have slightly better tech, but not enough to dominate,"" ignoring the nuke thing. [And if you doubt Russia's efficiency and competence, check out the Sukhoi T-50.](http://www.wired.com/2012/11/russia-stealth/) It's very comparable to the 1.5T F-22 at a cost of only 10B (Though that will surely go up with production and modifications). I'd say they beat us there. Though, they do lag ~5-8 years behind the US so we'd definitely have the edge - but I don't think anyone questions that. 

**TLDR; Hate Russia all you want, but their GDP per capita is the highest outside the Western World, their GDP grew at a similar rate to the US prior to sanctions, they have a decent - but aging - infrastructure, the ruble's freefall ended and is recovering, they're the most educated country in the world (by degree attainment), they're STILL recovering from glasnost, and their military tech is JUST BEHIND the US's at a much cheaper cost.**

All that napalm, agent orange, tons of Vietnamese dead, economic destruction, and the *largest bombing campaign in history at the time*, and the Chinese **still** couldn't beat them. 

 On November 3, 1978, the Soviet Union and Vietnam signed a twenty-five year mutual defense treaty, which made Vietnam the ""linchpin"" in the Soviet Union's ""drive to contain China. 

The Chinese were originally attempting regime change, for christ's sake, they were moving against Russia.

Deng even evacuated a third of a million citizens in Xinjiang, put the country on alert, and essentially said to the Russians, ""don't fuck with us"". 

lol too bad this happened:

* The PLA advanced quickly about 1520 kilometers into Vietnam, with fighting mainly occurring in the provinces of Cao Bng, Lo Cai and Lng Sn. The Vietnamese avoided mobilizing their regular divisions, and held back some 300,000 troops for the defence of Hanoi. The People's Army of Vietnam (VPA) tried to avoid direct combat and often used guerrilla tactics.

The initial PLA attack soon lost its momentum and a new attack wave was sent in with 8 PLA divisions joining the battle. After capturing the northern heights above Lang Son, the PLA surrounded and paused in front of the city in order to lure the VPA into reinforcing it with units from Cambodia. This had been the main strategic ploy in the Chinese war plan as Deng did not want to risk an escalation involving the Soviet Union. The VPA high command, after a tip-off from Soviet satellite intelligence, was able to see through the trap[citation needed], however, and committed reserves only to Hanoi.

Once this became clear to the PLA, the war was practically over. An assault was still mounted, but the Vietnamese only committed one VPA regiment defending the city.[citation needed] After three days of bloody house-to-house fighting, Lang Son fell on March 6. The PLA then took the southern heights above Lang Son[43] and occupied Sapa. The PLA claimed to have crushed several of the VPA regular units.[9]

The PLA now resumed their attacks aimed at the major provincial capitals and key communication centres in the border hinter land. Major battles developed at Cao Bng, Lang Son, Hoang Lien Son, Lai Chau and Quang Ninh. The aim of these attacks was to draw in the regular VPA formations and inflict heavy attrition on them through classical ""meat-grinder"" operations. There were fierce attacks and counterattacks; in Lang Son the Chinese launched 17 counterattacks to regain one objective.

By late last week of February, the Vietnamese had still not committed any of their regular divisions which were being held back for the defence of Hanoi. They had also not pulled out any of their 150,000 troops in Cambodia.

On March 6, China declared that the gate to Hanoi was open and that their punitive mission had been achieved. On the way back to the Chinese border, the PLA destroyed all local infrastructure and housing and looted all useful equipment and resources (including livestock), severely weakening the economy of Vietnam's northernmost provinces.[9] The PLA crossed the border back into China on March 16. Both sides declared victory with China claiming to have crushed the Vietnamese resistance and Vietnam claiming to have repelled the invasion using mostly border militias. Dr. Henry J. Kenny, a research scientist for CNA, points out that **most western writers agree Vietnam outperformed the PLA on the battlefield**",4,0.0392846497765,0.185731955819,0.302085864955,0.277747138652,1.05,1.0,622,0.0404312668464,22.2142857143,0.0,0.5

I guess you'd call the larger conflict the Battle For Hanoi, seeing as the whole point of the Chinese advance was to capture the capitol, and prevent Vietnam from doing two things:

--Surprisingly this statement includes the word ""leftist"" being that the other posts purposely left out this angle to falsely give the narrative that the U.S. was involved only because it was being mean or just wanted to make money as you say. Again the people themselves rejected Torres and the CIA backed those opposition groups full on because Torres was in bed with the Soviets and the weapons involved in that violence came straight from the Soviet bloc.  ""If in the wake of Vietnam I can no longer send in the Marines, then I will send in the CIA.""Senator Frank Church, 1976

The revolution is crushed when U.S. Marines land to uphold the military regime by force. The CIA directs everything behind the scenes. Openly protect facist dictator that they had put in power AGAINST the wishes of the people.""

--Once again this statement purposely leaves out the conflict being centered on U.S. vs Communism and makes it seem like it was U.S. vs Dominican Republic. President Johnson sent in forces to prevent another Cuba situation.  Elas Wessin had stated: ""The Communist doctrine, Marxist-Leninist, Castroite, or whatever it is called, is now outlawed."" When forces loyal to the Soviet bloc, armed with Soviet supplied weapons, made headway the U.S. responded in kind. There is no way in anyone's imagination the U.S. would allow Soviet influence in this hemisphere to go unchallenged. The reason the Soviet angle is purposely left is to further the false narrative that the U.S. was simply acting to make money as you say. 

""1964 Brazil - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. Puts a millitary junta in power (Not democratically elected) and later it is revealed that the CIA trains the death squads of General Castelo Branco (who is one of the facist dictators US puts in power).""

-- The people of Brazil and the military of Brazil overthrew their leader Joao Goulart because he began to socialize the economy. He gained power after Jnio Quadros resigned. Joao Goulart was in Communist China at the time and when he returned all three branches of the military tried to peacefully keep him from gaining power through a congressional avenue. A compromise was made that turned the government into parliamentary democracy that limited the power of the socialist leader. Afterwards he reinstated his powers and proceeded to make socialist reforms that upset the population and caused the military to revolt. Of course the U.S. backed the opposition groups because in the context of the cold war there is no way the U.S. was going to allow its enemy to gain a foothold in this hemisphere. Again this aspect was left out. 

""1961-63 Ecuador - A CIA-backed military coup overthrows President Arosemana, whose independent (not socialist) policies have become unacceptable to Washington. A military junta assumes command. (not democratically elected)""

--President Arosemana was deposed by his own people after being accused of cozying up to Dictator Fidel Castro. Although he was not far left during the time of crisis he became a worthless alcoholic and even though he tried to make last minute concessions like breaking off ties with Cuba he was deposed by his military. Of course the U.S. backed the opposition.

""1959 Haiti- The U.S. military helps ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier become dictator of Haiti. Not democratically elected""

--Would you be shocked if once again communism was involved? The united States would have backed the devil himself if it meant keeping Soviet influence out of the western hemisphere. Haiti opposed Castro on the international level and Castro supported anti-Duvalier groups.  

""1954 Guatemala - The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Jacob Arbenz in a military coup. Arbenz is replaced with a series of facist dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years. Non of them are democratically elected.""

--Even the wikipedia page on the 1954 Guatemala [coup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) has the word ""communist"" listed over 40 times yet this statement blatantly leaves it out.

How is it that all of these examples leave out the context of the cold war? One of the few places the U.S. was unsuccessful in preventing a Soviet bloc leaning leadership from gaining power was in Cuba. The establishment of tactical nuclear warheads aimed at the United States is an indicator of the very high stakes in which this struggle entailed. The name ""Soviet Union"" simply doesn't carry the same weight with us modern reddit readers as it did during the cold war. When bringing the context back into the events it quickly washes away any notion that the U.S. acted the way it did simply because they ""wanted to make money"".

If you wish to know more, I'd suggest looking into stances by various countries regarding these issues.  Look at the wording of those stances carefully.

Also, China did not try to annex Vietnam.  China had a defense treaty with Cambodia, which obligated them to come to Cambodia's defense when Vietnam attacked them in 1978 (although it could be argued that Cambodia begun the aggression).

Really, the entire area is so important not because of the resources (which is a nice bonus), or the land (the largest habitable island in the region is controlled by Taiwan and they have an EEZ as a result). It is the trade route that travels through the straits there.

The reason why China inherited the claim decades ago and is only now pressing to control facts on the ground today is because it had became their lifeline for vital commodities like oil and foodstuff. The same reason is what prompted China to invest in the ""Maritime Silk Road"" and an alternative port via Pakistan, the ""One Belt One Road"" railways/infrastructure investments through Central Asia and SE Asia, and the rail links with Russia. China is trying to protect itself from being easily starved via a blockade in the SCS, but they need time. As such, they will not take any concrete steps towards settling the dispute (or clarifying the vague U-shaped line like Taiwan did) until the alternative routes are properly set up.

The nine-dash claim was first known as the eleven-dash claim.

China has no military alliance with any country.  But let's look at your list:

Russia - they have their own Russian interests and fear a rising China as well since a rising China is a threat to Siberia and eastern Russia territorial integrity.

Central Asia ""stans"" - they are all within Russian sphere of influence, common language is Russian.

South Korea - they have a military alliance with America and host American troops and bases.

North Korea - They have their own agenda and are playing China and Russia against each other.  They have no loyalty to China.  Kim Jong-Un has yet to meet Xi Jinping because of tensions.

Taiwan - They have a defacto protection of America and use American weapons.  They also hate China and are a defacto independent state.

Mongolia - their client state is Russia not China.

Hong Kong - HKers hate China and CCP

Vietnam - border disputes and they hate China

India - they have border disputes and their GDP is growing faster than China.  India is also playing a defensive game against China by allying with Vietnam, ASEAN, Japan.

Japan - military alliance with America and is rapidly militraising due to Chinese aggression.

Australia - Alliance with America and hosts American military.  They are also deepening ties with Japan and India.

Indonesia - fears Chinese encroachment in SCS and is militarising accordingly.

Philipines - fears Chinese encroachment in SCS and is militarising accordingly.  They also have a military alliance with America and hosts troops.

Singapore - fears Chinese encroachment in SCS and is militarising accordingly.  Singapore also hosts American military and uses American weapons. 

Malaysia - neutral

Thailand -  neutral

Edit (weird rant):  I wanna add that the best weapon is a strong economy with growth...both China and the U.S. have that power.  U.S.'s economy grows at about 2-4%, while China has enjoyed 30 years of ~10% growth.  Simply knowing this changes geopolitics.  The U.S. would back down from China if she were to invade Taiwan.  China would not invade Taiwan though, because China expects sanctions afterwards.  Could China survive with trade inside Asia and Africa?  Could the West deal with a return to a mass manufacturing economy?  India (treated now as a younger non-threatening, China in terms of trade) would benefit greatly if China were to suffer sanctions.  Russia is in bad shape (.6% growth, GDP less than Italy) relative to their potential, but would also benefit as a half-resource half-service economy.

 
TL/DR:  China invading Taiwan (what I consider the most possible China vs. West encounter) would force the U.S back into a manufacturing economy (very bad as manufacturing doesn't have the growth of a service/invest economy).

 The authorities maintained a stranglehold on political activists, human rights defenders and online activists, subjecting many to harassment, intimidation, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance. At least 130 people were detained or otherwise restricted to stifle criticism and prevent protests ahead of the leadership transition initiated at the18th Chinese CommunistParty Congress in November. Access to justice remained elusive for many, resulting in millions of people petitioning the government to complain of injustices and seek redress outside the formal legal system. Muslims, Buddhists and Christians, who practised their religion outside officially sanctioned channels, and Falun Gong practitioners, were tortured, harassed, arbitrarily detained, imprisoned and faced other serious restrictions on their right to freedom of religion. Local governments continued to rely on land sales to fund stimulus projects that resulted in the forced eviction of thousands of people from their homes or land throughout the country. The authorities reported that they would further tighten the judicial process in death penalty cases; however thousands were executed.

I'm only trying to say that the nature and scope of these abuses isn't as severe as China. Again, it's comparing apples and oranges but we could try to make analogies based on the type of abuse.

Genocide/Democide:

As you pointed out, the US is reponsible for the near-extermination of native Americans, arguably tens of millions of deaths. China, particularly under Mao, is responsible for around 60 million deaths (varies based on the source) due to the hundred flowers campaign, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, etc. 

Treatment of minorities:

My understanding is that minority (non-Han) ethnic groups in China face systematic discrimination in socioeconomic mobility and unfair treatment in the judicial system, but I can't find any data at the moment to back me up. 93% of the country is ethnic Han, so it may very well be that the US has a more severe problem in this area by virtue of being more diverse.

Treatment of migrants:

China has and continues to repatriate North Korean refugees, who face severe punishment upon return to North Korea. South Korea repeatedly asks that migrants be repatriated (if willing) to South Korea, but China generally refuses these requests. There are tens of thousands of North Koreans in China without access to education or basic government services due to the Chinese government's policy on repatriation. It should also be noted that China is a signatory to two UN conventions on the treatment of refugees.

Migrants to the US have a comparatively much better situation, in spite of entrenched poverty and corrupt local law enforcement.

I could go on, but like you said it's comparing apples and oranges. It's also kind of useless to see who has the bigger dick, here. Human rights abuses are very difficult to quantify in a way that allows for comparisons between countries, which is the main reason I felt a need to reply to OP in the first place.

They are starting **only two banks**, each with the specific target of competing with some existing institution:

* The New Development Bank (NDB), which will compete with the World Bank
* The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which will compete with the IMF.

Neither is being funded entirely by China, though China has the largest share given its large economy.

The NDB will initially have a lending capacity of $34 billion per year, which will be supported by an initial fund of $50 billion, which is contributed equally by the 5 BRICS countries ($10 billion each). In addition, they will have a contingent reserve arrangement (CRA) of $10 billion, which also be contributed equally by the five BRICS countries ($2 billion each). The goal is to eventually have a CRA of $100 billion, of which China will contribute $41 billion, Russia, India and Brazil $18 billion each, and South Africa $5 billion.

The AIIB has an initial capital of $100 billion, of which China will provide about half. So China does have the largest share, but it's by no means the only contributor. More importantly, this is just the funding at launch, when many countries are hesitant to commit money on something new. As confidence grows, so will investments.

I know people like to demonize China on /r/worldnews, but as a matter of fact, these new banks will be a lot more democratic than the WDB/IMF. For example, with almost 50% of the initial capital outlay, China still only has 5.47% of the voting rights in the AIIB. Contrast that to the IMF with which it competes: the US and Japan (the two largest contributors to the IMF) have a 30% contribution to the outlay, but 26% of the voting rights. So with a smaller outlay (30% versus 50%), the US/Japan have 5 times more voting rights than China (26% versus 5.47%).

That doesn't make the AIIB an association of equals, we all know that China will play the biggest role. But it's still an improvement over the IMF.

The sad thing is that none of this had to be. China and India weren't asking for a whole lot of changes to the IMF. They only asked for 6% more voting rights towards the developing countries in the IMF. But US Congress refused that, so IMF reforms remain stalled.

&gt;China is definitely making moves in renewables, but they've also been consuming a mind blowing amount of coal in recent years, and behind the fancy words there's a commitment to coal as the primary source of energy.

Yes, but the communists have engineered the system that achieved these results... (though they are plateauing well below every other East Asian country that has undergone the same process).

China did have the cultural tools. If you look at the Tang Dyansty they already had a growing semi-industrial base. Also take for example [the philosophy of Mozi, who emphasized scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi):

&gt; [Mozi's]... teachings emphasized self-reflection and authenticity rather than obedience to ritual. 

&gt; ...he criticized the Confucian belief that modern life should be patterned on the ways of the ancients. After all, he pointed out, what we think of as ""ancient"" was actually innovative in its time, and thus should not be used to hinder present-day innovation.

&gt;  Mozi believed that people were capable of changing their circumstances and directing their own lives. They could do this by applying their senses to observing the world, judging objects and events by their causes, their functions, and their historical bases. This was the ""three-prong method"" Mozi recommended for testing the truth or falsehood of statements.

There were periods of scientific enlightenment followed by bureaucratic safety. And it was during a down period in Chinese culture that the Europeans were having their scientific revolution.

You're trying to tell me that 300-500 arrests were needed, that those 300-500 people all had something to do with the murder? And that there was also a good reason for not telling where those people were detained? This is btw not only collective punishment, but also a violation of the Geneva Convention.

&gt; The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.

Protected persons are civilians (the people who commited/helped with the crimes aren't protected)

The majority of the people who were detained hadn't anything to do with the crime or it's investigation, thus there was no lawful reason to arrest them (thus it's akin to kidnapping). They were unlawfully, against their will transported to an unknown place, pretty much the definition of kidnapping. And you know, you don't have to do anything brutal with them for it to be kidnapping. Even if you release them later it would still be kidnapping. The kidnapping is the part of taking them unlawfully against their will and maybe holding them somewhere against there will. It had an effect on the population, an effect of fear. They didn't have anything to do with it, yet they got ""arrested"" for it and Israel denied to say where they're being detained.

&gt; Yeah I don't believe it that IDF attacks civilians on purpose. If we wanted we could kill off Gaza population in about a week. If civilians don't leave battle area it's their fucking problem. There's enough room in Gaza, enough good neighborhoods without tunnels. Look at the map of the fighting if you can find one, I'm sure it's localized to just a few hotspots. I read that Hamas executed people for protesting against the war and for trying to leave battle areas. Too bad, but not my problem.

Nope it isn't. There are civilians in the area, you aren't allowed to ignore this. You can't go and say ""well it's their problem that they were there"". Civilian deaths are only allowed as part of collateral damage, but if there is no good reason to for example shoot at a building and a civilian gets killed in the process, then it's murder. It's a violation of the laws of war. Hamas could say ""well all Israel is our war zone"", so all civilians there can be killed by them, it's their issue for being in Israel? And also you say they should move away, yeah, many did move away during attacks. And returned after the attacks to scavage what's left of their belongings.

Many moved to UN shelter during the war, which you bombed even though no attacks came from them. Oh wait, the UN inquiry was a lie fabricated by Hamas, and you believe IDF shot at them for a good reason, even though they can't show any evidence for it... Oh and all lies by IDF are just mistakes from Spokesman according to you...

And also, you can't kill the whole Gaza population, because if you do this you'll be suddenly alone in the world. Even US won't side with Israel after commiting a genocide. The damage to Israels reputation would be so big, that you would suddenly stand alone in the world, US won't protect you anymore and Israels economy will collapse from sanctions. There is no way that anyone with a bit of brain would risk this, this is probably also the only reason why Israel didn't conquer everything yet, because the reputation loss would be too big for them. And yes they would without the world out there stopping them from doing so, they would've build way more settlements without the world being angry at them for doing so. They stopped building settlements due to political pressure, not because they didn't want any more.

&gt; I don't think settlements are war crimes. Where did you take this definition? Population transfer is a war crime if it's forceful, Jews moved to settlements voluntarily. The law may be applied but there's no precedent, despite many other occupation situation like Tibet, Crimea, Cyprus.

I think this is pretty clear:

&gt; The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention)

It doesn't metter if they want to go there or not, they're not allowed to build settlements.

And also your examples, I don't know what it has to do with Tibet or Cyprus, but Crimea...

Want a list of the sanctions that were put on Russia for what happened in Crimea? Want a list of sanctions that followed it? The world was pretty much completly against it, even Russias ally China didn't side with them! If Russia wasn't that powerful (nukes and oil), then the sanctions applied to it would be more significant, and maybe even military actions against it.

&gt; International courts are total bullshit, it's where the strong exert their power on the weak, it's a popularity contest much like the Eurovision. 

Much like Israeli courts? Using Human shields as Israeli soldier = 3months suspension and a demotion? But yeah, the world is against you all, all courts etc that aren't Israeli are just bullshit...

&gt; About your last paragraph. There's nothing Israelis want more than peace. We thrive in peace, we sell a bunch of stuff to people, we invent stuff, we provide services to tourists. it's a great tourist area - I advise you to visit some time. We don't gain anything from war. We don't gain territory, or money, or respect.

Tell me, if you want peace so much, why vote for someone who said that under his reign there won't be a two state solution? The most likely solution for permanent peace, he said there will be none under his reign and you voted for him. And also Netanyahu is a notorious liar, you want me to believe lying isn't an Israeli strategy with someone like this in power?

If you want peace why hide the fact that the teens were most likely dead and send your soldiers into Area A without coordination with Palestinian Authority, a violation of the Oslo Accords, the IsraeliPalestinian peace process?

If you want peace so much, then why do Israeli soldiers who break the laws of war (like using Human shields) only get a slap on the wrist as punishment? (3months suspension and a demotion)

If you want peace so much, then why build settlements in the occupied territory, taking land from Palestinians and making it more difficult to come to a solution? I mean it's pretty difficult to make a Palestinian state if there are Israeli settlements spread throughout it... (Mind you that they only stopped building more settlements due to pressure from UN, US, etc., not because they're interested in peace and didn't want to make the situation worse down there)

And how about [this](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-to-legalize-four-west-bank-settlement-outposts-slated-for-demolition-1.524291)? Right before peace talks, Israel ""legalized"" 4 illegal Israeli settlements in West Bank, which were marked for demolition. It's like saying ""hey I just took another piece of your land, now we can talk about peace"". Do you seriously want me to believe that people who act like this really want peace? It looks more like they want to take as much away from Palestinians as possible, giving them as few as possible, if they don't agree, take even more from them.

1392,"The Chinese have done extensive research on their energy and pollution challenges (e.g. [IET](http://english.iet.cas.cn/aboutus/overview/)) and National Bureau of Statistics.

In 2013, they consumed 22.4% (US 17.8%) of world total energy and produce 23.2% while emitting 27.1% of world CO2 emissions. Overall, it's low on a per capita basis (1/4 of US/Canada). From 1990 to 2013, energy consumption increased 3.8x or 6% annually.

Problem with their pollution: 

1. Highly dependent on coal (67%) vs US (20.1%) for energy production while US has much higher use of oil and gas. China has higher hydro production, but lower in nuclear until a dozen or so new reactors come online this year or next. Other renewables are negligible. Their domestic coal reserves are high, but have recently started importing. Their gas reserves are low and fracking has yet to begin due to the remoteness of their reserves and deeper locations (requiring more scarce water). 

2. Their industries are energy intensive and many have yet to be fully modern and more inefficient resulting in 30%-40% more energy use. They produce 48% of world cement, 49% of world crude steel, are #1 in many other energy intensive industries. These are low profit margin industries with high pollution (1 ton steel requires 600kg coal and 3-6 ton water for 60 cent USD profit in 2014). China's metals, oil and coal, minerals and chemicals contribute 9.6% of their GDP, but 52% of CO2 production.

3. They have made some headway. They put sulfur scrubbers on 90% of their plants (from 48% in 2007) with 14% reduction from 06 to 2010. NOx and COx are still problems, but NOx is declining since 2011. At Copenhagen, they made commitments to reduce CO2 intensity by 40-45% from 2010 levels by 2005. The three main factors to CO2 production are economic growth, carbon intensity (inefficiency) and industry structure in their economy. On Jan 1st, 2015, the [new Environmental Protection Law](http://www.acc.com/accdocket/onlineexclusives/prcnepl.cfm) give their EPA more power and greater enforcement abilities and a shitload more.

1394,"&gt; China didn't have the scientific base to industrialise. 

Not really true. Stanford Historian Ian Morris has done some very interesting analysis about societal development in history.

It turns out that humans tend to breed out their surplus resources. Or at least used to. This means that while technology will be advancing very quickly at the ""peak"" of such a civilization, it won't be growing as fast as the population is eating away at the surplus which means that things are about to blow up.

Chinese peak (the time when it was clearly the most advanced place on the planet) was around 1150 in the Song Dynasty. However, it's massive population was already placing a tremendous weight on everything and Northern China got invaded at this point. By the time Genghis Khan rode in a hundred years later China's population had already shrunk by 33% and industrial production (in terms of steel &amp; shipping) had shrunk even more. 

This was the third period in recorded history when humanity as a whole went downhill in the sense that the biggest city on the planet was smaller than a decade ago, the biggest army smaller than a decade ago etc. The other two incidents were in the Eastern Mediterranean in 1200BCE (the incident known for the whole ""Sea Peoples"" bit) and in Rome in the first century very soon after Augustus died. 

Whether Europe &amp; US continue to lead the way or not is an interesting question. There is no reason to assume one way or another based on history, as we're in really new territory right now.

Your comment demonstrates a significant level of ignorance about both China as well as how Communism works.

So, to explain:  
1. You don't just become a ""Communist state"" overnight in terms of development. It takes generation and global communist revolution to accomplish Communism. It's the end stage of international human societal development.    
2. The term ""Communist state"" makes no sense as Communism seeks to destroy the concept of statehood. Communism is what happens once all major countries adopted socialist governments and abandoned their national borders AND governments as well as the concept of national currency.  
3. China never stopped being Communist. China is currently in the capitalist stage of national development. Which is a [necessary step](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx's_theory_of_history#The_stages_of_history) in ultimately becoming ""communist"".     
4. China is a [socialist republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_China), which developed its own form of socialism (called [Socialism with Chinese Characteristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics)).   
5. China continues to endorse Marxist ideals and continues establishing new legislation based on a Chinese interpretation of Marxist concepts.   
6. While currently subscribing to capitalist development, China already considers itself to be in the early stages of socialism. Which is very true if you look at how the Chinese government actually operates and what the central planning in the country is aimed at and accomplishes.

Ignorance applies to the consumer, since they will always look for a value and most will not care to find out the true cost of their purchases.

I'm pointing out that consumer demand is driving the pollution problem.  If you had no demand, you would have very little pollution.  It's not a guilt trip.  It's a reality check.  Everyone is blaming China for the pollution problem, but they don't accept their own responsibility for the problem.  It's their demand for cheap goods which drives the problem.  

China is already working to fix the issue, but guess what, it's going to come at a price.  When that price gets to high, companies will get their products from somewhere cheaper and probably a lot more dirty.  Then all the pressure you put on China will be worthless as some other country with lax environmental laws will become the major polluter on the planet.

1. They spent a small fortune on badly organised Olympic games that were just a massive robbery of public money.

2. Then they spent a fortune occupying Crimea, they effectivly destroyed tourism in Crimea (now they'll have to feed extra 2 million mostly unemployed people - that costs a lot, plus food, electicity, water, everything will have to go over Russia if they want to keep it).  Soon they will face attacks from Tatars because they started opressing them the second they took Crimea.

3. Aids (around 2 million Russians have it- that's like something you'd expect to hear from Africa), cancer, drug consumption is on a massive rise but no one is allowed to admit it. Plus ortodox church prohibits the use of pain medication which causes a lot of people to suffer because government doesn't provide medication they need.

3. Chechenia is getting cocky once again, Kadirov will soon think he can bite the hand that feeds him.

4. China is buying everything in eastern Russia. Those cooperation plans you hear a lot about are basicly just China buying Russian oil and gas fields at a cheap, cheap price. Putin does not like it but he need every penny he can get. 

5. Attacking Ukraine also costs more than Putin is willing to admit. Both in lives, money and materials.

6. He is enlarging an army that is already too expensive to mentain (same thing that destroyed USSR).

7. Russians from Ukraine are moving to Russia. Now he'll have to feed them too.

8. He is destroying the economy of Ukraine and Russian industry is very exposed to that, and will suffer because of it. It's like USA attacking UK, in economic terms a very stupid move. He is shooting his own foot.

9. Sanctions hurt a lot and they aren't going away, they might even increase by the looks of things.

I don't really know what you expect as a response to your comment as I already discussed everything you said. Communism and Confucianism sharing differences are not really relevant here.

Communism is a natural conclusion of any society's development. Communism, like capitalism and socialism and feudalism, do not contradict any other ideologies. They just are part of any societal development process and countries that don't follow the process fail. Evidence: All of history. 

The only difference between the US and China is that China isn't opposed to natural societal development and will not violently suppress socialism and eventually communism. Instead it aims to embrace it once the country is sufficiently developed.

1447,"Erdogan is an authoritarian islamist 
&gt;Throughout his leadership, beginning with his election to prime minister in 2003, Erdogan has restructured the formerly-secular education system overseeing the growth of imam hatip, or religious training schools, throughout the country. According to the Financial Times, such schools boasted 63,000 students in 2002-2003; by 2014, the number of imam hatip students had exploded to 983,000.

&gt;What makes this particularly disturbing is the fact that tens, if not hundreds of thousands of these students never signed up for imam hatips to begin with. Rather, Erdogan systematically reshaped existing secular public schools and redesigned the student examination system so that thousands of children are assigned to imam hatips even against their will.

&gt;But he hasn't stopped there. As of a year ago, all public schools also provide mandatory ""religious culture and ethics"" courses beginning at age nine. Yet despite a 2007 European Court of Human Rights ruling requiring education in all religions, human rights lawyer and columnist Orhan Kemal Cengiz writes in Al-Monitor, ""Sunni Islam continues to be imposed, with students required to memorize Islamic prayers and Quranic verses.""

&gt;He has sought to reverse the ban on head scarves in state institutions, called for a ""change of mindset"" in the judiciary,[5] embraced Hamas, and endorsed an Al-Qaeda financier.[6] He has sought to equate religious school education with that of secular schools,[7] and his political party has worked to enforce Islamic alcohol bans in some municipalities

Are you an idiot? all central bank activities are DIRECTLY related, if rates go lower in the US, that means US dollar value follows lower, raising the value of foreign currencies, that is why its called a 'currancy war' or 'manipulating currencies'.

If one country prints, the other will most likely follow to *devalue* their own currency.

Our balance sheet is 4.5 trillion to drive our rates down to near 0%, since the Chinese Yuan is *pegged* to the USD, we *export* our inflation to them, the only way for them to deal with it is to increase the value of the Yuan greatly (to 4.5-5) or print money! they can't risk lower exports so they print money! /jackass

- ""very good chance of negative growth"" in a developing country of 1.4 billion people who have been growing double-digit for decades.

Holy shit, you really are a fucking idiot.

There is NO evidence that they have 1) grown at that rate (their books are closed to public) and 2) that it was organic.

China just started building cities, stock piling minerals/commodities, etc, and buying up foreign assets with values outdated (not mark-to-market).

In other words, China has most likely been lying and the *growth* has been gov't projects that lead to NO growth.

but when you print money, you buy a foreign currency, in turn driving up the foreign currency value (demand) buy selling yours, driving down your currency, make exports cheaper to export!!!

Since 2013, their last update, they have *intervened* in the markets several times .. sometimes lower rates or buy equities outright (they make random announcements with no details).

But these markets move enough (AUD for example will move a couple hundred pips) to conclude that their interventions are 100-200Billion USD at least.  If you know that you have to drive at 50MPH to get past a large puddle of mud or your car will get stuck, you will conclude that others will have to drive at the same rate of speed. So when the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, etc. move the markets, you can assume that it takes the same amount to move the markets by the PBOC.

The same thing happened in the UK during the 'dash to gas'. One of the reasons the UK didn't have a problem with Kyoto is because it was already on track to make the necessary CO2 emissions reductions thanks to the switch from coal to gas for power generation. 

The US famously didn't sign Kyoto but made the cuts anyway. Meanwhile apart from the UK and Sweden most countries that signed Kyoto didn't make the cuts. And in any case China had the most dramatic rise in CO2 emissions over the lifetime of Kyoto but was exempted. Even now China's emissions will continue to rise until 2030.

&gt; How is the fasted climate change ever recorded pretty slow? Not just in the written record, but also in any proxy study? How did you decide that this is not a problem?
&gt;

&gt; If we keep climate change at two degrees per century we'll be boiling the oceans in 50 thousand years. Long before that we'll all be that. 50 thousand years is not much in the lifetime of a species and it is the blink of an eye to the planet.

It's not going to keep warming at two degrees per century though, for the simple reason that it's not linear. 

http://motls.blogspot.com/2014/09/one-half-of-co2-doubling-achieved.html

&gt; The doubling defines more natural benchmark values of the concentration because it suggests that we should look at the behavior of the temperature assuming the exponential growth of CO2. That's natural because the temperature increase is approximately (very accurately) proportional to the logarithm of the CO2 concentration increase (thanks, John). Consequently, every time you double the CO2 level, the temperature increases by the same amount (ignoring non-CO2 drivers). The global mean temperature as a function of the CO2 concentration is
&gt;
&gt; T(c)=14.5C+sensitivityln(c/280 ppm)ln2
&gt;
The temperature 14.5 degrees Celsius is the holy ""optimum"" global mean temperature that the climate alarmists want to see forever (yes, they will also protect our blue, not green planet from future ice ages when the temperature would otherwise drop by 8 C as many times in the past) because it was how things probably were in 1750 although no one can really reconstruct the temperature in 1750 with a sub-degree accuracy (and even today's ""global mean temperature"" depends on so many technicalities that it's fair to say that it isn't defined at a sub-degree accuracy, either). The ratio of logarithms may also be written as the ""base two logarithm"" but I wanted to use basic functions only. Note that ln20.69315.
&gt;
The coefficient ""sensitivity"" is theoretically equal to 1.2 degrees Celsius if we ignore all the feedbacks. The total figure when feedbacks (especially those related to various forms of water in the atmosphere) are included is unknown and it may be higher or lower than 1.2 degrees Celsius. One of the unjustified assumptions of the climate change ideology is that the full figure has to be higher. The higher value of the climate sensitivity you defend, the greater influence over the climate alarmist paramilitary movement you achieve. If you believe that the value of the total climate sensitivity is below an offensive threshold, you are a heretic.

1504,"In this context, consumption-oriented really only refers to the components of GDP which contribute to the total national economic growth figure most economists use as a rough barometer of a country's economic health. [Here is a quick chart](http://imgur.com/6LbLEXT) I put together showing the breakdown of GDP for a handful of illustrative economies. In this simplified framework, GDP is the sum of household consumption, investment (also known as capital formation, i.e. building a new mine, or constructing a new factory), government spending, and the net trade balance (simply exports - imports). Over the past decade, China has been embarking on a grand economic experiment, where the government facilitates the mass injection of investment capital into the economy to build out infrastructure, production facilities, natural resource extraction, power generation, etc. As other commenters suggested, China is effectively trying to accomplish in 10 years what most of the developed world accomplished over the course of the 20th century.

In order to fund this experiment, the Chinese government has gone to great lengths to artificially suppress the value of their domestic currency. In so doing, they have been able to maintain a net positive trade balance, which has helped to fund the mass development described earlier. Ultimately, as their own citizens' living standards rise, and become less competitively priced (from a global labor perspective), China will struggle to maintain this currency suppression and positive trade balance. This whole endeavor, according to many observers, is inherently unsustainable, as it in many ways relies on the persistence of the very same global trends and imbalances that it steadily erodes. Thus a consumption-oriented economy, one in which the majority of the country's GDP is driven by domestic consumption, is considered more sustainable (by some) in that it relies primarily on local, rather than global, dynamics. Recall that extracting natural gas in Texas, turning it into plastics in Michigan, turning that plastic into a toy in Illinois, and selling that toy to a child in Minnesota, is all rolled into domestic consumption (the toy's retail value theoretically reflects all of the component steps, materials, etc.). So ""consumption"" is not necessarily dependent on imports, despite the fact that the US has maintained a net negative trade balance since 1975. Germany, for example, is a consumption-oriented economy that maintains a positive trade balance.",2,0.131625074272,0.110621399859,0.401603217044,0.161043013859,0.433333333333,0.545454545455,387,0.0983606557377,27.6428571429,0.175,0.4375

Three-fourths of its online population is under 35, says comScore report

India has bypassed Japan to become the worlds third largest Internet user after China and the United States, and its users are significantly younger than those of other emerging economies, global digital measurement and analytics firm comScore has said in a report.

India now has nearly 74 million Internet users, a 31 per cent increase over March 2012, the report says.

The numbers are lower than other recent estimates, possibly reflecting comScores methodology that only factors in PC and laptop-based Internet usage.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) pegged the number of Internet subscribers in India at 164.81 million as of March 31, 2013, with seven out of eight accessing the Internet from their mobile phones.

The comScore report, on the other hand, puts mobile and tabled-based Internet traffic at just 14% of the total.

Mobile phone based Internet usage is a key component of Indian Internet usage, and Id say the recent growth is being driven by mobile Internet usage, Nilotpal Chakravarti, spokesperson of the Internet and Mobile Association of India told The Hindu on Thursday. In addition, many Netizens were using dongles to access the Internet.

Three-fourths of Indias online population is under 35 as against just over half worldwide, the comScore report, India Digital Future in Focus 2013, says, possibly reflecting Indias more recent improvements in literacy.

Men under 35 and women between 35 and 44 are heavier users. But women account for less than 40 per cent of all Indian users, a far lower sex ratio than that of other countries.

A quarter of time spent online is on social media, the comScore report says, and another 23 per cent on email.

While Google sites have the most unique visitors, Net users spend the most time on Facebook, which is at second place as far as unique visitors are concerned.

Yahoo, Microsoft and Wikimedia sites follow in unique visitor numbers.

Among social media sites, Linkedin and Twitter are the next most popular, while Orkut is in decline. Google is by far the most popular search engine, accounting for 90 per cent of all searches in India.

Online retail is on the rise, with domestic retail sites being the most popular, the report notes. For online travel websites too, domestic websites are the most popular, the Indian Railways website being by far the most popular destination. Yahoo is also the most popular site for news.

The locus of online dominance has moved steadily towards Asia, which now accounts for 41% of all Internet users; from having 66% of all users in 1996, the United States now accounts for just 13%.

1559,"Uhhh... I seem to recall some clauses at the end of WW2 and some language in the ceasefire agreement pertaining to Japan. 

&gt;One Japanese contribution that was directly controlled by the United States Navy was ScaJap, or the Shipping Control Administration Japan. Operating under the orders of Commander Naval Forces Far East, ScaJap provided logistic support for the Occupation forces with its fleet of Japanese-crewed ships, most of which were former U.S. Navy Landing Ships Tank, or LSTs. From the first days of U.S. involvement in the conflict, ScaJap transported men, weapons and supplies to Korea. Its LSTs were absolutely invaluable to the prosecution of the War, representing as many as three-quarters of the LSTs available for the amphibious operations at Inchon, Wonsan, and Hungnam, as well as for the day-in and day-out work of routine logistics.

When the Korean war began Japan was still occupied:

&gt;In the third phase of the occupation, beginning in 1950, SCAP deemed the political and economic future of Japan firmly established and set about securing a formal peace treaty to end both the war and the occupation. The U.S. perception of international threats had changed so profoundly in the years between 1945 and 1950 that the idea of a re-armed and militant Japan no longer alarmed U.S. officials; instead, the real threat appeared to be the creep of communism, particularly in Asia. **The final agreement allowed the United States to maintain its bases in Okinawa and elsewhere in Japan, and the U.S. Government promised Japan a bilateral security pact.** In September of 1951, fifty-two nations met in San Francisco to discuss the treaty, and ultimately, forty-nine of them signed it. Notable holdouts included the USSR, Poland and Czechoslovakia, all of which objected to the promise to support the Republic of China and not do business with the Peoples Republic of China that was forced on Japan by U.S. politicians.

From the bilateral agreement:

&gt;The agreement contained five articles, which dictated that Japan grant the United States the territorial means for it to establish a military presence in the Far East. Moreover, the accord stated that Japan be prohibited from providing foreign powers any bases or any military-related rights without the consent of the United States. 

This agreement was superseded in 1960 by the mutual cooperation treaty:

&gt;Article 5, which dealt with armed attacks by a third party, required that the United Nations Security Council be involved and that any measures taken by the U.S. and Japan be ceased ""when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.""

And the argument that Japan's constitution prevents them from interceding in foreign countries because the US is attacked is false as of 2014:

&gt;In July 2014, the Japanese government approved a reinterpretation which gave more powers to its Self-Defence forces, allowing them to defend other allies in case of war being declared upon them, despite concerns and disapproval from mainland China and South Korea, whereas the United States of America supported the move.

However even still the text of Article 9 makes it clear that Japan renounce their *sovereign right*,

&gt;ARTICLE 9. Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.

Because of the emphasis given to the UN &amp; the Security Council (where the US holds a permanent seat) it could be argued that Japan cannot legally act without US (or UN) permission, and therefore is subject to US command as agreed to by South Korea in the armistice. There is ample precedent for this.

However, because it is fully understood that any attack on America would result in an immediate and unavoidable war... the Japanese are basically saying they would act on American behest and retaliate immediately until UN Command (cough, America) gets a handle on the situation. 

This would be legal if America/UN doesn't object after the fact, but could also be used against them. In the case of North Korea attacking... that probably isn't going to be the case.

1) Based on my submitted evidence, China has also demonstrated clear intent to assert soverignty in the region, administered it as part of Hainan, managed its resources, and contested claims against France. China is ""most active claimant"", earliest ""effective occupant"", and possessed similar historical claims (if not superior) to the island. The article's impression of an unbroken history of Vietnamese administration by omitting everything in the gaps is rather academically dishonest, don't you think?

2) Following French withdrawal, North Vietnam (the side that won) actually admitted the sovereignty of China for a time, and supported China expelling South Vietnamese ships from those isles.

So long as North Korea doesn't engage in any sort of war, the people will remain convinced nobody WANTS to take them on. This ensures their confidence in the regime, keeps them from wanting to leave, and keeps them from wanting to revolt.

If we're talking about 'opening them up' in the 1850s, that's wrong.  We sort of bullied them, but mostly we just scared them.  And not into submission but rather into a state of defensive paranoia.  They brought themselves global trade and power in their own initiative to modernize and preemptively avoid the fate of places like China, which was to be carved up and exploited by Western powers.

&gt; We completely fucked them over but I think what we did saved them in the end.

We completely leveled the entire country with carpet bombing, killed off an entire generation, dismantled a World Empire, and sent them back to the stone age.  That's not saving Japan.  That's like hacking somebody's limbs off and then giving them prosthetics while saying, ""Hey, we *saved* you!""

India, under Jawaharlal Nehru began to move towards a socialist style government, as Nehru believed in the idea that everyone was equal under the government, and a socialist government would be one of the best ways to recognise India's secular ideals. This made India and the USSR natural allies.

The USA at this point in time was operating on a policy of containment. China was already on its way to Mao Zedong's rise, which happened in 1949, and the US was beginning to worry about the spread of communism. The USA's policy in order to counteract this spread by aiding those who were seen as the direct opposition to these ideas. As a result, the US naturally sided with Pakistan. It is important to note that this was hardly a bad choice at the time, as we had not yet seen the full threat of radicalised Islam, and Pakistan and India were on somewhat equal footing. 

However, even after India began to quickly pull ahead, and started the non-aligned movement to counteract the Cold War, the US chose to maintain its close relationship with Pakistan. It projected its power in 1971, and may have gotten involved in that Indo-Pakistan war, had India not asked the Soviets to make it clear that such an act would result in the USSR's involvement as well.

As Pakistan began to fall behind India, it also began to fall prey to fundamentalist Islam. In order to keep Pakistan on the path of progress and maintain its competitiveness against India, the US chose to supply it with economic aid. Although the Cold War is over, and Indo-US ties have warmed considerably, Pakistan is still the US' staunchest South Asian ally. The US infrastructure and military bases there mean that propping up the government with exorbitant amounts of money is cheaper than simply letting it get destroyed. Much of this money that goes to support the Pakistani government is designate as aid for various reasons.

That's highly debatable. Even if they nuke an American city, the response would never be to glass the whole country. First of all, that would be murdering millions of innocent people who had no say in their government's attack. Second of all, that even would not happen in isolation, and at the very least you'd had tons of radioactive fallout landing in South Korea and Japan, possibly even China if the wind is right. Politically this would be a *highly* destabilizing event as it would ensure that total nuclear warfare is now on the table and thus a thinkable option for every other nation. Say the US and China go to war for something; how hard to you think China would believe it could hit the US before it gets the full nuclear treatment? Do you think they'd test it to find out? Or do you think they'd skip a few pages and preemptively nuke the US in an effort to mitigate the US's ability to nuke them? It's impossible to know, but the precedent would have been established: the US nukes countries into dust (even if they might have asked for it). 

&gt;Unlike radical terror groups, NK isn't fighting for an ideal.

Absolutely laughable. They fight for their Stalinist/Maoist hybrid version of Communism, which is their state religion and which is diametrically opposed to everything the ROK stands for. Their cause is unification, just like the South's. Also just like the South, the only scenario they can accept is unification under their form of government and on their terms.

&gt;They want to exist and prosper as a nation.

Yeah, they've clear got that at the top of their list of things to do... Seriously, where are you getting these ideas? The entire purpose of the entire nation is to fight the final war with the South and unify the country, and in the process push out the Americans, which they see as imperialists on par with the Japanese. Their entire society is geared towards that end, and nothing else really matters, at least officially. 

&gt;Lashing out and dying is not an acceptable strategy for them.

It most certainly *is*. Their endgame scenario is making a last ditch all-out assault on the South when it is clear that any other choice will lead to their destruction, whether from within or without. They can't allow a certain level of instability to prevail or else it will have a snowball effect, so when they reach a critical point of instability, for whatever reason, their plan is to pull the rug out from under the forces causing that stability by initiating the final war, which naturally has a unifying effect on populations and which can be used to justify extreme measures while being easy to cover up such measures.

&gt;Their nuclear capability prevents others from taking initial strikes against them: a nuclear retaliation is a serious threat.

Not really. Their massive conventional force has done a great job of preventing initial strikes against them, especially their artillery. Nuclear weapons, for them, are bargaining tools, and they always have been. With nukes at the ready, they can initiate their final war, safe in the knowledge that if things stall or start to go sideways, they can lock down their gains and prevent counter-attack by threatening to nuke stuff if their enemies don't come to the negotiating table. Unlike before, they would likely have the ability to lock down a proper peace treaty. If this happens when Seoul and its surrounding metro area are in their control (which would only take a matter of days to accomplish), then they would effectively win the conflict as the South would no longer be economically, politically, or militarily viable. It would only be a matter of time before the North would then be able to absorb the rest of the South. This plan isn't fool-proof, but they do stand a good chance of getting at least part of it done, whereas before they had nukes they had pretty much no chance of ending a war on their terms before a counter-attack would be managed.

&gt;But for them to take the initiative is basically inconceivable. They can't blow up the rest of the world. A nuclear attack would unite the entire world against them.

For the most part, that's right, and they know that. They have a no first use policy (though who knows if they'd actually stick to that), and they have a lot more incentive to just threaten with their nukes as opposed to use them. But if they did use them, it certainly wouldn't be ""the whole world against them"". You've been playing too much Civ4. Most countries would not care, or would merely condemn their attacks, lacking any reasonable means for retaliating or punishing them. Most European countries can barely maintain their military forces, let alone deploy them to the other side of the planet to fight a massive military force. China wouldn't do anything, nor would Russia. They'd have nothing to gain from that and it would degrade their nuclear strike capabilities if they were publicly condemning North Korea's nuclear first strike (they both have first-use policies in place that help maintain deterrence, as does the US). But for the most part, North Korea is largely immune to global reactions, economically or militarily. South Korea, Japan, and the US are in a position to punish them, sure, but outside that the rest of the world would be unwilling or unable.",-6,0.0816451719577,0.23382077972,0.495014880952,0.293681919271,1.56666666667,1.0,967,0.0495726495726,21.0217391304,0.0291666666667,0.545833333333

Even the slightest deterioration can be catastrophic when dealing with heavy load-bearing structures.  Add in acid rain (also prevalent in China), and the weaknesses are further compounded.

&gt;*I think it's not smart for Beijing to piss of its neighbours with the tough stance in the South China sea, but China has claimed the area since (at least) the 1940s.*

I think this area deserves special emphasis: why now? I have several hypotheses, but the true answer may be a combination of these:

1) Xi Jinping's assertiveness: he's different from his predecessors in terms of distancing away from the ""peaceful rise"" of China, in which leaders try to minimize challenging the global status quo. His leadership style is considered more dominant by China analysts due to the anti-corruption purges that has been happening. Rising relative military strength of the PLA versus other countries and the US also plays a part in this explanation.

2) Fostering nationalist sentiments at home: possibly to take the focus away from current/future economic woes. However, China is noted to be actually quite generous in settling territorial disputes if there are problems at home, instability being a big factor in quick settlements of land disputes with China's neighbours. But: maritime disputes may be different, which China sees as more vital than land disputes.

3) China ""backed into a corner"" in terms of strategic vulnerabilities in the straits: I'm a bit biased towards this explanation over the others. As you say, it is not smart for Beijing to piss off their neighbours with an overly tough stance. However, if a certain line is crossed and China would lose less (strategically) if they adapted a tough stance than the diplomatic penalty, then China would adapt a tough stance. This coincides with the US ""Pivot to Asia"" in terms of timing, so it is likely that China fears that future meekness may allow the US to put a stranglehold on China via control of this region.",12,0.0443204365079,0.263273921116,0.482924107143,0.211325061625,0.965343915344,0.738095238095,309,0.0815217391304,23.7692307692,0.0152557319224,0.45291005291

1659,"Some thoughts

1) China actually took back Paracel islands decades ago, killing some Vietnamese occupiers. Xi is not more assertive than Mao or Deng were. He has been open to making peace with India and is definitely a lot more ""open-minded"" on Taiwan. The rest of the world is simply more sensitive to the same assertiveness China has always had.

2) China has been settling borders for a long time now, with long-running discussions from 1950 through 1991 and ongoing peaceful discussions with Bhutan. It's just that Vietnam and the Philippines have never really been at the negotiating table, whereas Malaysia has and therefore has refused to align with the other two.

3) If you're saying China is being more assertive because the US is being increasingly obnoxious and hypocritical I'd agree. China basically did everything America wanted so now they're reaching deeper to find pretexts to essentially oppose every single thing China does. US whined about currency, China appreciates currency by 5-6% a year. US moves on to Iran, China gets on board about Iran. US complains about North Korea, China gets friendlier with South Korea and attempts to bring NK to the negotiating table. US whines about espionage, then Snowden blows the cover off that. So now America needs to crap out some nonsense about ""freedom of navigation"" as if China has ever considered restricting it in the SCS last 2,000 years or so. Even as far back as 1979 China got the States' (and Thailand's) blessing to smack Vietnam for trying to militarily dominate Indochina in Russia's name.

The big part of this is that China is a signatory to maritime territory laws that state that reclaimed land and artificial islands do not count as territory and cannot be claimed and used to extend an exclusive economic zone or territorial waters. China isn't making these claims yet but when they do, then it will be illegal and that's when it could spark a war. 

The US does freedom of maritime navigation operations through that area all the time. This just means that US flagged governmental vessels transit through the area. It's a show of force to show that the sea lanes are open and navigable. One of these days, China is going to claim this area as their territorial waters which means they are well within their rights (if it were their territorial waters) to sink the American ship. If they don't, they look weak and so does their claim in the area which undermines the governments push to be a world power. If they do, they spark a war that they stand a good chance of loosing, even if they win all the battles (economics will play heavily into that potential conflict).",2,0.0170918367347,0.254956534466,0.499744897959,0.287760529693,0.825,0.625,215,0.0615384615385,26.875,-0.25,0.25

1742,"This is just one example. Another way in which they don't *really* play by the rules is with their currency valuation. Most currencies in the world are ""free floating"" in that market demand for them can increase or decrease their value. 

China practiced currency devaluation for many years by purchasing huge amounts of foreign currency and debt. This kept the value of the currency artificially low, which kept the prices of their goods around the world very low. This is called a ""pegged"" currency because the government picked a value and kept it there through externally influencing the currency market.

More recently, they have switched to a ""controlled peg"" in which the value of the currency is allowed to ""float"" within a certain bracket, but it is controlled through the same means as in the pegged system from exceeding the boundaries of that bracket. Still controlled, but less so, and only at the margins.

There's lots of other ways in which the Chinese economy is falsely propped up, which is why there is a lot of talk about the Chinese bubble collapse. When you see lots of Chinese money in foreign countries buying up property and assets, it's not because they are trying to expand economically, necessarily. It's because anyone who has seen the guts of how that economy works from the inside knows it won't last and wants to get their puffed up Chinese money that they made through various forms of corruption, graft and favoritism into a real economy that is based on real rules.

So while you see a lot going on here, mind you it's a massive country, it's still less then the West. This could partly be explained that you get in the end here due cheap materials/labour/development more money for your buck.

Further I see here a lot of strange ideas about China and construction. You always here about ghost cities and such. I think it's important first to understand ""real estate"" is a big market, even bigger because it's China. What happens in Beijing isn't the same as in some second/third tier city as Maoming South China. Even Beijing it's fucking huge. Then consider real estate is a lot, not just residential but also commercial and offices.

While China certainly is something to be worried about, Li Ka Sjing (HK wealthiest developer) pulls back out of all commercial and office space.* Residential on the other hand he still is going strong in it. It makes sense because China it's vast and still hundreds of millions of people are expected to migrate to the city. Empty blocks today will be full in the near future. Combine that with a strong government which does a lot to change the market into something more affordable it's not unthinkable it's still all fine. The government for example puts restrictions on expensive projects but also forces developers to merge to improve their liquidity. That said there are still developers in perile here, some due corruption, some due shitty projects, some because they were forced into shitty projects by the government. Synocism keeps track of developments and every once in a while he has an article on the property market and current trend in the T40 seems that most prices are flat or even going down, slightly. Then again, China is big, even cities. I live in a city of 17 million people so while maybe the outskirts drop massive in price, the CBD is still very strong.

*Office space on the other hand is really worrysome. I'm a developer/construction guy in the finance world myself. Back home even a shitty office we would demand 150 euro/m2 bare and here I got my office in a top location, the IFC and I pay less then 30 euro/m2 and as a foreign company I'm convinced we still get fucked. Even so, the building less then 100.000m2 out of 250.000m2 is filled and at the same time hundreds of offices are being build including infront of me which is double size. It really makes no sense. Same for commercial space, they aren't super expensive but for the market alright, but the landlords here have the tendency to simply screw over the tenants when they can in hope for a new one after. It's a messed up market.

1774,"&gt; Ghost cities are a myth. 

""Ghosts"" are a myth, yeah, sure. Cities that remain completely empty and are now beginning to fall into disrepair are *not* a myth. 

There was a book published about the whole situation just a few weeks ago, titled ""[Ghost Cities of China: The Story of Cities without People in the World's Most Populated Country](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghost-Cities-China-Populated-Arguments/dp/178360218X). It actually puts the situation in a slightly more positive light, but even it admits that the Ghost cities are a problem.

CNN just did a piece on China's ghost cities [just a couple months ago.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/19/world/gallery/china-tianjin-ghost-city/)

&gt; It generally takes between 10-15 years for them to reach decent occupancy.

That doesn't make any sense. Brand new homes and buildings begin to fall into disrepair after a couple years. They need upkeep and maintenance. Anyone who says that has never worked in construction before. And that's in the west where the build quality is higher. I can't even begin to imagine what a Chinese house would look like after 10-15 years with little maintenance. 

&gt; www.bullionstar.com/blogs/koos-jansen/guest-post-5-chinese-ghost-cities-came-alive/

Well of course some filled up. That was inevitable. Nobody expected every single one of them to remain empty forever. But there are dozens upon dozens, if not *hundreds* of these ghost cities all around China. Just 5 of them filling up is actually less than I thought.

&gt; They're filling about as quickly as is possible.

No, they're not. Worse, they're counting that as part of the GDP growth. That will have horrendous affects on their economy when it all comes to ahead. They might very well be worse off than when they started. When things are not looking so good for other countries' economies, they do all they can to mitigate the fall out. China is basically doing the opposite of mitigation. When the shit hits the fan (and it will, no economy can grow forever, it's impossible) they're going to fall hard.

Then you've got an extra big helping of talking through your hat going on.

&gt;im basing all of this on US fighting china with no other countries intervention. if you want to make it a more realistic scenario, think about what russia would like to do if china and america had themselves a nice big war. 

You mean the Russia that has been threatening the US with Nuclear attack for the last year? The one that is allying with China to establish an investment bank to try and undercut the US Dollar as the world trade currency and replace it with the yuan?  The Russia whose largest petro customer is now China?  The Russia whose fondest desire is the destruction of NATO, and who will be conducting joint military exercises with China?  Gee, I wonder who they'll side with.

&gt; taking chinese territory while china's power was arrayed against the US would be an excellent move, as the chinese cant fight on two fronts against those two nations. 

It is by no means a given that Russia wouldn't side with China

Russia doesn't want Chinese territory, Russia wants European territory.

&gt;china will pretty much certainly be the aggressor, 

Not if history since 1952 is any indicator.

&gt;so russia has rock solid reasoning to get involved. thats a lot of territory and resources to be had, and don't think for a second they wont go for it.

Again, Russia does not want Chinese territory more than it wants European territory.  It is by no means a given that they won't side *with* China.

&gt; also, the US allies will reinforce them,

Less certain than ever, since Iraq and Afghanistan, especially if the US starts it, as demonstrated last year by the UK concerning Syria.

&gt; japan is the perfect place to launch long range bombing and missile attacks.

Which is currently under going a popular movement to force US airbases out of the country.

 &gt;India's position, right on the chinese border, and their disposition towards china, will all most certainly bring them into the war as well, opening up a third front. 

In what way is that certain?  

&gt; you take the 4 most powerful nations, and pit three of them against one,attacking that one from three directions. china has no fucking chance in hell.

But there is nothing that says it would happen that way but your conjecture.  It's just as likely Russia will side with China against it's historical nemesis, and that India will decide it's aims of realizing itself as a superpower are best served by staying out of it.

&gt;also, the US have anti-ship and anti-air missiles and silkworm batteries do not have the range necessary to engage carrier groups,  

 Ship based ones do.  And the land based batteries can reach ships that are at bombardment range- no FO + no satellite guidance means ships will have to close on targets to engage them.

&gt;and torpedo boats are vulnerable to air attacks, 

You don't seem to understand how hard it is to hit a moving target from a moving airplane over an ocean...

&gt;with all those carriers with long range attack capability, torpedo boats will find themselves under attack before they can engage. 

... Or how hard it is to hit a moving target from a moving boat when you're shooting at something you can only see on radar.

&gt; air attacks against carrier groups will have limited success, as the groups have good anti-air defense and can utilize the carrier based aircraft as well. 

Neither Aegis nor Phalanx actually work particularly well, and even if they did,  the Chinese tactic is saturation.  It only takes one exocet to sink a cruiser or destroyer.  As for the carrier based aircraft, the US Navy currently has no air superiority fighter at all- the Tomcats are gone, and as said before, the F-22,and F-35 are sucking hind tit in a big way and will continue to do so for years to come.

&gt;awith the amount of aircraft carriers china has, they have to use land based craft, giving them much less offensive flexibility,they simply cant bring enough firepower at once to cripple a carrier group without losing most of what they attack with or failing altogether. 

This analysis is based on what?  It isn't history or demonstrated capabilities, so what is it?

&gt;these groups can stay outside of effective Chinese naval engagement range, and use SLBMs to effectively engage land targets from outside of chinese land based defense system range.

Not without FOs or satellite guidance they can't.  Without those things, the tomahawk might as well be a catapult flinging rocks.

&gt; if china wants to attack a carrier group they have to leave land based defense behind,

No, they don't.

&gt; without land based aircraft their navy stands no chance of overcoming the US much more mobile and varied defenses. 

...which are no more mobile than China's and demonstrably not that effective.

Imagine a scenario where the English economy collapses and everyone looses their jobs, while the Indian economy booms and becomes the new China. Do you think that these English Indians will think twice before moving to India? They will go there and everyone will treat them like indians and after a while they will fit right in. Meanwhile, you would be stuck in England, perhaps trying to immigrate somewhere else. If you did choose to leave, lets say to india, you would be viewed as a complete foreigner, unlike your english indian friends who would fit in. 

The point being that your culture and ancestry is a lot more difficult to lose than you might think. Sure, asians in England might speak english and embrace english culture, but they will always still be aware of their ancestry and cultural heritage. Just take a look at jews and romani. They have been in Europe for hundreds of years and have still never completely assimilated. They have come very close to doing so, but have not. 

England suffers from the same problems as the states do and its all because of immigration. If an immigrant is shot by police people start asking right away if it was because of the colour of his skin. Of course no one should be shot because of their ethnicity, but in homogenous societies the question is never asked because their is only one ethnicity, one people, and no ethnic tensions. And when different people live together, there is always tension. Just take a look at the former yugoslavia, Lebanon, or Israel. Take a look at Sri Lanka were an ethnic minority (Tamils) went to war, actually trying to carve out a piece of the country even though many of them were 2nd generation migrants that came from southern India.

I actually don't know as much as I'd like about Daesh's demographics, other than that it's predominantly men from the Levant, supplemented with Caucus mercenaries and a small percentage of European/Americans. This is backed up by numbers given by the [CIA/UN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ISIL#Troops_in_Iraq_and_Syria); showing around 15k foreign members, most of which are from Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia.

But we do. Boko Haram has made the news lately as a Daesh-like force in Africa. Hamas (while older) engages in more traditional terrorism, but maintains a similar set of enemies as Daesh (even though they consider Daesh their enemy) and uses similarly callous tactics, the Uyghurs in northern China / India have been growing in strength, and there are dozens of smaller brigades that arise independently but have recently pledged themselves in service of Daesh. Daesh in the Levant may stand out as a more stunning example because of it's history, but the things that cause it to rise as a force in the first place are not unique.

1809,"You've consistently avoided engaging any of the arguments I've made, instead contenting yourself to belittle them without offering any sort of substance. So I will say this: economics as a discipline is bankrupt. It is in no way scientific and lacks any real explanatory power. It makes wild assumptions about human nature and physical reality that are easily contradicted. At it's worst it the pseudo-academic legitimation of horrifically violent government policy. The murder of thousands of innocents in Argentina has the implicit approval of the ideology of Milton Friedman and those advising Pinochet's regime. 

A whole slew of economists are now coming out in support of Keynesian economics and a return to fiscal policy. Even the IMF of all groups is saying we should reconsider Keynes. It is overwhelmingly clear that capitalism exists between the poles of a demand crisis, like the one we are now in and was previously exemplified by the Great Depression era, and of a supply crisis like was experienced in the 1970s. 

It is hard to ignore the fact that this is something that Karl Marx conjectured more than one hundred fifty years ago. He has a far better explanatory record than any mainstream economist, yet we ignore that because it is politically inconvenient.

It is ironic that you would accuse me of having a narrow view of the world when I am advocating explicitly that we connect all the dots and look at the world as a whole. By themselves, the last eleven US presidents being war criminals, top soil being depleted at a breakneck pace with deserts expanding into human settlement, global warming threatening to collapse global ecosystems, countries all over the world engaging in mass surveillance and lurching closer and closer to a police state, or China using half the world's concrete production to build cities that no one will ever live in can all be dismissed as aberration.

I didn't argue that they'd shut down.  Still, if we could minimize the number of people hurt by a recession, or more quickly redirect resources and capital in the midst of one (because even a completely free market system will have recessions)... shouldn't we?  Wouldn't it be better to hurt fewer people?  Wouldn't it be better to NOT cause or exacerbate recessions through bad government policy in the first place?

&gt;Every country has their own military. Because it isn't as large as their own doesn't mean anything.

Yes, it does.

&gt;I actually wish no country had such a large military.

You and the rest of the world.  Unfortunately, as we've seen with Bush's America and Putin's Russia, there are countries out there that are happy to use the barrel of a gun to get what they want.  It's that Europe benefits from looking the other way from the U.S. military, and Putin wouldn't dare fuck with Europe as long as the U.S. military stands at it's side.  

Further, you'll argue that you wish no country had such a large military, but you're clearly in favor of supporting a huge institution of force that will see to it that your way is implemented.  If there were no police to haul away doctors and businessmen working against the laws of your system, they would freely be able to just ignore your regulations.  Does that network of force come for free?  Or do those agents require guns, a paycheck, armor, prisons, etc?

After everyone else already have airstrips and military facilities. Vietnam were building artificial islands on reefs for several years now. Yet somehow when China builds these things after Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines, the US sent warships and spy planes into the region to ""ensure freedom of navigation"".

One notes that these waters are where ~90% of China's maritime trade routes goes through, carrying vital commodities like oil and food, and as such are strategically vulnerable. If any incident (no matter who caused it) disrupted trade in the area, China would be affected the most. The question now is: why would China do anything to harm freedom of navigation in the region? Perhaps they believe it was more in their interests than doing nothing?

Another fact is that the US has made it a common strategy to deploy sanctions/embargoes on its rivals, i.e. China in the past, Cuba, Iran, and Russia today. The US is NOT a signatory of the UNCLOS, again citing freedom of navigation. China and the Philippines when signing UNCLOS expressly stated that existing disputes (like the SCS) do not fall under the treaty. So are those warships really there to enforce freedom of navigation?

Japan's dispute with China is not in the South China Sea, and involve a difference in interpretation over WWII surrender terms for territories. The recent CIA declassified report on the Sino-Indian war placed the blame more on India for provoking war, and the dispute was a historical leftover from the colonial era.

Both sides are unwilling to compromise in strategic purposes, then tactically, Washington will draw closer to a tipping point.

Chinas plans for a rapid expansion of nuclear power plants are insane because the country is not investing enough in safety controls, a leading Chinese scientist has warned.

Proposals to build plants inland, as China ends a moratorium on new generators imposed after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, are particularly risky, the physicist He Zuoxiu said, because if there was an accident it could contaminate rivers that hundreds of millions of people rely on for water and taint groundwater supplies to vast swathes of important farmlands.

China halted the approval of new reactors in 2011 in order to review its safety standards, but gave the go-ahead in March for two units, part of an attempt to surpass Japans nuclear-generating capacity by 2020 and become the worlds biggest user of nuclear power a decade later.

Take a longer timeline view. In 1989, Soviet territory extended to the middle of Germany. Since that time Poland and numerous other countries in Eastern Europe have joined a military alliance with the West moving towards Russia. Russia has been invaded by Napoleon (The French), Hitler (Germany) and many other times. I am not saying it is completely innocent. No country is. All I'm saying is that Russia **cannot** allow to have all the countries on its borders allied with foreign **potentially** aggressive powers. History has taught them this. They must have buffer zones. There is considerable literature and historical examples illustrating this point.

Here is an analogy. 

Would the United States allow Mexico to ally with Russia?
Would Germany allow Switzerland to ally with Russia? 
Would China allow Mongolia to ally with the USA? 
Would England allow Scotland to ally with Iran?

No to all the above. Why? Because it is too large a risk should the circumstances change. The Ukraine is to Russia as Mexico is to the USA, Scotland is to England or Swtizerland is to Germany. It cannot and will not allow it to happen.

1903,"Well, I think that RizzMustBolt was hoping to celebrate the decline of fossil fuels, as our primary energy source, and celebrate the rise of solar power instead. 

However, it appears that RizzMustBolt, might be slightly ahead of schedule in that regard.

--------------------------------

For now, we still need to rely heavily upon fossil fuels, and I believe the USA should continue to supplement their fossil fuels from Canadian sources rather than Saudi Arabian sources. 

In fact, that is exactly what the USA is already doing: Canada now supplies MORE oil to the USA, than even Saudi Arabia. 

This also makes Canada the LARGEST trading partner of the USA, and not China -- China is in second place.

This is surprising to many Americans, as many believe that China is the largest trading partner of the USA, and that Saudi Arabia is the largest oil supplier to the USA... but again, Canada is in 1st place in both of those categories... 

which is probably a great thing, considering how much Canada shares with the USA, in terms of values and culture, as compared to Saudi Arabia and China which have some rather striking value differences/conflicts with the USA.

So ya, I personally believe it is better to send US money to Canada, rather than China/Saudi Arabia.

--------------------------------

But back to the main point of RizzMustBolt: in the end it's probably better for America to keep it's money at home, and rely on solar power, rather than sending that money, even to Canada!

And that day is likely coming. Perhaps sooner than we suspect.

The amount of solar energy that strikes the Earth ever hour is staggering... and will go MUCH FURTHER than fossil fuels, once we perfect solar energy, and it becomes more widespread.

--------------------------------

So while I can't put words in RizzMustBolt's mouth... if I am not mistaken, I think that is what RizzMustbolt wants to celebrate: complete energy independence, and not ""unemployment"" and ""high gas prices"" as you might have accidentally misinterpreted.

The Chinese constantly monitor the location of every American carrier frigate destroyer and likely airboat everywhere in the worlds oceans and where their satellites don't cover Russian satellites will. They are not waiting for war to break out them locate targets. They are tracking targets finger on the kill switch right now.

Thousands of hypersonic missiles some nuclear tipped will lance out from the Chinese mainland traveling at around Mach ten traveling thousands of miles in minutes and will come down on those carrier groups and blow them to bits before they've even had time to change direction to head towards china.

1989,"a brief overview of the M.E

there are two major factions in the M.E. Sunni and Shiia. the US backs the Sunni.
Those Sunni countries being Saudi, Egypt, Kuwait. 
the Shiia being Iran, Iraq, Syria.

It's all about the ability to control access to the worlds most plentiful source of energy. 50% of the worlds oil is sourced from the M.E.  

[Here's a real US policy doc from 1955. Take note of the objectives. Its not mythical. Its there in black and white.  ](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB78/propaganda%20127.pdf)

Americas number one objective in the Middle East: **The availability to the US and its allies of resources, the strategic positions and the passage rights and the denial of such rights and resources to the soviet block.**

So in 1955 the US sought to control the Gulf, to have the ability guarantee its access and to deny access to others.  Oil has not become less important in the prevailing 60 years. 

Formally the USSR was the rival and was seen off with the help of Israel, ( It was what proved Israels worth to the US ) Iran was a client. Iran is no longer a client and so currently the US would like to prevent the formation of  the a [**Shiia crescent,**](http://bintel.com.ua/uploads/images/2014/vol3.jpg) with Iran at its head. 

This crescent would include the Shiia land in Saudi. This is why Saudi and Iran are implacable enemies. Saudi is a US client for protection against Iran. [**If you look and Shiia land in Saudi**](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w26Pl18fmRY/TzFc-rnckII/AAAAAAAAAMg/z8K_-AuXefQ/s1600/Saudi_shia.jpg) you'll note it sits on top of the [**big oil fields**](http://www.reallycoolblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Oil-Gas-Fields-Map.gif). ""Find Shiia find oil"" is a local saying. The Shiia are the potential rivals to US hegemony in the gulf.  

Should Iran succeed in creating such an entity this would be a genuine threat to Americas passage rights and strategic positions in the  region, which as you will recall is America #1 objective in the M.E.

The US will seek to control the M.E. so long as oil powers the world. Control of this resource is a major plank in the USA's super power status.    
I don't think there is a better ally in this ambition to control the gulf than Israel. Israel is a western enclave in the region, is a regional pariah completely dependent on the US for weapons and coverage from UN sanctions and proven ability to kick arab ass. Who would be better?

If you view everything in the M.E. through a Sunni/Shiia/Oil lens all becomes clearer.

The US state dept has called Saudi and the description can be extended to the region [**a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history.**](http://revcom.us/a/090/iran-pt2-en.html)  

[Zbigniew Brzezinski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski) former United States National Security Advisor said America's control over the Middle East [**""gives America indirect but politically critical leverage on the European and Asian economies that are also dependent on energy exports from the region.""**](http://www.idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/GlobalOilPoliticsandtheEnergySecurityintheAsianregion_JNandakumar_110405) . [George Kennan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan) put is as ""Veto power"". Truman's Secretary of Defense James Forrestal noted that [**whoever sits on the valve of Middle East oil may control the destiny of Europe**](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a916768279&amp;fulltext=713240928) and now Asia. 

Control the M.E and you have your foot on the windpipe of the European and Asian economies. relinquishing that control is  unthinkable. (Having permanent military bases in Iraq makes very good sense in this context ) relinquishing control to an Iranian shiia block /China/ Russia is doubly unthinkable. All other potential rivals have to figure Americas control of the oil flow into their calculations. The USA controls the oil. If the USA decides, say China, will not be getting M.E. oil then it can stop the flow. China knows this, the USA knows this. Thus before things get violent China will have to back down. ( China used for example only ) 

BTW China is taking steps strengthen the sea route from the Gulf to China, [**the string of pearls naval ports**](
http://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/string-of-pearls1.jpg)

On the Petro$: The Shiia would not use the petro$. The use of the petro$ means that the US can print dollars to pay for price increases in oil. Industrialized countries without oil, such as Japan EU or China, have to export to the US in order to obtain dollars to exchange for Opec oil; for example, cars in the case of Japan. So America gets oil and services and goods (eg cars) in exchange for pieces of paper. Not only that but Opec's excess dollars were then reinvested in the US and other industrialized countries, thus funding the US budget deficit and reducing US interest rates.

It would be a massive blow to lose the petrodollar. The value of the $ would plunge, the PetroEuro would rise. The Europeans would plunder US assets.


TL:DR if you look at any conflict in the M.E. look at the sides, Shiia and Sunni, I'll find the US will back the Sunni as they have oil and use the Petro$

In fact, both Chinas' claims are derived from the original Nationalist government, a US ally. Naturally, the US have never once worried about ""freedom of navigation"" during this time.

2) The US actually SUPPORTED this dotted-line claim (and Chiang Kaishek) by outright rejecting the Philippines' attempt to annex the Spratlys, by citing how their former colony did not include the islands as part of its territories when ownership was handed over to the US by Spain.

3) Both China and the Philippines are signatories of UNCLOS while the United States is not. However, both countries publicly stated it does not apply to existing disputed areas, i.e. the South China Sea.

4) China's building of military facilities / airstrips in the region FOLLOWS several years of Vietnam artificial island construction &amp; military facilities building, the Philippines having their own airstrip and a makeshift ""base"" in the form of a warship ran ashore, and the Taiwanese stationed at Taiping island which also has an airstrip. In fact, China is the last of the major claimants to do this.

5) Disputed territories are not ""sovereign territories"". By pretty much every measure China/Taiwan's claim is stronger than the others: they have the oldest historical claims, they are the ""most active claimant"", they are the ""earliest effective occupant"", they were the designated party to receive Japan's surrender of the islands, and China was the one who contested French claims back in the colonial era.

Uncertainty around the indigenisation programme, the perceived lack of a free press, the possibility of abandoning the US dollar as official currency, and political uncertainty flowing the end of the government of national unity with the MDC as well as power struggles within ZANU-PF have increased concerns that the countrys economic situation could further deteriorate.

In April 2014 Chinamasa admitted that the country was heavily in debt and that the country desperately needed to come up with policies to attract foreign direct investment. Officially Zimbabwe's debt is $7 billion or over 200% of the country's GDP however this figure is disputed with figures as high as $11 billion being quoted once debts to other African countries and China are included.

2049,"You have it backwards.

China actually has much more rigerous environmental laws on the books than the US but because of China's government structure, enforcing them is hell.

There is a ton of nepotism and lack of oversight amongst party Cadres and because of this enforcing environmental protections just doesn't happen most the time.

How party Cadres rise through the ranks of the party is by meeting ""priority, hard, and soft targets"". Priority targets are things like quelling protests.  If your county/township has no social unrest that looks good and you are available for promotion.  Hard targets are things like growth (I.e. your county/ province has to grow x% this year). Hard targets are preferential but as a cadre they don't matter as much and they don't make or break you like priority targets.  Soft targets are things that look good on paper and can help a cadre get promoted but they just aren't as important.

Why does this matter? Environmental targets are soft targets.  Although this is slowly changing, as it stands, growth and political targets get priority over environmental targets Every. Single. Time.

Furthermore, the act of passing a law in China is an often multiple years long process.  Passing a law in China requires all the relevant ministries to put forward a CONCENSUS DRIVEN LAW. This means the growth and energy ministries must agree with the EPA to get a law passed.  The result?  The laws are often really vague and open to interpretation meaning different ministries can pick and which choose parts of the law to enforce.  This means that sometimes environmental ministries get to punish polluters (like the story in question) but most other times big polluters either bribe an official,are ignored by officials for advancement reasons, or get out of abiding by laws because of a loop hole.

In the end, law enforcement in China is often arbitrary and inconcistent and in NO WAY WHATSOEVER a model to look to.

This of course is open for serious debate as there are serious drawbacks, and very compelling reasons both for and against.  If you had the choice between engaging in wars in the middle east, or polluting locally which do you choose?

The US is in that weird in-between state in my opinion.  Where the regulations have become so much like the IRS tax code, where there are thousands of pointless trivial rules that regulators will come down on you like a ton of bricks for.   Minor shit like missing a barrel of used motor oil and not reporting that it spilled in the back storage lot, while ignoring huge loopholes like allowing fracking wastewater to be disposed of barely treated into local ecosystems.

China I agree will (hopefully) eventually catch up, but it's decades - at best - away at this point.  They have a whole lot more industrializing and pulling people out of abject poverty to do before environmental protection becomes any form of priority.  This is all my opinion of course :)

Never said that it was going to. But that military conflict will bring so much pain to the US that it will be abandoned pretty quick. Forget about how China would do, think about how USA would do after that conflict. All the previous wars instigated by USA had little negative internal impact; war or even localized conflict with China will bring a lot of shit while American economy adapts. 

Do you think people will take kindly to a recession in America? Do you think politicians will ignore it and not go strong with ""current government turned a friendly China into an enemy, and our people now suffer"" rhetoric? Do you think general American population will be content with serious increase in spending (even temporary) just to cater to international power stance of the state?

&gt; The relationship between India and China is strained at best and they have plenty of border disputes with each other. I seriously think you have almost no concept of the current state of geopolitical affairs.

Yes, but it stems from Chinese push into those territories. Do you really think that they will go on pushing for it when US ships stifle their trade marine? I agree that India is more likely to side with US than with China, but then there's Russia, which has been an Indian friend for the longest time, and Russia will undisputedly take Chinese side in that conflict if only to spite USA. At best India will remain neutral. Geopolitical affairs are much more intertwined that simply the current relations of two states, you must take your allies (even temporary ones) stance in consideration too.

After Mao came into power, he pretty much put a stop to all of that due to Communism giving the country industrialization, goals, and a strong military. Mao's downfall was starting a cult of personality after himself (something Marx nor Lenin never advocated at all for Communism) which basically made his chain of command useless as they only cared whether he was happy or not.

I don't imagine the PLAN would file homicide charges against those responsible, like the Philippines has. 

In the past six months the Chinese have added more construction to their claimed islands than any other claimant, with the amount of acres of dredged land in the thousands. This is a fact, not a claim. Many of the other claimants' installations are much older, and do not have a comparable rate of construction in recent months. Every country in the region has tremendous economic integration with China, but Cambodia stands out as having received enormous sums in investment in only the past few years and is one of the very few countries in the region that agrees on China pursuing dialogues on disputes bilaterally instead of multilaterally.  

""and this region is only in the interest of the US because they can pressure China by blocking it."" Yes, because blockading China would only hurt China and somehow not the rest of the world's economy.   Strong logic. It would be political and economic suicide to blockade China in all but the most extreme scenarios.

Yes, because those countries are not actually at war with China, and their animosity is not so intense as to blind them from the huge opportunity in economic cooperation with China.

2) The ""sovereignty"" of disputed territories. You claim falsely that these disputed areas are already the sovereign territories of the ASEAN claimants, as as such under US protection as an ""ally"". This is completely and utterly incorrect.

3) You claim that the trade directly affects American interests and as such requires them to put US warships there. Not only is this a blatant lie, the only reason they are of American interest is because China relies on this trade route for most of its energy supply, and China is the destination of the vast majority of these ships. And as for ""it's impossible to blockade it"", one notes that the USA is currently sanctioning Russia alongside Europe, has employed a decades-long embargo of Cuba, and has sanctioned China in the past. They are perfectly capable to doing so again, even if it hurts them.

attachment, China stated: *China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the
seabed and subsoil thereof (see attached map [of the nine-dash line]). The above position is
consistently held by the Chinese Government, and is widely known by the international
community.*

China actually goes beyond an EEZ, claiming control of all activity (navigation, not just economic exploitation) within a 200  mile zone.  This is what US naval activity is challenging, because it contravenes generally accepted international law.

However, as the article points out, there is also a strategy of deliberate ambiguity and creeping annexation - they take islands an assert control without making a 100% clear (and legally challengeable) claim.

&gt; China has maintained some ambiguity over whether it is using the map of the nine-dash line to
claim full sovereignty over the entire sea area enclosed by the nine-dash line, or something less
than that.37 Maintaining this ambiguity can be viewed as an approach that preserves flexibility for
China in pursuing its maritime claims in the SCS while making it more difficult for other parties
to define specific objections or pursue legal challenges to those claims. It does appear clear,
however, that China at a minimum claims sovereignty over the island groups inside the nine line
segmentsChinas domestic Law on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, enacted in 1992,
specifies that China claims sovereignty over all the island groups inside the nine line segments.38
Chinas implementation on January 1, 2014, of a series of fishing regulations covering much of
the SCS suggests that China claims at least some degree of administrative control over much of
the SCS. 

&gt; Observers frequently characterize Chinas approach for asserting and defending its territorial
claims in the ECS and SCS as a salami-slicing strategy that employs a series of incremental
actions, none of which by itself is a casus belli, to gradually change the status quo in Chinas
favor.39 At least one Chinese official has used the term cabbage strategy to refer to a strategy of consolidating control over disputed islands by wrapping those islands, like the leaves of a
cabbage, in successive layers of occupation and protection formed by fishing boats, Chinese
Coast Guard ships, and then finally Chinese naval ships.40 Other observers have referred to
Chinas approach as a strategy of creeping annexation41 or creeping invasion,42 or as a talk and
take strategy, meaning a strategy in which China engages in (or draws out) negotiations while
taking actions to gain control of contested areas.43",-2,0.0541666666667,0.135211882194,0.307291666667,0.265927288052,0.454166666667,0.9,467,0.103806228374,51.8888888889,0.11953125,0.41484375

No, it is both an argument and a legal insight, in that it informs the reader what UNCLOS's policy on EEZ actually states. It is commonly accepted that rocks and artificial islands do not generate EEZ. China has expressed not a single attempt to contradict this, and them building artificial islands are not done for the purpose of EEZ, but for the purpose of building military facilities.

The basis of your argument is that you said the Philippines have claimed rocks don't generate EEZ, but my citation proves that is only half of the story. The Philippines are reiterating the UNCLOS point that rocks do not generate EEZ, *and claiming that the Spratly archipelago are only comprised of rocks*. As such, they can claim the islands as part of their EEZ projected from their mainland.

The only fact I have stated is that Taiping Island is the only habitable island in the region, and thus according to an acceptable interpretation of UNCLOS the only island that generates an EEZ. All your arguments based on EEZ are incorrect in light of this examination, unless you care to provide a counter-argument to disprove the interpretation I cited.

2206,"Well just to start, there's obviously the issue with Crimea. Russia is largely a landlocked country. The only traversable river in all of Russia is the Volga, and that's often frozen over. Their northern ocean ports are usually hampered by ice and weather, and their port at Sevastapol represents their sole access to the Black Sea and to the Mediterranean. Putin *needs* unfettered access to this port to have any real chance of asserting Russian will over the seas, and to keep goods flowing in out of Russia via water (much easier and cheaper than over land). It's such a critical geopolitical objective that he was willing to flat out invade Crimea immediately following the Kiev protests and the ousting of the pro-Russian Ukranian president, regardless of the consequences.

Secondly, the big picture. The Eurasian Plain that makes up Russia's western border is almost entirely flat, easily traversable land. This is a problem because it is extremely easy to invade Russia along this route. It's is compounded by the fact that Moscow and virtually all of Russia's other industrial/population centers are only a short distance from the Western border (Hitler made it to the gates of Moscow in less than a month). Thus, even a *somewhat credible threat* of the invasion of Russia from the west represents an existential threat to them, and they have to spend inordinate amounts of resources on border defense. Think about how the borders of other countries are set up: China is essentially encircled by inhospitable deserts and the Himalayas. European nations are criss-crossed by rivers and mountain chains that have historically set up dozens of choke points for any potential invading force. The United States has had the grand gift of being separated from any competing powers by the two largest oceans on the planet (and now the most unequivocally dominant naval force the world has ever seen to boot). All of these are luxuries that the Russian nation does not have.

So, Russia has this problem regarding the defense of it's western border that has repeatedly whooped its ass since before the time of Peter the Great. How do you solve this problem? Strategic depth. By bringing as many Eastern European nations under the Russian fold as you can (as the with the USSR), or at the very least subjugating those nations to Russian influence (as with the Russian Empire and today), you build a buffer between yourself and the competing Western powers. Therefore, even if you do get ""invaded"" the enemy will still have a lot of ground to cover before they reach Russian territory, giving them time and space to set up an effective defense.

Other German firms sent 1,027 tons of precursors of mustard gas, sarin, tabun, and tear gasses in all. This work allowed Iraq to produce 150 tons of mustard agent and 60 tons of Tabun in 1983 and 1984 respectively, continuing throughout the decade.

France- 21% glass-lined reactors, tanks, vessels, and columns used for the production of chemical weapons. 

Austria- 16%  heat exchangers, tanks, condensers, and columns for the Iraqi chemical weapons infrastructure

Spain- 4.4%  gave Iraq 57,500 munitions designed for carrying chemical weapons. In addition, they provided reactors, condensers, columns and tanks for Iraqs chemical warfare program

Singapore gave 4,515 tons of precursors for VX, sarin, tabun, and mustard gasses to Iraq.

The Dutch gave 4,261 tons of precursors for sarin, tabun, mustard, and tear gasses to Iraq. 

Egypt gave 2,400 tons of tabun and sarin precursors to Iraq and 28,500 tons of weapons designed for carrying chemical munitions.

India gave 2,343 tons of precursors to VX, tabun, Sarin, and mustard gasses.

Luxembourg gave Iraq 650 tons of mustard gas precursors.

Brazil- About 100 tons of mustard gas

Italy-75,000 shells and rockets designed for chemical weapon

China provided 45,000 munitions designed for chemical warfare

The trade between the United States and the rest of the world consists of things like computers and to say the United States sold chemical weapons to Iraq because Iraq bought computers that they used in their weapons program is grasping and straws and at worst is being blatantly dishonest.

What's ridiculous about it? To me, what's ridiculous is Vietnam making the claim based on their former colonial rulers' claims on the Spratys and Paracel islands (France contested control of the islands with China in the 19th Century). What's ridiculous is that the Philippines made the claim based on ""terra nullius"" which is literally contradicted by every other claim in the region (they made multiple attempts to acquire the island despite China's control over the archipelago even before their independence). What's ridiculous is that somehow when ROC first made the eleven-dash claim decades ago it wasn't an issue with the US (and in fact the US pointed out to the Philippines back then that the Spratlys are not theirs), but after all these years China building artificial islands now ""causes tension"".

They were only the most active atm. Once they made the nine-dash claims they were as ""dormant"" as the rest because something's happening in Manchuria/Manchukuo.

Er, that not really relevant. They were only able to establish themselves in the early 20th Century after the Westerners abandoned it in the 19th Century.

By virtue of convenience rather than ""cementing their claims"". France just had their own country ravaged by war, and they're half a world away.

Wait, there are Moros in the Paracels? What I do know about Spratlys is that most of them are uninhabited. And the few that are like Kalayaan are Filipinos.

&gt;*1946  Republic of China sent warships to claim Itu Aba, the largest of the Spratly Islands and renamed it Taiping Island. The Paracels and Spratlys were handed over to Republic of China control from Japan after the 1945 surrender of Japan, since the Allied powers assigned the Republic of China to receive Japanese surrenders in that area. After WW2 ended, the Republic of China was the ""most active claimaint"". The Republic of China then garrisoned Itu Aba (Taiping) island in 1946 and posted Chinese flags and markers on it along with Woody island in the Paracels, France tried, but failed to make them leave Woody island. The aim of the Republic of China was to block the French claims. The Republic of China drew up The Southern China Sea Islands Location Map, marking the national boundaries in the sea with 11 lines, showing the U shaped claim on the entire South China Sea, and showing the Spratly and Paracels in Chinese territory, in 1947. Later in 1953 the People's Republic of China published the map with 9 lines remained.*

&gt;*1950  After pulling out its garrison in 1950 when the Republic of China evacuated to Taiwan, when the Filipino Tomas Cloma uprooted an ROC flag on Itu Aba laid claim to the Spratlys and, the Republic of China (now Taiwan) again regarrisoned Itu Aba in 1956. In 1946, the Americans reminded the Philippines at its independence that the Spratlys was not Philippine territory, both to not anger Chiang Kai-shek in China and because the Spratlys were not part of the Philippines per the 1898 treaty Spain signed with America. Taiwan's garrison from 1946-1950 and 1956-now on Itu Aba represent the first ""effective occupation"" of the Spratlys out of all the current countries claiming the islands.*

First of all, if you open Pandora's box, don't expect it not to bite you in the ass. This is what happened with Vietnam building artificial islands on disputed lands, thus setting precedent for all other major claimants to do likewise. And China has vastly more financial resources to engage in such faster and bigger than everyone else, which is what is happening now.

Second of all, no Vietnam's land reclamation is not ""reported for years"". There are no 70+ articles on /r/worldnews about Vietnam's island building in 2014 when they started, despite the US clearly have the satellite data to prove this. The US is doing nothing but a selective interpretation of the facts, otherwise known as propaganda.

Third of all, Chinese ""domination"" of the area is by no means a ""threat"" to the US or the West, except in terms of the US's ability to impose a blockade/embargo/sanctions on China via blocking the Malacca straits. As said elsewhere, ensuring ""freedom of navigation"" for the ships in this region is very much in China's interest as the vast majority of those ships are bound for China in the first place, and the only party that will ever threaten this in the region would be the strongest naval power in the world: the United States.

Finally, China is not going to stop construction when they are the LAST of the four major claimants to build military facilities and airstrips in the region. To do so would be against their country's self-interest, and unlike Japan and Korea the US hold no sway over China to force this demand upon them.",12,0.0129166666667,0.109521725478,0.393819444444,0.244373167409,0.348333333333,0.648333333333,326,0.0444444444444,27.1666666667,0.0578125,0.395833333333

I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.

&gt;Upon ratification (7 June 1996)1/:

&gt;In accordance with the decision of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China at its nineteenth session, the President of the People's Republic of China has hereby ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 and at the same time made the following statement:

&gt;1. In accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the People's Republic of China shall enjoy sovereign rights and jurisdiction over an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles and the continental shelf.

&gt;2. The People's Republic of China will effect, through consultations, the delimitation of the boundary of the maritime jurisdiction with the States with coasts opposite or adjacent to China respectively on the basis of international law and in accordance with the principle of equitability.

&gt;**3. The People's Republic of China reaffirms its sovereignty over all its archipelagos and islands as listed in article 2 of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone, which was promulgated on 25 February 1992.**

&gt;4. The People's Republic of China reaffirms that the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea concerning innocent passage through the territorial sea shall not prejudice the right of a coastal State to request, in accordance with its laws and regulations, a foreign State to obtain advance approval from or give prior notification to the coastal State for the passage of its warships through the territorial sea of the coastal State.

And the Article 2 in question

&gt;Article 2 
The territorial sea of the People's Republic of China is a belt of maritime area adjacent to the land territory and the internal waters of the People's Republic of China.

&gt;The land territory of the People's Republic of China includes the mainland of the People's Republic of China and its offshore islands, Taiwan and all islands appertaining thereto including the Diaoyu Islands; the Penghu Islands; the Dongsha Islands; the Xisha Islands; the Zhongsha Islands and the Nansha Islands; **as well as all the other islands that belong to the People's Republic of China.**

&gt;Stop with the relativistic argument. It's simply not valid. The US is the absolute worst when it comes to brainwashing and having insane people living in it. No other country is as horrendous. 

I agree, unfortunately. Just look at our military. Sure, it's one of the strongest among countries, but it's as corrupt as the religious wackos we have here. Our government lies to us, tells us that other world powers are trying to take over the world so we agree to blindly attack. Unfortunately with the rich in our society, throw a lump of cash in front of them and they'll wag their tails like the bitches they are. Our government is the worse and it's the elder people who vote them in. But you can't possibly group all the bad and good people together.

But so is the rest of the world in their own way. Maybe we're crazier, or maybe you watch too much Larry King. Not everyone here is an ass or treats others with disrespect. And I would never try to defend this shit-hole the evils that come from it. We poison our communities with GMOs and without our knowledge. We are given decisions and then they decide for us anyway. How are we suppose to stop that when there are more idiocy than intelligence. I'm sorry you have a generalize view of us and I know it wont change. I don't care, personally.

We all know you hate us, but our government has taught us - in schools mind you - that we are the ultimate superpower, China being behind us of course. This in itself is bullshit. I haven't been proud of this country since 9/11 and probably will remain that way until all the old shitty people die. All I can say is sorry; although a lot of ass-kissing would probably help as well. I suppose replying back is just a way to show you we aren't are all mentally challenged idiots. Here in the US, it's just easier to stay if your born here, doesn't mean that people wouldn't want to leave; our government just makes it damn near impossible. Like you said, though, everyone hates us. How are we to be accepted anywhere else, no matter what our views were? As soon as you hear our accent, the only thing running through your mind would be, 'Crazy, idiotic American.' How do we disprove that if you seem set in your own way?

..and how this relates to sustainable economic growth

While there is a large consensus in the literature on the negative impact of corruption on economic growth, some researchers continue to argue that the effect of corruption on growth is context specific and associated with factors such as the countrys legal and institutional framework, quality of governance and political regime. They conclude that, in some highly regulated countries that do not have effective government institutions and governance systems, corruption can compensate for red tape and institutional weaknesses and grease the wheels of the economy.

This argument does not stand up to scrutiny when looking at the long-term corrosive impact of corruption on economic growth, equality and the quality of a countrys governance and institutional environment. Evidence indicates that corruption is likely to adversely affect long-term economic growth through its impact on investment, taxation, public expenditures and human development. Corruption is also likely to undermine the regulatory environment and the efficiency of state institutions as rent-seeking distorts incentives and decision-making processes.

Not only does corruption affect economic development in terms of economic efficiency and growth, it also affects equitable distribution of resources across the population, increasing income inequalities, undermining the effectiveness of social welfare programmes and ultimately resulting in lower levels of human development. This, in turn, may undermine long-term sustainable development, economic growth and equality

http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/answer/the_impact_of_corruption_on_growth_and_inequality

China's growth has more to do with the exploitation of it's large population of unskilled workers and poor long term economic policies which China is reaping the benefits of now.

&gt; [Jay Batongbacal leads off with Arbitration 101](http://amti.csis.org/arbitration-101-philippines-v-china/), a terrific primer on what has happened so far in the arbitration and what we might expect from the South China Sea case in the coming months. Batongbacal reviews the events that led the Philippines to initiate arbitration in 2013 and explores the legal basis within UNCLOS for it doing so. He explains how the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) has proceeded with the case despite Chinas refusal to participate and discusses the submissions that have taken place so far, including the Philippines Memorial submission in March 2014, and the relevant papers released by China, Vietnam, and the United States in December 2014.

&gt; ... Batongbacal reviews the core of the Philippines argument in the case: Chinas nine-dash line claim is inconsistent with UNCLOS; China has illegally occupied or controlled eight features in the South China Sea and claims excessive maritime entitlements from them; China has unlawfully claimed or exploited resources within the Philippines EEZ and Continental Shelf. He also summarizes Chinas counter-arguments in its December 2014 position paper: The arbitration is a dispute over territorial sovereignty over features in the Spratly Islands and Scarborough Shoal, which UNCLOS does not address and the Tribunal cannot solve

&gt;*The nine-dotted line was originally an ""eleven-dotted-line,"" first indicated by the then Kuomintang government of the Republic of China in 1947, for its claims to the South China Sea. After, the Communist Party of China took over mainland China and formed the People's Republic of China in 1949. The line was adopted and revised to nine as endorsed by Zhou Enlai.*

It is an official claim of Chinese control over the Paracels and Spratly islands, that can be traced back to 3rd century (Jin Dynasty), then Southern Dynasty, then Sui, then Tang, then Song, then Yuan and Ming etc via archaeological remains and ancient records.

In the 19th century, Qing China contested various Western powers over the ownership of the islands (being a sovereign state while Vietnam and the Philippines were colonized). China defended its ownership against the likes of Germany, Britain, France etc.

When Qing collapsed and the Republic of China was formed, China focused on defending its claims on Paracels over that of Spratly. During WW2, Japan conquered those islands, and after its defeat the ROC were given control of the territories (Paracels and Spratly) Japan surrendered. The ROC also took effort to establish a base on Taiping Island, the largest island of the Spratly archipelago. In 1947, China officially declared its control via the eleven-dotted line (turned into the nine-dotted line when the CCP inherited the claim).

The Philippines and Vietnam seized the opportunity to take control of what they could in 1950s-70s when ROC lost the civil war and withdrew their ships, an act that was long planned for as they had their eyes on the waters for a long time.

In short, Chinese claim is strengthened by the fact that they are ""most active claimant"", most extensive historical records of ownership/control, ""earliest effective occupant"" from 1947-50 and 1956-now.  The Philippines and Vietnam on the other hand have none of these things, and rely on stealing territories that were formerly under Chinese control and then justifying their actions by portraying themselves as victims.

Considering the Chinese claim (before the 19th century) precedes the Philippines' status as an independent country (1946 Treaty of Manila), is it really that much of a surprise that the Philippines' EEZ (UNCLOS signed and ratified 1982-84) overlaps the Chinese claim?",-1,0.052380952381,0.244127712891,0.26130952381,0.294303186939,1.1125,1.0,382,0.082304526749,27.2857142857,0.0,0.0625

Problems with it.

1. the 9 dotted line is much bigger than the Paracels and Spratlys.  It covers over 80% of the South China (West Philippine, or maybe East Vietnamese?) Sea.  Why not just claim the islands, and leave the sea alone, if China does not want to claim any EEZ?

2.  Did China really historically control  *all* of the Spratlys and Paracels?   Or does it have a claim to just some of the islands?

3. When you  refute any Chinese claim to an EEZ (ie, claiming that only Taiwanese controlled Taiping is entitled to an EEZ) , are you saying that China is abandoning all claims on oil and fishing inside other countries' EEZs?  If so, why does the 9-dash-line extend into the EEZs?

4.

If we can escape earth there will be so much diversity over time that it will dwarf anything that could possibly have occurred on Earth without us.

So? The claim was made before UNCLOS. China on the ground has not acted to enforce their claim over the entire sea, as you should be well aware.

&gt;*Did China really historically control all of the Spratlys and Paracels?*

All of them. This is a problem?

&gt;*are you saying that China is abandoning all claims on oil and fishing inside other countries' EEZs?*

No, China has explicitly excluded the South China Sea from their ratification of UNCLOS, as such EEZ is irrelevant. One notes that the Philippines are also arguing that the Spraty islands (Taiping included) do not have any EEZ and they are claiming the islands based on the EEZ of their mainland, but they are incorrect as Taiping fits the definition of ""habitable island"" under UNCLOS. Also, one cannot claim territory based on EEZ. The ownership of Taiping is in reality just an extra point in China's favour in terms of their claim, and refers back to their historical ownership of the archipelago.

Next, bilateral negotiations with a country much more powerful with more leverage (military power, economic power, sheer number of people power) is a mistake. Bilateral negotiations would give China an unfair advantage cause they simply have more leverage. It would also lend credence to China's bullshit nine dashed lines claim because they'd first have  to acknowledge that china's claim has any grounding in international law in order to start negotiations on how to divide the sea.
International court is better for all parties involved. No unfair leverage, only historical and effective occupation claims. According to you China would win easy cause other claimants claims are BS. And it is not 'China's affairs' it is a global multilateral affair. Many countries depend on  SCS for transportation, food, resources.

Bilateral negotiations with China are a throwback to the tributary system:

Korea's trade volume with China is larger than its trade with the US and Japan *combined* and exports reached new highs after the Senkaku-Diaoyutai debate flared up.

2444,"To some extent, but there are a variety of more or less antagonistic ways to do it, depending on what message you want to send.  For example, Russia violated NATO air space with it's fighters several times, in threatening ways; yes, testing reactions was part of the point, but so was sending a message, especially as a response to the trade embargos.  Or, for another example, the US and China frequently do this over the South China Sea, both in a way that sends a message; China claims it as it's own territorial waters and says no one else has  a right to be there, but the US and other Asian nations in the area consider it to be international waters, so both sides make a diplomatic point by flying their planes there.

For instance, people here believe that China is unilaterally building islands. When that is proven wrong, they move to China bullying its neighbours. When it is shown they don't do much worse than what is done by other claimants, they move to how their claim is ""ridiculous"" and far from the Chinese mainland, which is funny considering the claim existed before some of the other claimants did as independent countries.

2448,"No, Vietnam's claim is nowhere near as good as China's. Did you bother to read your own link? They claim historical continuation of ownership, which is already contradicted by Chinese ownership. They claim that colonial France ""defended"" their territory, which is again wrong because that's like HK claiming parts of the commonwealth, and Vietnam actually fought a war with France for independence, during which France did not control the disputed islands.

They are not ""most active claimant"", not ""earliest effective occupant"", or any other things. They started enforcing their claims only after China loses its grip on the islands due to civil war, and if their claim is ""equally as strong as China's"" they would've been chosen to recieve Japan's surrender of the islands.

How is bilateral negotiations a mistake? China has been extremely generous with all of its bilateral negotiations thus far, and if you believe China bullied its way to get deals that gives away more than 50% of their claims, then is China really something to worry about?

International ""norms"" are set by countries that did not include China: China has ratified some but for UNCLOS rejected the application to the disputed waters. Again, China is not going to set a precedent for multilateral negotiations, because obviously the US will try as hard as it could to meddle.

Freedom of navigation is priority one of China. The maritime trade route is the source of China's critical oil imports.

2450,"These islands are literally land. They also obviously belong to the Chinese. Thus they are no longer in international waters. The islands come with a new Chinese economic exclusion zone that pushes back the zone of international waters.

I think china just found a clever way around the rules the USA unilaterally enforced on the world for the last hundred years. Nothing they are doing is illegal under international law. The USA created laws designed to benefit themselves and handicap rivals. Now China has become powerful enough to literally create new lands in the middle of the ocean and it's too late for the USA to change the rules again.

I bet those islands will serve to push back American carriers from the Chinese mainland as the Chinese will stock them with carrier killing missiles so they can reach out and touch American naval groups even further now. I bet they'll also put Russian anti air tech on them maybe a few dozen ICBMs on each one radar and early warning and surround them with Chinese naval groups and submarines.

Well, there is such a thing as the World Court to decide these types of things. Of course, the US refuses to abide by the World Court since they ruled in Nicaragua's favor in our 1980s war on the democratic government of Nicaragua.

Either way, the way to solve this issue is by sitting around a table and having diplomats argue while they order expensive lunches. Sending in the US Navy to harass China is military madness, but it does fit in with the mindset behind the US' ""Asian Pivot.""
