The drafts of the agreement are kept secret from the public--just like they are for every international agreement, and for good reason.  The agree-upon sections are available to Congresspeople.

Meanwhile, under Regan, the deficit ballooned. Obama has been far more fiscally ""conservative"".

DEBT as a % of GDP under Reagan was HALF of what Barry has it at.

Additionally - funny obama taking credit for reducing spending when he shut down the govt trying to fight sequestration....which actually had an effect on spending and deficits.

You need to understand the difference between deficit and total debt.  Deficit is for the year, total debt is the accumulation of yearly deficits.

Context matters - Reagan increase spending relative to the size of the economy 50% of GDP 

From Politifact:

&gt;Obama said since taking office the country has seen ""our deficits cut by two-thirds.""

His claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point.

The claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The countrys spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the countrys biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare.

The deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit.

That's a little misleading FYI. [Here's the wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) with Primary voting in the run-up to 2008.

The following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:

* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, 

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%

Now, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):

* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% 

* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   

* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, 

* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%

So, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It's hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it's an insanely large difference.

Secondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus ""not-Hillary"" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary's level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains ""flat"" she'll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he'll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). 

Additionally, the ""not Hillary / Bernie"" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she's included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She's [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). 

If I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the '08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially ""Warren Lite"". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.

So where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)

-----------------------

**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama ""only"" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he'll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she's doing a better job positioning herself as the ""populist"" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn't chip away at her initial polling numbers.

187,"I think it stems from a place of ignorance. These individuals likely possess little understanding politics, economics and history. They display a pattern of rejecting science and reason while being compelled by the emotional rhetoric of their charismatic leaders. They often will believe things heard from unreliable and deliberately manipulative sources. The ability to critically analyze events and policies and connect them to their consequences is seemingly absent. Most are very religious and are more concerned with the social issues rather than the fiscal or diplomatic ones. For these people, voting for a politician who shares (so they claim) their values is more important than voting for one that will actually protect their interest. People also tend to attribute good character to those individuals who more closely share their beliefs. Another reason is that people like simple heuristics: ""I'm a Republican, that means I vote for a Republican. Obama is bad, everything he does is bad."". Then there are the cultural aspects. They most likely share the same political affiliation as their parents. There's pressure from society to either vote and think a certain way or face rejection and judgement from peers. The politicians are also very cunning. They pass policies that ensure they get reelected such as voter ID laws that prevent specific demographics from casting their vote. These demographics, not surprisingly, tend to vote more liberally. And here's where I get speculative. I think a lot of these political leaders and their powerful supporters want to keep the majority of the population poor and stupid. Poor so they don't have the resources to fight back and stupid so that they don't realize that they should. The poor and stupid are easy to manipulate, they are mindless consumers, and are easier to ship off to fight wars. I don't think it's some remarkable coincidence that public schools are so underfunded, that higher education is so expensive, that abortion and contraception is so vilified, and that the income inequality is so extreme.

Meet John Napier Tye, a section chief in the State Department.

&gt;Issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 to authorize foreign intelligence investigations, **12333 is not a statute and has never been subject to meaningful oversight from Congress** or any court. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), **chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said that the committee has not been able to sufficiently oversee activities conducted under 12333.**
  

&gt;No warrant or court approval is required, **and such collection never need be reported to Congress. None of the reforms that Obama announced earlier this year will affect such collection.**  


&gt;if U.S. citizens disagree with congressional and executive branch determinations about the proper scope of signals intelligence activities, **they have the opportunity to change the policy through our democratic process.** But the White House counsels office told me that no, that wasnt true.   


&gt;Even after all the reforms President Obama has announced, **some intelligence practices remain so secret, even from members of Congress,** that there is no opportunity for our democracy to change them.
  

&gt;Public debate about the bulk collection of U.S. citizens data by the NSA has focused largely on **Section 215 of the Patriot Act**, through which the government obtains court orders to compel American telecommunications companies to turn over phone data. **But Section 215 is a small part of the picture** and **does not include the universe of collection and storage of communications by U.S. persons authorized under Executive Order 12333.**  

  

Domestic spying began with, and still derives its power from **Executive Order** 12333, signed by Ronald Reagan in 1981, and then expanded again by a President **alone,** with Executive Order 13355 in 2004, and again expanded by **Executive Order** 13470 in 2008, both by George Bush. No Congress, no press, just Presidents creating new intelligence policies.

We get anomalies like Sanders once in a while, but the rest of the politicians will stay the same, as will the broken system. As long as that system remains in place as is, politics will remain corrupt.

Who will be the people who will cause a peaceful ruckus? Perhaps his supporters, sure.

&gt;Issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 to authorize foreign intelligence investigations, **12333 is not a statute and has never been subject to meaningful oversight from Congress** or any court. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), **chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said that the committee has not been able to sufficiently oversee activities conducted under 12333.**
  

&gt;No warrant or court approval is required, **and such collection never need be reported to Congress. None of the reforms that Obama announced earlier this year will affect such collection.**  


&gt;if U.S. citizens disagree with congressional and executive branch determinations about the proper scope of signals intelligence activities, **they have the opportunity to change the policy through our democratic process.** But the White House counsels office told me that no, that wasnt true.   


&gt;Even after all the reforms President Obama has announced, **some intelligence practices remain so secret, even from members of Congress,** that there is **no opportunity for our democracy to change them.**
  

&gt;Public debate about the bulk collection of U.S. citizens data by the NSA has focused largely on **Section 215 of the Patriot Act**, through which the government obtains court orders to compel American telecommunications companies to turn over phone data. **But Section 215 is a small part of the picture** and **does not include the universe of collection and storage of communications by U.S. persons authorized under Executive Order 12333.**  

  

Domestic spying began with, and still derives its power from **Executive Order** 12333, signed by Ronald Reagan in 1981, and then expanded again by a President **alone,** with Executive Order 13355 in 2004, and again expanded by **Executive Order** 13470 in 2008, both by George Bush. No Congress, no press, just Presidents creating new intelligence policies.

The ACLU and Yale Law School are preparing to sue the US gov over this exact executive order, because Congress cant do a thing about it.

The reality is that the former Obama campaign organization has been more or less handed over to Clinton.  The email lists.  The database of supporters.  The donors.  The Super PAC organizations.  Her reward for serving dutifully as Secretary of State is that she gets the very formidable Obama political machine to join with the Clinton political machine, and if you seriously think enough of those people are going to defect and join Sanders' campaign then my guess is you live in one of the states where recreational weed is legal and you've been smoking some really good stuff.",1,0.130808080808,0.117942033411,0.35,0.247743272808,0.333333333333,0.666666666667,114,0.0434782608696,14.25,0.111994949495,0.279861111111
256,"&gt;  everyone in the media and the pundits and everyone who keeps your mind set of thinking the people who would vote for the old way thought obama would be a complete failure.

That's not true at all. Obama actually received a [fairly significant level of establishment support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Endorsements). By this time in 2007, [he was polling](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html) within 10 points of Clinton. Along with Edwards, and Clinton, Obama was treated as a top rate candidate, though Clinton had been considered the presumptive nominee from the start. And on that note, [Clinton's position in 2016 outpaces her position in 2008](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-iowa-2016/); the ""inevitability"" of her in 2008 is not at all comparable to the same claim for 2016. (Not that the last bit is particularly relevant, but but it could be later in the discussion and I wanted to pre-note that.)

&gt; lastly i dont think rubio has a chance at all. the republican's have long since been using the southern strategy and they've attracted a base that is a fairly racist. they're not going to vote a latino, even if he's from their party, to presidency.

I think this is a misapplication of assessments. Republicans have shown they're more than willing to elect minorities that follow the party-line on issues. Bobby Jindal, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Brian Sandoval, Susana Martinez, Mia Love, Will Hurd, Allen West, Ral Labrador...

And that's not touching on the big unelected republicans that get lots of support, like Ben Carson, Collin Powell, or Condoleezza Rice. Or hell, look at Romney -- he didn't lose any noteworthy support with evangelical voters despite being a Mormon.

Republicans will happily support people of whatever background -- just as long as they're ""right"" (to the republican voter) on the issues. Racism today is systemic and passive, rather than individual and active: where the republican party is racist is via their policy stances and as a magnifier of already existing dislike -- not through large-scale inherent outright rejection of someone for their race or ethnicity.

On the flipside, I'm not going to argue that Rubio is going to *gain* any significant hispanic support just because he himself is hispanic. He'll be opposed by the majority of them for the same reason the majority of republicans would support him: his policy stances.

&gt; as for rubio's charisma i'm not so sure. he has the same charisma as romney, he's robotic.

Sorry but I can't agree with that at all. Watch Rubio in an interview or speaking. I don't agree with him or even like him, but he's clearly a politician that knows how to speak well for himself. Romney had no ability to relate to people or even pretend he could relate to people: almost every time he spoke he reinforced some negative perception of him. Rubio doesn't suffer from that. [Charismatic is perhaps the single most often used adjective to describe Rubio](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/young-marco-rubio-stuns-media-with-his-charisma.html) -- and it's not by accident.

For my $0.02, as a progressive: Rubio is likely the most dangerous republican in the race right now. He has a path to the nomination, and would be able to make a politically valuable contrast with any plausible democratic nominees. He's not really significantly less conservative than Cruz or Paul, but he's able to *talk* like he is -- and convince people that he is, too.

And asking for similar media coverage for both current candidates doesn't mean glowing/positive coverage.  It should be honest and adversarial.  Obama was trailing Hillary by over 30 points in 2007, by your explanation, he should have received much less attention.  Yet the media was in the tank for him and helped push him to the nomination.  It's worth noting that the nomination process isn't a truly democratic function, with the arcane awarding of delegates, caucuses and superdelegates.  Obama received less votes than Hillary in 2008 so purely focusing on polling doesn't tell the whole story.    
  
It's not the media's job to be gatekeepers and reduce the campaign to their decided candidates.  If the story is the Democratic nomination, they should cover the declared democratic candidates.  It is reasonable to have a cutoff of how many candidates to cover, for example the candidates polling at least 5%.  There are only two official candidates, so the relevant polling should only have a choice of those two candidates, of which Bernie has a significant draw.  Nationwide, it's not unreasonable to only cover the party nominees who have received enough signatures to be placed on the ballot in enough states to have have a mathematical chance of winning the electoral college.  That would limit coverage and debates to just 4 national parties.   Also, I did not even say unequivocally that any and all candidates should be given equal attention, just that in ONE race with just TWO candidates.  
  
If you think Hillary is such an overwhelming favorite, then they should not even cover the nomination process at all.   If it's such a sure shot and it's 9 months from the first caucus/primary and 18 months from the national election, don't even bother covering it.    
  
The establishment media lies to their audience through narrowly defining the acceptable spectrum of debate and ignoring the views they declare ""extreme"" that a significant percentage or even a majority of Americans identify with.  It's piss poor journalism that makes races covered by bullshit factors like who's ""electable"", who's too old, who's likable, who had less gaffes and who ""energizes their base.""   
  
Fair and honest media would instead shape their focus by using a very simple questioning string: What are the top issues for voters, what are each candidate's specific position and record on each issue, where is there a difference, then highlight/debate those differences and hold the candidates to account when they violate their pledges.

Yes Obama had more energy, policies that were much more acceptable than Hillary's. Respect from a connected generation that jumped in to fight the Rovian dirty tricks. Unless you can energize your base you can't do that. Kerry didn't and he lost to the most unpopular president since Hoover. Just like Hillary he was ""the most electable candidate"" according to the MSM. 

Unless the DEMs get someone who can fire up the base it will be another election like Kerry vs Bush where Kerry ( with the same supporters as Hillary, same upper crust donors as Hillary, same inability to debate like Hillary) got crushed by Bush.

Honestly a young lady I know, Junior in college, didn't know what Napalm was, when I made a reference to her killing the shit out of my grass.  That's just one example out of many.

People are just simply too stupid to know, look out for, or VOTE in their best interests.  I came from a family highly interested and involved in politics, but most of the adults I know, don't vote.  They don't vote for either party when really they can't afford not to!  I'm voting so they don't get their food stamps cut off and their kids will starve.  WTF?  

It's a culture of apathy.  We all know there are major problems but we do nothing to correct the problem... it's like ""oh well, someone else's problem, until it directly involves your life.  Even then people are pissed for a minute and then go back to their business. 

Propaganda rules.  I don't fall victim to it because all my life I have questioned EVERYTHING and EVERYONE.   I knew that in 2000 Gore won the election.  I knew in 2001 that Iraq did not have Weapons of Mass Destruction.   Just because they say it on the boob-tube (television) does not make it so.  Just because a politician is telling it to you, does not make it so. 

Money and big business rule.  As was alluded to in the response to your comment.   Big business LOVES Hillary.  She's almost like having a Republican except for on a few Social issues that keep the rabble at odds with each other.  Hillary running against any Republican is a win/win for big business. Sort of like Obama, or Mr. Goldman Sachs as I like to call him.   All these political should be forced to wear their sponsors logos on them like NASCAR drivers.  That way we can see who they are really representing. 

What can you do?  Vote for Bernie Sanders.  He might not win the Primary, but I hope he does. If he doesn't, still don't vote for Hillary.  Whip the DNC in to line like the Tea Party whipped the GOP. Let them know that you won't vote for any Corporate owned asshat that they throw up there.  Vote for the Candidate that most represents your views.  In my case that would be the Green Party-- but who ever

Will the DNC lose?  Maybe, maybe not-- but don't give them your vote just because ""the lessor of two evils"" excuse.  Make no mistake the lessor evil is still EVIL.... that's how corporations have been holding us.  With fear.  You have to figure, the worst President on the planet is only going to be around for at MOST 8 years.  Hopefully 4 if a good, honest, for the people option is given.  Ride it out.  

Finally there was a theory in old Social Work teachings that Welfare was a bad thing because it gave people just enough to scrape by on that they did not rise up for equality.  I believe that to be true.  Poor people don't vote, but I bet starving people would vote.   Sad to think that's what it will probably take to get a lot of people to the polls, but if that's what they need, I am personally prepared to give it to them.

Right. Part of that honesty means saying that a socialist from vermont is probably not going to win the democratic primary. 

&gt; Obama was trailing Hillary by over 30 points in 2007, by your explanation, he should have received much less attention. Yet the media was in the tank for him and helped push him to the nomination. It's worth noting that the nomination process isn't a truly democratic function, with the arcane awarding of delegates, caucuses and superdelegates. Obama received less votes than Hillary in 2008 so purely focusing on polling doesn't tell the whole story.

The malpractice there was the press following Hillary after she basically lost because they wanted to keep the horse race up, not whatever press happened before Iowa. As you note, the primaries aren't like the general election, and the Obama campaign took *full* advantage of this. By the end of February they had the nomination locked up but the press didn't want to admit it because it served them to cover the horse race. 

&gt; There is no justification for the silent treatment Bernie is receiving.

I'm guessing that a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters don't remember what Obama ran on the first time. It was ""Hope and Change"" -- he was saying many of the same things as Bernie Sanders. He wanted to fundamentally change how government worked. He wasn't as populist as Sanders, but there much of the same starry-eyed dreaming that Obama ""cared about the poor and middle class"" and ""we would finally have someone who got it."" I still remember reading some young voter who was filled with pride that she voted for Obama and she felt invested in fixing the future!

Well, Obama got a few things done, but does anyone *really* think he delivered on his promise of ""Hope and Change""? Now, most people will scream at this point, ""REPUBLICANS BLOCKED HIM!!""

I think what many people don't realize is how dirty a game politics really is. It isn't new. People have been dead-set against a lot of big programs that got passed, but Presidents have got them passed because *they weren't afraid to get dirty*. They threatened, they cajoled, they bartered, and they GOT THINGS DONE. The left HATED Reagan, yet he got things done. To be an effective President, you have to be willing to do what's necessary.

When has Bernie Sanders ever demonstrated that kind of leadership? He talks a lot, but when has he ever, through sheer force of personality, gotten something done? Obama did a LOT of talking, but a President has to be a tough SOB otherwise they're roadkill.

For a long time, we've been without a way to come together to make change.  I think many of us expected Obama to speak on our behalf more.  Unfortunately he compromised too easily and did too much negotiation behind closed doors -- excluding us in the process.  

Obama did not use the bully pulpit near as much as I hoped.  Consequently voters didn't even know when or how to put pressure on their obstructionist Representatives and Senators.  He often doesn't act like he needs citizens to help.

Examples:  A public option for insurance -- Obama didn't ask us to help push for that; he just gave in.  Trade agreement -- he treats it as if it's none of our business and that we should trust him to put together an agreement with only the input of corporations and a few other powerful people.

Hillary is far too cozy with Wall Street, and has what many in the public would consider a skewed opinion on poverty. She herself thinks like a wealthy person, the 1%, and cannot hide these attitudes. Where Obama gave her an opportunity to flesh out her resume as Secretary of State, Benghazi occurred on her watch and any Republican opponents will not let this rest. And despite public appearances as a married couple and with a new grandchild, the specter of Bills constant and continuing sexual exploits is one such factor.

&gt;This reflects on Hillary, as it begs the question of why Bill is constantly seeking sex outside of his marriage. Whats wrong with Hillary? And why didnt she divorce him years ago? The conclusion is that her ambitions, that it is her turn to be President, are driving her decisions. Bill is a consummate politician, helping any candidate on the campaign trail, as is well known. Hillary hopes that if they hide his escapades, the past will fade away and she can finally be anointed President. Now it is clear that the opposite will happen. Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker were involved in mutual charities with Epstein, but only Bill went to the Caribbean island. No denials or objections will suffice.

One Hundred and Forty-one republicans and a small handful of democrats (all male) voted yes on a bill whose only purpose was to steal the protection of medical law and the triage system from pregnant women alone.

The bill would have allowed doctors or hospitals abandon pregnant women to die from ectopic pregnancies or complicated miscarriages.  Please keep in mind that in these situations the embryo is already dead or dying and won't make it if the mother dies.

The bill stalled because Obama promised to veto it.  If a republican were president, he wouldn't have agreed to veto it and it may well be in effect now.

While the federal minimum wage was only $3.35 per hour in 1981 and is currently $7.25 per hour in real dollars, when adjusted for inflation, the current federal minimum wage would need to be more than $8 per hour to equal its buying power of the early 1980s and more nearly $11 per hour to equal its buying power of the late 1960s.

382,"**Disclaimer:** On occasion, I have been accused of being slightly to the left of Gandhi, although I prefer to think I'm more of a pragmatic, socially minded, realist.

Since it's important to understand opposing viewpoints *before* deciding they're wrong, I try to listen, particularly to the more logical (or at least logically consistent) conservative voices to at least make sure I don't dismiss them as just being idiots. Here's my best attempt at playing devil's advocate.

**Obstructionism (regarding Obama):** In an environment where the voters have been convinced to see things in an us-versus-them paradigm - red versus blue, conservative versus liberal, good versus bad, it's easy to begin with one of the following premises:

1. Obama has malevolent intentions and actually wants to see the United States harmed.

2. He is so fundamentally wrong that everything he wants to implement would damage the United States.

3. He must be thwarted politically because a victory for him is a loss for my team.

So if you've got conservative relatives (like I do) who subscribe to one or more of these premises, it doesn't do you any good to point out that the Republicans in congress have used the filibuster (okay, prevented a cloture vote) at a historic level in blocking Obama's efforts. They see that as a good thing. To them, me complaining about that makes about as much sense as complaining about the California Board of Parole repeatedly denying parole for Charles Manson.

**World view:** Aside from the partisan issues, there is a huge world view difference. Conservatives see liberals as being prone to hand-wringing and worrying about things that just shouldn't be that big of a deal. In short, Liberals are a bunch of pussies. Liberals make a big fuss over whatever the current hysteria is, and soon enough, there's a whole slew of new rules we have to worry about. When someone dismisses these rules as merely being *politically correct*, it's easy to hear the disdain and resentment they feel for being told they need to change because of someone else's values.

In addition to being pussies, many conservatives believe liberals in the government are corrupt. In much the same way that conservative politicians are suspected of kowtowing to their donors' priorities, many conservative voters believe that the push for spending to combat Climate Change is being driven by those who would benefit financially by such efforts. Additionally, they believe that new laws would be restrictive (carbon emission standards, etc.,) and hurt big businesses, who as everyone knows, are Job Creators.

**Mistrust of Science:** Finally, there is a prevalent mistrust/dislike of science for many conservative religious fundamentalists. When your religion makes up such a huge part of your community and self identity, it's natural to resent or dislike the people and the methods that contradict many of your sacred beliefs. If I draw strength and reassurance from the belief that I am one of the chosen favorites of the omnipotent creator of the universe, I'd have a lot invested in the pillars of that belief structure. If I believe that God created mankind as described in the Bible and as taught to me since I was a child, it would be hard for me to be accepting of someone who told me otherwise. It would be hard for me to look into evolution critically and actually evaluate it for myself, because the truth is, I really wouldn't want to know. I'd be terrified of what it would mean if I found compelling evidence that part of my religious foundation was built out of lies or ignorance. And so I'd view science not just as confusing and inaccessible, but as a general assault on God. To me, those people (scientists) wouldn't be looking for answers about the universe; they'd be trying to disprove God.

In addition, if I believed the omnipotent creator of the universe were running the show, it wouldn't make sense that he'd let me ruin the whole shebang by driving my Hummer too much. So that would be another case of my religion telling me one thing and scientists and liberals telling me something that contradicts.

If gays can have their marriages recognized by the state, it stands to reason that so can any other couple. Siblings will get married. Parents and children will get married. If you're going to keep that illegal, you'll have to explain why in a manner that is congruent with your positions on gay marriage. You can't. It's going to happen.  

The future where the government offers to recognize any and all pairings between two people as a ""marriage"" is one in which the highest authority in the land has declared ""as far as we are concerned, there is no connection between marriage and reproduction"". Marriage, as a legal institution primarily for the purpose of raising the next generation, is thereby abolished. It is a foundational social institution for doing society's most important work, and you want the government to say it no longer has any interest in it as such.

It's Maine and Nebraska you're thinking of.

&gt;In those places do they assign delegates by district or proportional to the total popular vote?

They assign two electoral votes based on the statewide result, and then one for each district. In the two states in question, the impact is small. In Maine, you can only possibly steal one electoral vote while losing the state, and in Nebraska, you can only steal two (Obama got just one of Nebraska's votes in 2008). In a larger state though, you could potentially steal away a much larger share of the votes, especially if it's been badly gerrymandered!

I don't know how likely it is to actually happen though. Splitting your state's votes is generally seen as a negative for a state, since it diminishes the potential value of that state in an election.

This is true to some extent.  But, the American people have gotten better at distinguishing policy substance from PR fluff.  Barack Obama defeated Hillary in 2008 by championing a superior policy platform.  While Obama didn't adhere to the economic platform he promised he would, the Democratic base and political independents knew Hillary would never champion the political agenda this country needs.

Since Republican political operatives have recently mistaken Hillary's trust issues with the Democratic base as a political opportunity for them, it's not.  Conservative politicians suffer from a FAR worse trust issue with Americans throughout the political spectrum than Hillary does.  That's why every Democratic Presidential candidate would clean their clocks in the 2016 general election.    

Bernie doesn't suffer from the same trust issues and he is actually championing a political agenda that appeals to Americans on the left, right and middle of the political agnda.  Why is his agenda so effective?  He is going straight at the special interest groups who have corrupted the federal government to the point of utter dysfunction.

Yes, but they are measuring averages so you have to use an average to compare apples to apples. If you change the form of measurement, it comes out differently.

If you compare Arkansas to the ""national average"" for income as Politifact does, you have to do the same thing with the Gini coefficient [which accordingly puts it below the average nationally] if you are making the argument I am. 

You can't counter the argument by changing the form the measure takes to something other than Arkansas v. National Average. If you have to do that, you are admitting Politifact is lying by omission [which they are].

one of the key reasons Obama was able to win in 2008 was because of his revolutionary fundraising style...using small contributions from millions of americans over the internet he outraised hillary and everyone else.

that ability to fundraise from the general public on the internet would be a big democratizing force in american politics today if not for Citizens united which allowed the super wealthy and corporate america to regain control of a system being wrenched from their hands.

Sanders needs to replicate Obama's 2008 fundraising success to even be noticed because he has exactly 0 chance of attracting large backers and because of citizens united the competition is wealtheir than it would be by an order of magnitute.

this also sets up quite a stark contrast between his message and the backround of the american politcal landscape.

&gt;I don't think both parties are the same, and last time I checked the Senate had a Republican majority. Democrats aren't immune to the influence of money in politics (Who is Wallstreet backing?) but they frequently don't target the middle class and poor in the same way or ignore facts because it's convenient for business.

At any rate though, that doesn't change the damaging influence money has in politics even for the Democrats. Obama has ties to Goldman Sachs and other Wallstreet firms. Guess who wasn't punished when they caused the financial system to melt down? 

That wiped out lots of people's savings, caused them to lose their jobs, etc. It was severely damaging to the middle class and poor. Some of the kids from that era just entering the work force will never, ever recover from it because jobs were lost forever or retained by baby boomers who lost their nest eggs. They also have massive debts to pay off. The wealthy of course walked away just fine and dandy, if not richer now than ever.

Meanwhile you have the TPP getting rammed down our throats and the Democrats as a whole are either supporting it, or doing nothing about it. There's Warren and Sanders who are publicly against it, but they are more liberal and progressive than the usual Democrat. The Democratic party now has everyone but the far right authoritarians and pseudo-anarcho-capitalists in it, and that's a lot of different political views.

Yes, the Democrats aren't pissing on NASA or denying simple scientific facts but there are still people in the party who are accomplices to the dirty things big business and the wealthy are doing in this country. We have a serious problem that crosses party lines here, and that is big money influencing politics.

I'd be more interested in seeing those counts if democrats were majorities, and just looking by how hard it was for Obama to pass his main campaign promise of healthcare reform (which failed to have a single payer provision) in a democratically controlled House and Senate, I'd be willing to bet some of those votes may change. Regardless, I find it hypocritical that Democrats will talk about how bad campaign finance is, but they won't hold themselves to a higher standard.

We can't really know what Obama would have done if Republicans didn't block his every move, and that's unfortunate. But the fact is, on the things he could change (drug policy, military intervention, diplomacy (recently regarding TPP)), he hasn't really done all that much for liberal causes. I think you're right, he's a fine president if you have centrist views, but for people such as myself, those things he failed to do matter a lot. I think the most disappointing thing of all is that he didn't veto the renewal of the Patriot Act. He could have forced the House to vote 2/3 (only 250 voted yea, when 290 is required to pass veto), and more likely could have forced debate and restrictions with that veto. But he didn't do that.

Maybe I'm not giving credit to her for what she does support. I guess I just don't see her changing her foreign policy and domestic security policies that Obama has continued from Bush. But I assume she hasn't actually spoken against those things, so I am wrong about that. 

I would be fine though with Obama part 3 if the other choice was only a republican, but I would much rather have someone like Bernie. And frankly Bernie has ethos; I believe he will try to deliver on his promises. I just think establishment Democrat politicians will say they support things just to get elected.

[Here's the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.

The following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:

* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, 

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%

Now, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):

* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% 

* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   

* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, 

* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%

So, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It's hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it's an insanely large difference.

Secondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus ""not-Hillary"" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary's level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains ""flat"" she'll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he'll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). 

Additionally, the ""not Hillary / Bernie"" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she's included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She's [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). 

If I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the '08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially ""Warren Lite"". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.

So where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)

-----------------------

**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama ""only"" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he'll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she's doing a better job positioning herself as the ""populist"" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn't chip away at her initial polling numbers.

[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]

&gt;I am arguing that it is ""conservative"" because it has been supported by supposedly ""conservative"" politicians.

And I am telling you that those politicians you mentioned are not considered to be Conservative based on popular opinion. Go on r/conservative and make a fake post about how Nixon is great. You are going to get a lackluster response. Actually, you're probably going to get alot of people comparing to him to Obama and how Obama makes him look like a choir boy. 

&gt;Authoritarianism is not a ""conservative"" principle. It has however been a tactic used by both ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" politicians, as I have defined above.

Actually, as I have defined, but OK, if it makes you feel better and save face

&gt; No politician has held 100% ""conservative"" principles. If you are going to argue with people every time they use that that label you are going to waste a lot of your time.

I have a better idea - you could not associate Conservatism with Authoritarianism. In fact, what you could do is **don't let politicians represent philosophies.** There, problem solved.

Right now, many of our eastern trading partners aren't bound by any kind of reciprocal trade agreement.  That leaves some rather gaping loopholes in trade law.  TPP is intended to close those loopholes.  If you don't understand why TPP is so popular among both Democrats and Republicans, getting angry at Hillary for supporting trade reform makes little sense.

I'm not sure what ""pro-NSA"" is supposed to mean.  Hillary backed Mark Udall's campaign for NSA reform back in 2014, before Udall was ousted from his Colorado Senate seat and replaced with a pro-NSA Republican.

And Hillary loves to play tough on national defense, because she thinks it plays well with older voters (pro-tip: it actually does).  It's a weakness that sank her '08 campaign.  I'm still waiting to see what her '16 platform is going to be on defense, but if it's anything like her husband's, it'll involve big defense budget cuts and liberal reforms of military policy.

&gt; Then there are issues like campaign finance reform and wall street reform that Clinton claims to be for while taking money from interests that oppose those policies.

Obama claimed to be for them, and backed a number of bills - most prominently, the DISCLOSE Act of 2010.  Obama also took money from wealthy interests.

1.) The president has the power to break up big banks with out having to go through congress. He will need to go through the Supreme Court, but it is worth noting that it is speculated that 3 justices will be nominated by the next president so I think he could have the support.

2.) The president has power over trade deals. Currently Obama is working on a free trade deal within the Pacific rim called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). The scary this about this is that no one is allowed to know what policies the TPP contains until after congress approves it, they aren't even allowed to read it before voting. Sanders is the only announce presidential potential that is against it and as president he wouldn't need congress to act, and it is worth noting that [Sanders largest donations vs Hilary's](http://i.imgur.com/GCOVi0J.png) is really just Union and labor groups vs Wall Street.

This is not a time for believing fairy tales. If the population of voters left of the conservatives screw this up, those conservatives will win the whole ballgame. 

Disbelieving totally? Same result. The GOP just wins because you don't show up *now*, instead of showing up now and then not showing later.

Believe what is likely to be truthful and discard that which is pandering. Support someone, anyone who has ideas that can pass through a GOP congress with a bit of compromise, not radical Earth-shaking ideas that won't make it out of any committee, anywhere. 

Vote with your brain, for what we can actually accomplish, and not with your heart for what you wish would happen.

2. It's my understanding that the definition of ""unemployed"" has gotten narrower over the years, so maybe prior administrations were using u6 and Obama is using u3? Don't know, just a guess. I DO KNOW that the current unemployment percentage DOES NOT take into account people who have stopped looking for work/given up, people who are UNDER employed, and people who have reached the end of their benefits. In short, it only takes into account people who receive unemployment benefits, which is a small number compared to those TRULY ""without"" a job.

Wishy-washy at best :/ 

I have witnessed her fight for rights for women rather vehemently though and she has been a voice for social change concerning minorities. I will give her credit for that. I would love to see her do more. I don't want to demonize her, I just don't entirely trust her, /u/VoltaireReInc.

Comparatively, she is decidedly mainstream liberal on most of the wedge/social issues. Economically though...I'm still not convinced and she needs to speak out about Wall Street and actually practice what she preaches. 

edit: ""The files show several of her staffers lobbied actively on behalf of the gay community during her husband Bills White House tenure, while presidential aides debated how to position him on key issues given his personal opposition to same-sex unions."" Good on her staffers. We may have to wait on the debates to hear more from her. I'd love for her to clarify alot of her key positions. I WANT her to clarify for us where she stands on the important issues. But, again, what we DONT need is lip service just to garner votes for her to turn around and pander to the billionaires like it seems Obama has done on several occasions. We don't need more of that. She needs to come out strong and really convince people she won't do that and I'm still, after all of these years and witnessing what she did as a senator for NY, not convinced.

It would be nice if that's true, but it's not.  Most Republicans have been blocking anything even remotely close to a path to citizenship, calling it ""amnesty"".


&gt;She was against the Obama style plan originally (in 03) but now she wants to go even further. 

That's not actually accurate.  Her position has always been roughly what Obama's position is; basically, give legal status and a path to citizenship to people who are already here, while also enforcing the border to stop more illegal immigrants from coming in.  That's the ""grand bargin"" Obama's been trying to get his entire administration, and that's the same thing she supported.

So, no, her position really hasn't changed.  Yes, she was in favor of a ""border wall"", and she was also in favor of a path to citizenship.  That's not a contradiction, it's basically the same compromise that Democrats in general have been pushing for for the last decade now.

Now, personally, I think the whole ""border wall"" idea is stupid and pointless, a total waste of money and effort.   But that's really a different issue; the positions she's taken here are consistent and pretty common among progressives in politics.

I don't buy that. Even back when Bush was in office it was clear that the Pentagon was telling the White House that attacking Iran was a no-go. Since then the Iranian position has gotten stronger and the US' weaker. At some point the military will force the government to stop engaging in losing wars because it's bankrupting and ruining the country. Of course, we could hope the American people do that, but we're too busy voting for our two war-loving parties for our bloodbaths to end without someone stepping up.

As for Syria, if you ask me it was likely the presence of Russian ships off the Syrian coast that would have directed Syrian anti-ship missiles to US ships, some strong words from Russia to the US (which we are paying back in Ukraine), and a face-saving ""out"" for the US provided by the Putin/Kerry chemical weapons deal that all combined to convince the US not to attack.

But Afghanis have a long, proud history of ejecting foreign invaders from their land, and all the signs point to the US losing yet another war there too.

In a year or three we'll ""declare victory"" and leave just like we have in every other losing war effort our empire engages in. We'll leave a devastated country and then our propaganda systems will start their revisionist history spinning of how our actions were ""honorable"" and that we meant well.

792,"&gt;A lot of dems feel the same way about Clinton right now, but I doubt they wouldn't vote D come election day.

Respectfully, that confidence is misplaced because Democratic voters didn't show up to vote in either of the midterm elections after President Obama demoralized them with Conservative/Third Way Democrat policy positions which he didn't run on in the general elections.  Even more telling, Third Way Democrats lost their re-election bids while Progressive Democrats held their seats.

Hilary Clinton is a Conservative/Third Way Democrat who is unlikely to champion the Progressive policy agenda this country desperately needs.  This is not lost on the Democratic base.  As such, she is unlikely to turn out the Democratic vote either as long as she adheres to those policy positions both before and after the election.

One final point, it appears that the Clinton camp assumes that if they don't make any meaningful Progressive commitments during the campaign that they can evade their fiduciary duties to this nation and the Democratic base.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Assuming Hillary is elected, she has two Presidential paths before her...the one blazed by Herbert Hoover (aka the Third Way Democrat path) or FDR (aka the reform-minded Progressive path).  History already tells us which one is the wiser path to take, but that choice will be up to her.  Ultimately, she'll be the one to suffer or benefit from that choice in this nation's annals of history.  Barack Obama made the wrong choice by siding with Wall Street over Main Street.

Agreed, my biggest disappointment with the Obama admin.

&gt; Guantanamo?

Not entirely in his control. He ordered the CIA to shut it down as one of the first things he did when in office. Unfortunately there's that tricky bit about what to do with the prisoners and congress historically had laws regulating the release of said prisoners. Those regulations have softened recently, but there is still a question about what to do with the prisoners.

&gt; Banks?

Obama had a choice during the height of the recession, throw all effort into pulling the economy out of its free fall or endeavor to bring some individuals to justice. There may not have been enough political will to do both, and the support (or lack of efforts to undermine) of wall street and the like was important to achieving some pretty critical successes in that battle.

He made his choice, and you can criticize it certainly, but I don't see how this choice makes him equivalent to a Republican.

828,"The GOP is simply a far better political party than the Democrats.  To be clear on what I mean, here's a definition:

&gt;A political party is an organization of people which seeks to achieve goals common to its members through the acquisition and exercise of political power.

The GOP is among the best in the world at the game of politics, the Democrats average at best.  They use every tactic available, gain every little advantage.  They are better at fundraising, better at focusing their base, better at pushing as a unified front.  

But what they are really good, better perhaps than any political movement in modern history, is pushing fear.  They've learned that fear is the secret to a unified political base, a way of forcing social conservatives to hold hands with financial conservatives that come from entirely different backgrounds.

Examples?  /r/conservative.  Breaking down their top posts (note, this is general.  I'm mainly noting the fact that they AREN'T talking policy issues, but rather pushing tension):

* Fear of blacks
* Fear of blacks
* Fear of Mexicans
* Fear of blacks and Mexicans
* Fear of big government
* Fear of Mexicans
* Nothing
* Fear of Mexicans
* Fear of liberal media
* &amp;c., with some fear of Muslims thrown in

Almost every post is designed to create tension towards an out-group.  You'll see very similar things at /r/republican, or even non-US conservative subreddits like /r/tory, albeit with different out-groups.  

The constant usage of fear acts as a massive directing force for the Republican party, and the same tactics have been used for massive conservative shifts in almost all the English speaking countries (Canada, the UK, and Australia have all shifted heavily towards the right).  

Fear is so useful to a political party because it lowers critical thinking and dissension. Republicans aren't less intelligent than Democrats, but they have to deal with far more fear-pushing bullshit.  How can a person vote in their own best interest if they have fear clouding their judgement?  

Liberal groups try to use fear in similar ways, but they fail because their out-groups are more abstract.  Because their base is more varied, they don't have convenient scapegoats like conservative groups have.  Compare ""the rich"" versus ""Muslims.""  Which is easier to picture?  Which is easier to to use as a boogeyman?  

The great thing about the Republican tactics is that they feed into themselves.  They push conspiracies to create fear, and that fear lowers critical thinking and makes it easier to push other conspiracies.  This is why they make everything into a conspiracy.  Climate change isn't just wrong, it is a global liberal conspiracy.  Hillary and Obama aren't just bad politicians, they are involved with scores of conspiracies.  

TL;DR:  Most of your rant comes down to the fact that a political party's goal is not to improve the country, but to win elections.  The Republicans are far better at winning elections, motivating their base with fear while the Democrats struggle with voter apathy because they can't use the same tactic nearly as well.

830,"&gt;when republican policies pushed us to the brink of another depression?

They were Democratic policies too. I know that's easy to forget.

&gt;How are we so mad at Obama

Now I need to vent. Obama had a super majority in Congress when he first came into office, and rather than using his majority to pass a higher minimum wage, reform banking in a meaningful way, raise taxes on the 1% or pursue green energy policy he decided to pass his legacy and force the ACA through a Democratic Congress. A law that gives huge handouts to the country's wealthiest corporations. He also raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than any other president and has deported more immigrants.

That's not all. Obama expanded America's foreign policy, drone use and military spending, while doubling down on the domestic spying he promised to eliminate. He also pushes secret trade deals that will continue to benefit the top 1% at the expense of everyone else.

Despite all of this, people continue to support him because he talks a big game. He says the things we all want to hear knowing he can't follow through on it, or purposefully does the opposite. But the Republicans are worse right? They're the ones responsible for running once prosperous cities into the ground from decades worth of poor policies.

You mean you're mad that he passed one of his largest campaign platform promises?  Ok...

&gt;  A law that gives huge handouts to the country's wealthiest corporations

It also helps a bunch of people without insurance, taking a burden off of all of us.  If corporations benefit and citizens do too, no reason to complain.

&gt; He also raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than any other president

First of all, more medical marijuana dispensaries have been created during his presidency.  There are 23 states plus DC that have legalized medical marijuana.  In 2008, there were only 13 states.  You are manipulating raw data to support this absolute bullshit point.

&gt; has deported more immigrants

Now this is clearly a soundbite from some shitty news source.  Do you know that the term ""deportation"" hasn't officially been used since the 90s?  Reports have combined the number of those deported from the country and the number of those prevented from entering the US to form the new official term: Removal.  I can't actually address the deportation statistics because they haven't existed for nearly 20 years.  ICE has recently started to put out its deportation and exclusion figures because the media has been misrepresenting their reports for a long period of time.

On a statistical basis, I can tell you that you are once again repeating some stupid ass soundbite that misrepresents the data.  Yes, by a pure numbers perspective, we can assume that the agencies who can remove illegal immigrants have done so to more people under Obama than his predecessors.  With that being said, the number of expulsions since 2009 has fallen by 40%.

&gt; Obama expanded America's foreign policy, drone use and military spending

No shit he expanded our foreign policy.  Our foreign policy under Bush was to be friends with those who can give us stuff and bomb the fuck out of those we disagree with.  Expanding our foreign policy is very, very, very important in such a globalized economy/society.  Maybe we should treat other countries with respect.  With more connections, treaties, and partnerships in place, we can grow to be greater.

&gt; drone use

Instead of throwing troops at our problem.  I see Bush as a small scale version of Stalin.  Got a problem?  Just throw people at the problem until it goes away.  Obama brought lots of troops back and started using drones instead.  That, to me, is fantastic.

&gt; military spending

One of the largest costs we have that is under military spending is paying down all of the debt that the two fucking bullshit wars in the Middle East caused.  

On another note, the Congressional Budget Office said that military spending from 2000 to 2009 increased at an average rate of 9% per year.  Since 2011, we have generally seen a steady decline in defense spending.  So I don't know what the hell you are talking about when you say Obama expanded military spending.

&gt; while doubling down on the domestic spying he promised to eliminate

Doubling down?  Really?  Ever heard of the Five Eyes?  It was a group of five countries (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and UK) who decided to divide the world up into groups and have each Eye spy on a different group.

* US spied on Middle East, China, Russia, Caribbean, and Africa
* Canada spied on Russia, China, and Latin America
* Australia spied on South and East Asia
* New Zealand spied on Southeast Asia and Western Pacific
* UK spied on Europe, European Russia, Middle East, and Hong Kong

They divided up the fucking world in 1946 to create spying assignments.  You think Obama has doubled down when the NSA looks at everything that enters or leaves the US?  You think Obama has doubled down by spying on allies and other countries?  He hasn't doubled down on anything.  The NSA was formed in 1952.  You think they haven't been changing what they look at over the decades?  You think the CIA and other intelligence agencies haven't been adapting to the tech age we live in until Obama stepped in?  That's absolutely laughable.  Forget about Snowden for a second.  There have been many people who work at the NSA who leak shit, and they date back to the early 2000s.  This has all been going on for decades!

&gt; He also pushes secret trade deals that will continue to benefit the top 1% at the expense of everyone else

If they are secret then how do you know who it will hurt and who it will benefit?  Maybe he just doesn't want Congress jumping down his back like what happened with Iran.  They almost ruined negotiations because they couldn't keep their mouths shut.  This deal will open the doors with a bunch of countries that our businesses have not really reached out to yet.  The countries involved are: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.  Saying that the trade deals will benefit the top 1% is like saying a corporation becoming a Fortune 500 company benefits those who hold the largest portions of stock.  Well no shit, Sherlock.

Companies will be expanding into new markets and that will certainly allow the 1% to bring home larger paychecks, but it also will lower costs to the rest of us.  If a company is producing a metric fuckton more of a product, it will be cheaper as they are moving more of the product for a cheaper price.  That's how Capitalism works (in an oversimplified way).

&gt; people continue to support him because he talks a big game

Actually, he doesn't.  The one thing I hate about Obama is that he isn't and will never be the kind of 'in your face' guy we see in leaders around the world.  With that being said, it's his level headedness that I love about him.  He never acts with aggression.  He always faces a problem and tries to find a solution before acting.

&gt; He says the things we all want to hear knowing he can't follow through on it, or purposefully does the opposite

Welcome to politics.  Plan for the worst, and hope for the best.  Quit complaining.

&gt; No, wait, that was what the Democrats did to Detroit

Now that is a whole different can of worms.  Policy did not make Detroit fail.  There was an awful chain of events dating back to the 1950s that caused Detroit to fail.  If you want to open the can, I'm prepared.

Ah, the good ol' days in Detroit.  The car industry was booming and all of the car manufacturers needed more employees!  This was the 1950s, so WWII was over and there were a bunch of skilled metal workers.  The automotive industry of course boomed in Detroit, so that's where everyone went!  The city grew up to 1.8 million people in the 50s, making it the 5th largest city at the time (also would be 5th largest today).  

At the time, there was a man by the name of William Levitt.  He is considered the father of suburbia, known for mass producing housing developments at upwards of a new house every sixteen minutes.  Large suburbs started popping up everywhere around the country, including around Detroit.  Little by little, those living in Detroit started moving out to the suburbs.  Between 1950 and 1960, approximately 179,000 people moved out of Detroit into the suburbs.  In the 1960s, this trend continued at a rate of 10,000 people per year moving to the suburbs.

So now the year is 1967.  Lyndon B Johnson was our president, and we were fighting in Vietnam.  In Detroit, what happened in 1967 was a catalyst to white flight.  At this point in time, 12th Street was the place to be if you wanted nightlife.  On July 23, 1967 at 3:30am, police raided an illegal club that was operating out of a civil rights group's office.  That night, the club was holding a party for several veterans, including two hot off the plane back from Vietnam.  Police moved in and everyone at the party (85 in total) refused to leave.  

Now, rumors had been spread around the area that the cops had shot and killed multiple black people in the few days leading up to this night, so tensions were high.  As the last person was taken away to be arrested, people started throwing bottles at the police, and a riot erupted.  This riot is still one of the worst in US history, with 43 people dying, 1,189 reported injuries, and over 7,000 arrests.  Governor George Romney sent in National Guardsmen and President Johnson sent in members of the military to put an end to the riot.

After the riot, and as race tensions grew to very high levels, whites fled to the surrounding suburbs to find peace.  The population of Detroit in 1970 was now 1.5 million and declining.  At around the same time, auto manufacturers started building new plants elsewhere, and also started to import more vehicles.  The Detroit area now held a very small piece of the automotive industry.  Property values dropped, tax revenue dropped, violent crimes increased (especially murder), and those who could afford to move to the suburbs did so.  Detroit didn't have enough money to combat the crime in the 1970s, and they had no way to make any money.  No one wanted to move into Detroit.  It was just hell.

These trends continued even further, and Detroit's population was under 1 million in the 2000 census.  In 2013, they hit 688,000 people.

Some things are out of the control of policies.  This spiral caused a major budget deficit, and ultimately lead to bankruptcy.  Right now, Mike Duggan, a Democrat, is turning the city around.  You will see great things in Detroit in the coming years.

&gt; Democrats, despite their policies of good intentions, slowly killed one of America's greatest cities.

&gt;The DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act reduced the amount authorized to $475 billion. 

Okay, you were off by $325 billion, but hey, the banks still got a lot of money...

&gt;By October 11, 2012, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stated that total disbursements would be $431 billion and estimated the total cost, including grants for mortgage programs that have not yet been made, would be $24 billion.

...or not. But hey, even $24 billion is too much to ask for, right? 

&gt;On December 19, 2014 the U.S. Treasury sold its remaining holdings of Ally Financial, essentially ending the program. TARP revenue has totaled $441.7 billion on $426.4 billion invested.

Hmmm, *so giving away $700 Billion dollars* ended up being a $426.4 billion loan which was paid back on time, in full with interest.

&gt;Are you suggesting that once a court rules a law unconstitutional, the president is required to waste tax dollars challenging that decision all the way to the SCOTUS?

If it's a federal law, then unless either Congress repeals it or SCOTUS declares it unconstitutional, he *can't*.

If a district court, for example, calls a federal law constitutional, that doesn't really matter worth a damn, as they don't have the legal authority to repeal a federal law based on unconstitutionality. *Only* the Supreme Court can do that. It *does* allow the argument to continue to move up the chain and into the supremee court. Until the Supreme Court makes a decision, the president does *not* have the legal power to ignore the law.

This is why presidents can't just arbitrarily end laws they don't agree with. That's why they need either Congress or SCOTUS to either repeal it or declare it unconstitutional (respectively). Presidents have every right to think something is unconstitutional, but they do *not* have the legal authority to deem something constitutional or unconstitutional. It's also why federal laws don't get repealed just because a district court declares it unconstitutional - because district courts do *not* have that power.

At the end of the day, either we all pay more in taxes to cover those without insurance, or we pay a little more insurance and less in taxes.  Obamacare is trying to shift these burdensome costs into the private sector, which is actually ideal.

&gt; I'm not manipulating anything. The number of raids went up when they should have been going down. It's not ""okay"" because the number of dispensaries went up too. You're saying he's allowed to raid them because there were more of them. I don't understand that.

Lets take two scenarios:

* Scenario A: There are 100 marijuana dispensaries, and 20 of them are raided by police
* Scenario B: There are 1,000 marijuana dispensaries, and 21 of them are raided by police

Scenario A is worst because that means 20% of the dispensaries were raided.  In the case of Scenario B, there were still 979 (97.9%) dispensaries that were not raided.  Police raiding 20% of the stores is much worse than police raiding 2.1% of the stores, yet you are saying Scenario B is worse because they raided one more store.  There are many more places to go in Scenario B, and although I think the raids should stop altogether, I would prefer the police raid at the lower rate of stores.

&gt; Instead we have more instability in the Middle East

The Middle East hasn't been stable since before imperialism in the area.  I don't know how long you have been watching the Middle East, but Syria has been getting progressively worse for the past 10 years, Iran has been getting worse since the new regime was put in after our failed attempt with the Shah, Iraq has been in shambles for a long time, Afghanistan has been run with terrorists since we gave them guns to fight the Soviets, etc.  The majority of the instability in the Middle East was either caused by imperialism or containment.  Nothing is more unstable now than it was before Obama, just now we have more technology to show us the battlefields easily.

&gt; and the US is involved in more conflicts than when Bush was in office

The only way this statement is true is if you include conflicts in which we are helping to arbitrate.  We have fewer troops on battlefields than under Bush, and that is what I find most important.  Too many soldiers and civilians have felt the wrath of what war is truly like through injury or death to themselves or each other, and it's awful.

&gt; Troops don't bomb weddings and create massive collateral damage.

Drones don't get blown into pieces by IEDs.  Drones don't have to watch one of their brothers die from gun fire, and worry about taking the body back for a proper burial.  Drones don't have to worry about insurgents that strap bombs to their vehicles and drive towards the drone's company.  Drones don't get mental illnesses.  

Drones don't have families who sit at home hoping they don't get a knock on the door to give them bad news.

&gt; That was a really long, irrelevant post about nothing. Doubling down is a semantic term that you seemed to take too literally. The point was Obama has pushed for NSA spying and eroding the 4th amendment.

I don't agree with what the NSA is doing, but it's absolutely Constitutional.  The recent court ruling from that federal court was one of the shittiest rulings I've ever read.  They were clearly digging to find something to be the grounds for their decision.  The NSA tracks anything going in or out of the US, meaning it crosses national boundaries.  By international law, they are allowed to do that.  There is no 4th amendment for when data passes over national boundaries.

Even if the information stays in the US, it uses government owned infrastructure which is where the track everything.  They are not acting with disregard for the Constitution.  That being said, I hope Congress can legislate away the powers they gave them.

As for the Five Eyes, that was the way the US spied on everyone, internationally and domestically.  My point was that they've been doing all of this for a while now.

&gt; Why are they secret? Obama has said that if people knew what was in the deal the public wouldn't support it. It looks like you are immediately supporting Obama despite not knowing anything about his TPP.

Don't ever try and tell me what it looks like I'm doing, because you will be wrong 999,999 out of a million.  First of all, I think Obama is right in his comment that the public wouldn't support it.  Then again, our country is dumb enough to try and become fucking Christian, yet complain about the countries run be religion in the Middle East.  We can't even let gay people marry in every state yet.  We, collectively speaking, are fucking stupid.  I wouldn't trust this stupid ass nation to remember the names of all 50 states or even our national anthem.  

Also, there is a very good reason to trust the TPP.  Canada and Japan are two very close allies.  They have no reason to fuck us over, and we have no reason to fuck them over.  We all protect each other in negotiations, and I expect no difference now.  At the end of the day, I don't think the US, Canada, or even Mexico goes in without each other.

If the negotiations had only the US negotiating in favor of North America, I would be worried.  The fact that there are other countries we are very good friends with who have spoken positively about the TPP provides me the evidence I desire to feel good about the deal.  I absolutely trust South Korea, Canada, the US, and Mexico to all look out for one another.  

My guess to why they are secret is that the countries are talking about lifting major trade sanctions and tariffs, which would cause hell, as seen after the Iran negotiations.

&gt; So a crackdown on a club caused the downturn of Detroit?

Absolutely, 100%.  If you have any examples, though, I'd love to hear them.

I'm not an apologist.  That requires something to be controversial.  Maybe if you just stopped believing everything you have heard elsewhere and actually dug deeper into the points you try and bring up, you would understand how unfounded your claims truly are.

880,"I've not been around as long as McGovern and Mondale but I have been around for more than a few primary fights. The key aspect that people for sanders seem to keep forgetting is that party leadership makes a huge difference. There seems to be a misconception about Obama's run in 2008, he basically had a perfect storm of good speaking, surprise challenging, debate skills, and most importantly endorsements and even with all of this it was an incredibly close race. Obama began effectively courting super delegates in 2004 when he gave the keynote at the convention, from there he used Dick Durbin to establish connections within the party. Super delegates matter. A lot. They count towards overall delegate count and their endorsements can make or break a candidate. They campaign for you and usually have a following that brings votes, Obama actually beat Clinton in super delegates and that was a Huge determine factor of him winning. Sanders doesn't have any of that built in, he's from a small state with little connections, and has been running as an independent his whole life, sometimes even against democratic candidates. A lot of party faithful will be wary of that. 

I use Obama as the example because really there's hardly anyone to compare Hillary to, she's been so well established its crazy and just added Secretary of State to her resume and I think she's learned from her failed run in 2008. Plus She has the power of using one of the most popular figures in the party, if not the most popular figure in the party with bill Clinton. It puts her in a unique position. She's extremely well established, currently well liked in the party with a variety of experience and a huge secret weapon campaigning. Obama negating bill a little by getting maybe the most well liked woman in America on Oprah to campaign for him in 2008 in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Bernie doesn't really have that help, even the biggest name that would most likely agree with him, Elizabeth Warren, seems to be tepidly supporting Clinton probably looking to run in 4-8 years herself. Now Maybe you could argue Robert Kennedy in 1968 challenging the sitting Vice President but he had the Kennedy name and even before the assassination he was trailing and likely to never catch him in delegates. 

Overall I think it's great a lot of people are excited about sanders but party politics is tough, and the general can be even harder. I don't see Obama's unlikely win in sanders. He has a lot of things working against him and a lot of problems in terms of electability to compound those problems. There have been similar candidates (kuchinic, I know people hate the comparison but Ron Paul for the republicans, etc) and they have faced the same hurdles in the past without much result, I'm not optimistic about his chances but everyone has the right to campaign and donate and speak in favor of a candidate I just hope people take a step back and be realistic about the situation. If they end up disengaged because Clinton wins or wins big I am afraid of the progressive base of the party not showing up to vote as is needed in the general. There seems to be a resentment about her, which granted I know for progressives she's hardly a perfect candidate but she's also a lot better than a republican. Having a republican president could be disastrous for the Supreme Court. There are currently about 4 justices at or approaching retirement age. Ginsberg, Kennedy, Breyer and Scalia. Two of those are liberals, one is a swing vote and one is a conservative. If any one of the first three leave with a republican president then the court shifts from a split court like we currently have to a solidly conservative court, and the other justices are young in comparison. It's really something that could affect the laws of this country for decades. It's what concerns me the most.

And in a practical sense, how will the legislative branch review this during the 60-day review period? Will each member of Congress source a team to comb through the document? Is there evidence they're currently soliciting volunteers for a crowdsourcing effort? That's 500 pages a day if it is indeed 30,000 pages, and still a ton if it's only 10,000 pages.

The length of the document alone should give people pause that it's easy for items to get missed during the review period.

&gt;All submissions to /r/politics need to be explicitly about current US politics. This means that if a subject has political implications but does not directly discuss politics it is most likely off topic.

&gt;To be explicitly political, submissions should focus on one of the following things that have political significance:

&gt;* Information and opinions concerning the running of US governments, courts, public services and policy-making.

&gt;* Private political actions and stories such as demonstrations, lobbying, candidacies and funding and political movements, groups and donors.

&gt; **This does not include:**

&gt;* The non-political actions of otherwise political figures. (ex. Barack Obama Painted a Picture of Himself)

&gt;*    Relatives and associates that do not have political significance. (ex. Diane Feinsteins Father, Predator, Attempts Murder of Arnold Schwarzenegger)

&gt;*    International politics unless that discussion focuses on the implications for the U.S. (ex. Tension Between Greece and Italy Over Rising Cost of Feta Cheese)

&gt;* Discussion about the media or media outlets. This includes articles that analyze their actions. (ex. Fox News Reporter calls President Barack Obama Stupid and Ignorant)

No. they always vote democratic.

&gt; Sadly, Obama turned out to be a far more divisive President than he could have been, and I think his lack of experience (only a few years in the Senate, no real job outside of academia before that) was part of the reason.

No. The GOP made him look divisive, when most of the time he just did what an average democratic president might do.

I know that happened, but it doesn't bother me, because I'm confident that Obama has been a better president than either of those candidates would have been. I also think more people *didn't* vote for him because he's black than *did*. Also I, and many other Americans (I think), are tired of war. I was already in 2008.

I've made the same post on the subject a [couple](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqvvpsg) of [times](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqvvpsg) and thought I'd reiterate it here. 


----------------------------------

Using the Obama primary campaign as a comparison, what is the likelihood of Sanders' campaign against Clinton succeeding? [Here's the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.

The following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:

* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, 

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%

Now, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):

* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% 

* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   

* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, 

* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%

So, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It's hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it's an insanely large difference.

Secondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus ""not-Hillary"" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary's level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains ""flat"" she'll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he'll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). 

Additionally, the ""not Hillary / Bernie"" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she's included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She's [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). 

If I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the '08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially ""Warren Lite"". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.

So where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)

-----------------------

**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama ""only"" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he'll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she's doing a better job positioning herself as the ""populist"" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn't chip away at her initial polling numbers.

[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]


-------------------

Now, as has [been correctly pointed out in each of the two times I've posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqw26xs), Obama entered the primary in February, so by now he'd already been campaigning for some time. However, when you go back to the February data, the picture just gets more damning. 

Lets look at the data back in mid-Feb. There were two polls 2 days after Obama announced:

** Poll 1**

* Clinton 37% - Obama 17%, 

** Poll 2**

* Clinton 28%, Obama 24%

So this actually paints an even bleaker picture for Sanders. Coming into the race, Obama and Clinton were polling neck and neck in one poll and were relatively close in the other. Sanders is down by like 50 points in all of the polls from early May when he announced.

#In Conclusion:

The polling data would suggest that Sanders is going to have a much harder time (than Obama) dismantling the ""presumptive nominee"" Hillary Clinton.

One saw this on election night with Karl Rove where he *could not admit* that he was wrong about what was going to happen.

Looking at it Obama was much better positioned than sanders so much so it's far off to even compare the paths they had/have, the only thing revolutionary with sanders its virally backed very early where Obama tapped into social media a little later but to a much bigger degree. Obama used a grassroots campaign but he compounded it with an effective strategy to win the primary with endorsements and big name support. Sanders has almost no super delegate support at the moment, Obama had been working on his essentially since 2004 when he did the keynote and connected with long time party insiders dick Durbin, deveal Patrick among others to essential wreck Clinton's party by overwhelmingly taking super delegates, most notably Ted Kennedy who might have been so important it won him the whole damn thing. On top of that Obama started with Oprah campaigning, which was huge and had an extensive network of community organizers and training in community organizing to win Iowa and gain momentum from there, then bill clinton's gaffe in South Carolina which helped turn out even more African American voters made him dominate South Carolina. 

Obama started out stronger, caught Clinton by surprise and have a clear plan set in place to win the nomination with years of back work and it BARELY worked out for him. That's not to even mention he was a once in a political generation speaker and excellent debater with a clear concise message. Sanders has a nice message but isn't a great orator, doesn't have any democratic connections (he's not even been in the party, he's ran against democrats his support by the brass of the party is very small) and many other factors on top of how hard it was to beat Clinton the first time, most likely harder this time now she's taking the primary serious from the beginning and essentially paid her dues to the party elite means sanders has a very small chance of pulling anything off. He's improved but not polling as well as Obama when he started off and his fundraising numbers look nice now but over the scope of what the primary and general will cost isn't all that important yet, especially with the fundraising power that Clinton has.

955,"&gt; Why did you ignore the only poll done after he announced his candidacy that shows Bernie at 20%?

I'm not ignoring any polls. As I stated at the top, this is a rehash of a comment I have previously made (two days after he announced). The Economist poll (what I assume you're looking at) hadn't been done at the time and I hadn't (until just now) gone back and looked to see if any new polling data had been collected. 

So lets look at this poll:

* The Economist (with Biden) Clinton - 58%, Sanders - 17%, Biden - 13%
* The Economist (without Biden) - Clinton 68%, Sanders - 20%

So, what do we see here compared to the other polls? I see two important notes. 

1. First, all the Biden supporters flock to Clinton when given a choice between Clinton and Sanders. Biden voters are generally going to be the more moderate voters, so this makes sense. There's more it implies about the difficulties with Sanders appealing to moderate voters in general (which would certainly hurt his chances in winning the primary and general elections) but there's some amount of my own bias wrapped up in that assertion, so we won't get too much into that. 

2. Clinton has 70% of the vote right now. That's literally (not figuratively, but literally) twice what she was polling at this stage of the game in 2008. If you think this spells a better picture for Sanders you're dreaming. He's down by FIFTY (50) points; Obama was never down by more than twenty (20) at any point during the '08 primary. Most importantly, Clinton already has well past the 50% margin that she'll need to win the thing...

&gt; And why are you comparing against polls from 2008 taken months after Obama announced his candidacy vs polls taken either before or just after Bernie announced his? Take the polls from early February 2007 and Obama is at &lt;20% in a lot of them.

If you read my whole post you'll see that I in fact addressed this issue and compared the ""Sanders two days after announcing"" polls with the ""Obama two days after announcing"" polls. The data is just as bad for him.

Clinton faced just as much party divide and opposition (if not more, I mean he was impeached simply for having an affair, which every president starting at GW has done yet Obama hasn't been impeached), yet Clinton was able to get the republicans to compromise with him.

The simple difference is the current Republican party has a greater hatred for Obama, but why? If anything his policies stand closer to the republicans of today then Clinton's did of his day. Obama has tried so hard to compromise, he starts his positions with a plan that is already better for the republicans then the democrats which is not something Clinton did, he fought the republicans tooth and nail on policy.

970,"No offense, but I think you are looking too far ahead.. The odds of Sanders winning the nomination are very slim.  The only way I could see it happening is if halfway through the primaries Hillary had some health emergency and was forced to drop out.  Even then, I wouldn't bet on it because the Democratic party establishment would enter panic mode and pull whatever shenanigans necessary to pick someone else as nominee.

As much as Reddit loves this guy, and don't get me wrong I like him too, he is not electable in our current political climate.  A not insignificant portion of the population honestly believes everything Obama does is some sort of secret communist plot to subvert the constitution and declare martial law. They believe this about Obama, whose actions as president could barely even be characterized as moderate.  How would they react to someone who openly declares himself a democratic socialist?  No amount of reasoning and explaining will convince them that he is not Lenin reborn.  

What Sanders run can do though is provide a platform for expressing actual progressive ideas and actually fight for them rather than apologize for them.  This is a fight that needs to happen for there to be any chance of moving the political discourse back towards the realm of sanity where in the future a person like Sanders will have an actual chance.

Honestly, I'm not sure I would even want Sanders to win the nomination this year.  People are quick to forget history.  McGovern in 1972 comes to mind.  He was the Liberal wet dream.  He had helped reform the democratic nomination system so that the nominee was chosen by the primary voters instead of democratic party bosses.  Then he ran a powerful grass roots campaign to win the nomination in the face of huge establishment opposition within his own party.  After winning the nomination he received little support from much of that establishment and outright opposition from some of it.  He then went on to lose 49 of 50 states in the general election and lost the popular vote by 23 points making Richard Nixon president again.

I'm not saying people shouldn't vote for Sanders.  I hope they will and in large numbers.  But if we want real change in the Democratic party and country as a whole I believe we would be better served by him coming in a strong second for the nomination than winning it.

Having your own perceived wing usually comes after having held several terms and gaining influence throughout those terms. This clout makes her an anomaly of sorts. But the reason she's this powerful so early is because she can cut through bullshit like nobody's business. And, what's more, she'll likely back Bernie Sanders.

Bernie is also good at cutting through bullshit. He doesn't have the sudden fame that Warren does, but if you listen to him talkwhether it is in the 80s or todayhis message is consistent and clear; he's fighting for the middle class. His voting record shows this, as does his fundraising.

As far as Obama is concerned, he's been a good President save for one issue: he compromised too much.

Obama campaigned on bipartisanship, and, in his first term, he made concession after concession to Republicans. I believe during the fiscal cliff negotiations, he offered 14 compromises to the Republicans that were all rejected. And, the eventual compromise was worse for the Republicans than all of the offers that the White House put on the table.

In Obama's first term, he had majorities in the House and the Senate. He could have met with leaders in the party to push through agendas more effectively, but he tried (and tried) to get Republicans to work with him. And, what seems to be his good nature, and willingness to work with others, has bit him in the ass and some opportunities were lost.

Now, in Obama's second term, we see a much fiester President. One thing that's true is that there's no reelection to worry about, and less fucks need to be given, but I think the chief complaints about senator Obama during his campaign were true: he wasn't experienced. He wasn't ready for the shitshow he was going to be dealing with.

The same inexperience that plagued young Obama is untrue for Bernie Sanders. Senator Sanders (formerly a mayor) has both executive and legislative experience. And, considering his colorful political background, he's used to deflecting the bullshit that comes his way. In addition, he's not backed by big money, so he won't be compromising because he made promises along his campaign trail.

Ah! substantive criticism of his point. This is much more useful.

&gt; He's doing two things that are meaningless or close to it and presenting them as if they're valid: first, he's taking one week of polls since Bernie's announcement and extrapolating out to the primaries. If it were a statistical model, it'd have an error margin larger than the entire range--so no predictive value. Second, he's pulling a pattern from years ago and trying to lay it over today like a stencil while ignoring changes to the context. 

So, I think these would be valid criticisms if he was making these points in a vacuum. But he's not. He's specifically making the points in the context where people are saying ""look what happened with Obama"" - and in that context, saying that the situation with Obama didn't look very similar and that Obama was in a much stronger position then than Bernie is now is a valid rejoinder, even if you think that there's a lot of room for movement between now and the primaries. 

&gt; I'm making no predictions about Sanders getting the nomination seeing as my entire point is that any predictions at this time are completely baseless.

Any prediction is completely baseless? Suppose Bill Gates showed up tomorrow and offered to make you a deal where you got 10 million dollars if Bernie wins and you had to pay Gates $5 if Bernie loses, you'd take that deal, right? Conversely, if someone offered to make you a bet where you pay $200 if Bernie loses and you get $10 if he wins, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't make that bet. So, even as you think the data isn't useful for making predictions, you are implicitly using it to make predictions, just with what amounts to a very long probability range.

Let's make this more concrete: suppose I offered to make you a bet where you get $20 if Bernie wins the nomination and you pay me $10 if he doesn't. Would you take that bet?

*If* Barack Obama had been born to the same people, at the same time, in Kenya rather than in Hawaii, he would not have been eligible for U.S. citizenship at birth, making him unambiguously not ""natural born"", and thus ineligible to be president.

Here is the current text of ""8 USC CHAPTER 12, SUBCHAPTER III: NATIONALITY AND NATURALIZATION""

http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title8/chapter12/subchapter3&amp;edition=prelim

Anyone reading this should be able to quickly ascertain that if he were born in Kenya, he would not have qualified under any of the subsections (a) through (f), or (h).
The only remaining means would have been through subsection (g), which states the U.S. residency requirements for a single citizen parent giving birth abroad. The current requirement is ""a period totaling not less than five years, at least two of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years"". 

Barack Obama was born on 1961/10/4, and his mother was born on 1942/11/29, making her not yet nineteen years old at the time.

The 1986 Amendment to the law substituted ""five years, at least two"" for ""ten years, at least five"". So at the time of his birth, his mother would have had to reside in the U.S. for ""no less than ten years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years"". Nobody under the age of nineteen could fulfill this requirement. If Obama's mother had given birth to him while in Kenya, neither this, nor any of the other requirements of this law could have been fulfilled, and thus Barack Obama would not have been a U.S. citizen at birth.",2,-0.0164965986395,0.123646489116,0.302267573696,0.191011513265,0.477777777778,0.607142857143,301,0.0892857142857,27.3636363636,0.0416666666667,0.208333333333

(For birth on or after November 14, 1986, a period of five years physical presence, two after the age of fourteen, is required. **For birth between December 24, 1952 and November 13, 1986, a period of ten years, five after the age of fourteen, is required for physical presence in the United States or one of its outlying possessions to transmit U.S. citizenship to the child.)** The U.S. citizen parent must be the genetic or the gestational parent and the legal parent of the child under local law at the time and place of the childs birth to transmit U.S. citizenship.

I agree, despotic political regimes are often embodied in one man, requiring a cult of personality, and when he dies the regime dies with him.

In America today you have something even worse, the one unequal regime continues regardless from President to President, because it is embodied in a constructed idea of American Patriotism and Identity which discourages criticism of any powerful military or financial force.

The regime is coercively operated by these powerful forces by only allowing loyal Presidents who will carry out their dictates. There is a reason it takes so much money to because politically powerful, if they take money from similar companies then what difference will there be in policies.

As for the American government's terrible reputation towards ""political prisoners"", there have been too many admittances and there is too much international reporting to warrant any additional explanation here. See Google and Wikipedia. 

It is worth mentioning that recently, legislation has been passed extending the President's rights. Previously, GWB was able to torture ""prisoners"" without public judiciary oversight (a court hearing). Obama has extended this power, allowing him to KILL ""prisoners"" without a warrant or judiciary oversight of any sort. WTF.

This post is simply a criticism of the American Government, the current regime of that country and how its deplorable actions are comparable to the actions of another regime.

Regardless the propaganda which espouses the moral high ground at home. Neither regime had the moral high ground, and this will become even more evident when these actions are analysed from a detached, historical perspective in the future.

I hold no grunge or criticism of the American public, who I am sure are great people and don't deserve this government to be their representative to the rest of the world.

Clinton supported it because it was obviously the best policy and was recommended by every liberal think tank that had ever studied health care reform.  Obama opposed it because it was politically unpopular, and it was easy for Obama to use it against Clinton by scaring people about ""being forced to buy healthcare you don't need""--[the exact same attack line Republicans used successfully against the Clinton health care plan in 1993](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/obama-does-harry-and-louise-again/).

However, I think *he* also thinks he knows better than the American people (which to be fair, he probably does know better than the majority of them) about why this deal will be good for them. 

The problem is, he's basically cut the American People out of the negotiation process and is trying to ram this deal down their throats. The actions he's taken - from all the secrecy to the straight up or down vote - has limited the input of Americans and their elected leaders in Congress to have input into this deal. 

For example, let's say Congress reads this deal, and decides that the TPP is actually pretty good, but a few things need to be taken out and another few amendments need to be added. Well too bad - Congress either has to take it or leave it due to the way Obama is introducing the legislation to Congress. 

By the way, this doesn't even mention the fact that the American people aren't legally allowed to even read the trade deal right now. Now, if we were discussing matters of National Security like defense agreements between America and Britain, I think the secrecy would be warranted. I could think of plenty of good reasons why you wouldn't want to make some of that knowledge public. However, we're discussing a trade deal - matters of taxation, tariffs, environmental and corporate regulation - things that the public has a right to know. There aren't any good reasons why what's being negotiated and hammered out in the TPP should be kept secret from the people that it's going to be directly affecting. 

But I digress. I don't want to be too cynical but I think this means that Obama is acting in corporations best interest, in the hope/belief that it'll indirectly benefit the American people, than the American people's best interest.

Since we're a consensual democracy, we actually have a leeway in these trade negotiations because with a bipartisan Congress, we can set up better environmental and social standards while the Politburo will agree mostly with whatever Xi Jinping says.

As for the fast-track/TTP, it's not really news because the Tea Party Caucus is successfully filibustering it. If either actually make it into the Senate, it'll blow up at least on alternative/Tea Party new sites. And remember, the people most concerned about this believe that anyone who votes in favor of it is apart of the NWO/UN Article 21 conspiracy to disarm and enslave Americans, which in laymens terms means that a good part of the TP is taking it very seriously. Likewise, the TPP is effectively a NAFTA with China and the EU (assuming I read it right), which the TP in general is completely against as well.

All in all, the GOP Establishment is in a huge pickle because they support it, but half their party doesn't *and* is willing to make a huge mess over it. IMHO, if the GOP can't get it passed by 2018 or so they'll just give up on it altogether.

1109,"[Sigh.](http://www.salon.com/2010/12/15/manning_3/)

&gt;Since his arrest in May, Manning has been a model detainee, without any episodes of violence or disciplinary problems.  He nonetheless was declared from the start to be a Maximum Custody Detainee, the highest and most repressive level of military detention, which then became the basis for the series of inhumane measures imposed on him.

&gt;From the beginning of his detention, Manning has been held in intensive solitary confinement.  **For 23 out of 24 hours every day  for seven straight months and counting  he sits completely alone in his cell.  Even inside his cell, his activities are heavily restricted; hes barred even from exercising and is under constant surveillance to enforce those restrictions.**  For reasons that appear completely punitive, hes being denied many of the most basic attributes of civilized imprisonment, including even a pillow or sheets for his bed (he is not and never has been on suicide watch).  **For the one hour per day when he is freed from this isolation, he is barred from accessing any news or current events programs.**  Lt. Villiard protested that the conditions are not like jail movies where someone gets thrown into the hole, but confirmed that he is in solitary confinement, entirely alone in his cell except for the one hour per day he is taken out.

&gt;In sum, Manning has been subjected for many months without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at Americas Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado:  all without so much as having been convicted of anything.  And as is true of many prisoners subjected to warped treatment of this sort, the brigs medical personnel now administer regular doses of anti-depressants to Manning to prevent his brain from snapping from the effects of this isolation.

&gt;Just by itself, the type of prolonged solitary confinement to which Manning has been subjected for many months is widely viewed around the world as highly injurious, inhumane, punitive, and arguably even a form of torture.  In his widely praised March, 2009 New Yorker article  entitled Is Long-Term Solitary Confinement Torture?  the surgeon and journalist Atul Gawande assembled expert opinion and personal anecdotes to demonstrate that, as he put it, all human beings experience isolation as torture.  By itself, prolonged solitary confinement routinely destroys a persons mind and drives them into insanity.  A March, 2010 article in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law explains that solitary confinement is recognized as difficult to withstand; indeed, psychological stressors such as isolation can be as clinically distressing as physical torture.

&gt;For that reason, many Western nations  and even some non-Western nations notorious for human rights abuses  refuse to employ prolonged solitary confinement except in the most extreme cases of prisoner violence.  Its an awful thing, solitary, John McCain wrote of his experience in isolated confinement in Vietnam. It crushes your spirit.  As Gawande documented: A U.S. military study of almost a hundred and fifty naval aviators returned from imprisonment in Vietnam . . . reported that they found social isolation to be as torturous and agonizing as any physical abuse they suffered.  Gawande explained that Americas application of this form of torture to its own citizens is what spawned the torture regime which President Obama vowed to end:

So what, just sit around and let other countries dictate the trade rules? Pretend that we can really stop globalization? Argue for a better deal, ok what do you think you can get out of them that Obama hasn't tried? In all honesty, this is starting to look like the Obamacare scare nonsense but for the left. You can't be against a deal, because there isn't a deal yet to be made. The reason for fast track authority is that you can't have 535 different people offering up amendments to an agreement that involves 11 different sovereign nations. For every amendment they would have to go back to the countries and say hey do you agree with this? On the secrecy, every single international agreement is done in secret from the Iran nuclear talks to trade agreements. You really can't have serious negotiations without them because people have to be frank, and they're not going to do that if they feel like they have to posture to the general public. Wait until the actual deal comes out, read it and if you think its generally bad then lobby your congressman to oppose it, and if you think its good, lobby to approve it. One thing Obama is right about though and that is the status quo is whats killing our labor market, and we can't compete for low wage manufacturing, unless you want making 56 cents an hour to be the new norm.

That a small shift in the popular vote by just a few points -- a mere 4 or 5 percent -- can take what was a 126-point electoral college lead 2012 and turn it into a single digit nailbiter that comes down to a handful of votes in state like Colorado or Ohio a la Florida in 2000. And speaking of 2000, that is the election that this could most turn out like should apathy set in on the part of the Democrats (and perhaps to a bit of apathy on the part of the Republicans).

I mean, just think of those parallels for a second: In 2000 we had a remarkable popular Democratic president who was reviled to the point of loathing by the opposition party. A prominent member of his administration who is competent but not all that inspiring to the base runs a competent but not inspiring campaign, meanwhile the Republicans, who are tired of losing the White House, settle on someone who is not only politically similar, but is related by blood to the last Republican who won. And even though the previous election had the Democrat winning in a near landslide, this time the election, possible due to increased voter apathy, comes down to a handful of votes in an important swing state. This does not go well for Democrats and a another Bush is in the White House.

WASHINGTON--Tax receipts surged in April to generate the largest monthly U.S. budget surplus in seven years, a sign that deficits could decline more than analysts had expected just a few months ago amid a continuing economic expansion.

The U.S. Treasury collected $472 billion in revenues last month, a record, which led to a $157 billion surplus for the month. While the U.S. tends to run a surplus in April due to tax filing season, the surplus was $50 billion more than last year and the fifth largest monthly surplus on record.

The figures are the latest indication that rising stock values, corporate profits, and incomes for the wealthiest Americans are curbing the growth of U.S. budget deficits that soared in the years following the financial crisis.

Revenues for the fiscal year through April are running 9% ahead of the year earlier, while government spending is running 6% ahead of last year. The fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2014.

For the 12-month period ended in April, the U.S. ran a deficit of $460 billion, the second-lowest annual figure since September 2008. The deficit over the last 12 months is down from the year-earlier figure of $499 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated just two months ago that the deficit would stand at $486 billion in the current fiscal year.

Congress and the White House agreed to a series of spending curbs four years ago that sharply reined in government spending, known as the sequestration. While government spending has advanced over the past year, April showed that revenues are now running ahead of spending, holding down deficits.

Republican control of Congress means that big battles still loom over how much money the government should collect and how it should be spent. President Barack Obama has called for an increase in spending above levels set out by the sequester.

House and Senate Republicans passed a joint budget resolution earlier this month that would boost military spending while holding domestic spending essentially flat. That measure doesn't go to the White House and instead will be used to set overall spending levels for appropriations bills that will go to the president later this year.

Mr. Obama has said he won't accept bills that keep spending at the levels mandated by the sequester nor those that boost military spending without parallel increases in nondefense spending.

Meanwhile, Congress has yet to raise the federal debt limit. The Treasury has been using emergency measures since mid-March to avoid breaching the ceiling. While the Treasury hasn't yet said how long it might be able to do that, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that those emergency measures should last until October or November.

It's amazing how lowering the tax rates on the wealthiest citizens often correllates to some sort of economic decline, overall. During Eisenhower America, that time the Republicans seem obsessed with bringing us back to, the wealthiest citizens paid around 90% in taxes. Nixon dropped this to 70% before Regan lowered it even further (to roughly 30%). Clinton came in and raised it up to approximately 36% and our economy rebounded. Then Bush came in and gave his famous Bush-era tax breaks and I don't have to tell you how the economy looked when he left office.

Obama came along and brought taxes back up to where they were during the Clinton administration and we've seen steady job growth over the last year (at least).

* Marijuana was made illegal in 1937 because companies like Hearst Paper, DuPont, and other industries didn't want to compete with it as an industrial textile product.  Virtually nobody seems to know this for some reason.
* Our public schools are designed to under educate our kids so they will be unable to affect change in society.  Moving your kids into private schools only makes this worse and helps them win even faster.

Seriously though, of course most people didn't pay the high marginal taxes.  Why?  Because you got a tax cut from reinvesting in your company, growing it.  People didn't complain, because this not only benefited the country (growing companies provide expanded employment and a larger tax base) but it also benefits the owner/stockholders (growing companies provide corporate raises and more stockholder dividends).  But nowadays in the world of ""rockstar"" CEOs and ~day~hourtraders, short term profit is king.  Nobody cares about long term growth, so we must cut cut cut taxes and plow those tax savings back into the bottom line to make the executives look good.

Someone seriously said the words ""So long as there is taxation there is socialism. Source: reality""  This is where we are right now.

1211,"I think, in today's society, we've got the worst of both systems. So I blame both Republicans and Democrats. Both ideal systems would work better than today's system if implemented in full. Let me explain:

Socialism won't work perfectly- because you can't account for laziness. If people are allowed to become complacent, and let the rest of society upkeep the system, more people will become complacent. It's only in extreme utopian socialism  though, and for the most part, a ""regulated market"" does a fairly good job of eliminating disadvantages to harbor good business practices.

On the other hand, capitalism won't work perfectly- because you can't account for greedines. There will always be CEOs who have too much control and can afford to abuse employees. By the time you have the infrastructure that Walmart has, you are almost literally too big to fail, and can abuse employees with very little consequence.

But the key to capitalism... is that it needs to be void of regulation instead. The democratic party *loves* regulation. Meaning having laws around employment: Minimum wage, insurance, retirement, benefits, hourly limitations, overtime exemptions, etc. along with some industry-specific regulatory things: environmental, food, health, trade, etc.

But what we have today is essentially (and what Obama seems to like) is more of the free market model, but with a ton of regulation. Which means the infrastructure-rich corporations have limited small-market competition, because any mom-and-pop shop doesn't have the resources to compete in an industry. So it allows large companies to develop monopolies.

TL;DR (phew): Socialism would work better if we had a ton of regulations and the gov had a hand in every employer:employee relationship. Capitalism would work better if we had limited regulation and allowed innovative new companies to enter an industry.

-There was no real ""Conservative Plan"" when Obamacare was up for debate, the Conservatives in power bitched about the law but didn't suggest realistic changes that would have made it any better. Personally I think Medicare for all with the option to pay for ""Premium"" plans through third party companies would work better but that's just me. Also there needs to be transparency in pricing (imho the real problem with the US Healthcare System).

-There have been multiple times in the last few years that we've cut Food Stamp Spending, it's not so much that people want to take away food benefits as it is that they actively have taken away food benefits. This is an area I've only ever seen a GOP member propose, though several Dem's have voted for them and Obama hasn't vetoed them. Again, I'd love to be proven wrong on this, I've looked and haven't found any examples to support the idea that the Dem's are equally involved in cutting food benefits. 

-Again, I like you're idea. Marriage should be the realm of the religious and the government should only recognize Civil Unions and those should be available for all. I've talked at length with a great many Conservatives about this idea and most support it. I've never seen a member of Congress or anyone with the ability to institute this idea, speak of it. I could be wrong but it seems neither side wants to get the government out of the business of Marriage.

The meaning of the word ""socialist"" is still dynamic.  It is interpreted as anywhere from full-blown communist to a reluctant admission that a social program is the only thing that currently works to solve a problem, but otherwise, everything should be capitalist.

Look at Eisenhower in the 1950s, for example: ""Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism.[117] He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years, [which had not been completed under Truman.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower)

Today we only talk about smaller government, privatizing Social Security (Even Obama pushed 'chained CPI', which would have reduced Social Security payments over the years), and cutting benefits.

A ""socialist"" during the Eisenhower administration would have been a communist.

Today a ""socialist"" is someone who is a capitalist.  However, they are willing to accept that if there is a great need which cannot be met by capitalist means, then they are willing to accept a socialist solution to the problem.

1281,"How many different things are wrong with Jeb's argument?

For one, the student is slightly exaggerating. Bush obviously didn't literally create ISIS, but Bush's war did create the sectarianism, reduce the barrier to the entry for Al Qaeda in Iraq which did not exist prior to the war, and decimated Iraq's economy and stability. 
In 2006 hundreds were dying as they are now in the sectarian conflict while US troops were there defending the sectarian regime. 

If the US can be linked to ISIS, it is because of the exact opposite of the reasoning Jeb gives -- not because we ""left,"" which we arguably didn't, but because we were there and stayed.

For one, Obama did not really pull us out of Iraq. He did everything in his power to keep thousands of US troops there, and when the Iraqi government refused to play along after the WikiLeaks scandal, he continued backing the sectarian regime with billions of dollars in weaponry and support. Even after the US pulled the boots off the ground, weapons, personnel, advisors, contractors, and others continued going to maintain the monstrosity that the US -- mostly under Bush -- set up.

But that's not where it ends. In 2011, as the Arab Spring began, thousands of Iraqis took to the streets demanding an end to corruption and sectarianism. Guess what happened? The US, backing Maliki, gunned them down. 

Now combine that with the fact that many of the people who had been tortured in US/Iraqi prisons had a much less flowery idea of resistance and the fact that neighboring Syria collapsed, and you get ISIS.

Perhaps if the US had not invaded the country, built up a fake sectarian regime so that they could keep it from kicking them out, loaded it with corruption so that contractors could make a killing, and then continued funding them no matter what they did, THEN there would be no ISIS. As the war itself showed, the presence of lack of US troops on its own was not a meaningful factor in whether or not sectarian violence engulfed that country.

Other than that, there is no issue. ISIS is a threat to Iraq and Syria, not to the United States. ",4,0.021450617284,0.2003229906,0.408179012346,0.303447496413,1.0,1.0,373,0.0341463414634,21.9411764706,-0.1,0.2
1282,"This is sort of wrong. I mean yes Obama was wanting to get out of Iraq but the situation was more complicated.

The agreement basically stated that we had to be out of the cities in Iraq in 2009 and leave in 2011. It mainly came down to the fact that the Iraqi Courts wanted to start trying Coalition forces for any alleged offenses. They had this power years before but didn't use it and threatened to do so because of public outcry. Honestly the war for Iraq messed up a lot of things. I hated Saddam but he kind of kept Iran in check and radical Islams in the region in check. Another issue is the fact that most Iraqi security forces were basically lying to us and acting like they were far more prepared. When our advisors got back over there recently they had found that many positions in the military had just be boughten by people with no training.

You asserted that Bush was responsible for extremists taking over the Arab Spring rebellions.  There was no Arab Spring while Bush was in office.

The destabilization created by Bush's policies may have led to the Arab Spring - but then it seems like the Arab Spring would have kicked off somewhere other than Tunisia if that had been the case.  The reality is, population dynamics and poor governments and increasing Islamization in the Arab world have been building up a powder keg for some time.  

Additionally, like you said, Obama had been in office for 2 years when the Arab Spring kicked off.  He actually was in position to back moderate and non-Islamist factions in the Arab spring.  Instead, particularly in the case of Egypt, he chose to explicitly support the Muslim Brotherhood (who are the ideological progenitors of just about every Sunni extremist movement today in the Muslim world, including places like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Indonesia).",0,-0.0197916666667,0.18526779738,0.332291666667,0.245209559713,0.6,0.6,184,0.095652173913,23.0,0.1,0.275

1360,"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/declining-labor-participation-rates/

&gt;Among the reasons cited for the trend:

&gt; * 1) **The aging of baby boomers.** A lower percentage of older Americans choose to work than those who are middle-aged. And so as baby boomers approach retirement age, it lowers the labor force participation rate.

&gt; * 2) **A decline in working women.** The labor force participation rate for men has been declining since the 1950s. But for a couple decades, a rapid rise in working women more than offset that dip. Womens labor force participation exploded from nearly 34 percent in 1950 to its peak of 60 percent in 1999. But since then, womens participation rate has been displaying a pattern of slow decline.

&gt; * 3) **More young people are going to college.** As BLS noted, Because students are less likely to participate in the labor force, increases in school attendance at the secondary and college levels and, especially, increases in school attendance during the summer, significantly reduce the labor force participation rate of youths.

&gt;**So no matter who was president, and independent of the health of the economy, BLS projected in 2006 that labor force participation rates were going to go down.**

While older workers stating in the labor force is a trend it does not even begin to offset the far greater numbers of baby boomers fully retiring. Participation of the young has been falling because they have stayed in school longer.  And your response also ignores the falling participation rate of women since 1999.

EDIT: And obviously the financial crash of under Bush and the Great Recession inherited by this President has made the labor participation rate worse than predicted.  But when you have a Congress that has refused to work with the President to do anything to improve the situation, other than the initial stimulus package passed by the Democrats, your angry is focused in the wrong direction.  

And despite all the headwinds to job creation created by Congress **this President is on track to eclipse Reagan, Bush 41, and Bush 43 in total job creation.  In fact the only other modern President who is likely to eclipse Obama is Clinton, another Democrat.**

First I'll say how this particular style of debate forms opinions on a topic.  In this style, you have 20 minutes to hand-write notes for the debate.  Nothing else can be used.  This means, in order to prepare the best arguments in that short time, the team must predict likely topics and pre-research topics and arguments.  The side of the debate is not known until the topic is announced.  This means, she not only had to research every side of this, but she most likely had to defend each side as well.  If she's on a top debate team, and she's debating multiple sides of an issue against other top debate teams, you can trust that her opinion on that issue after that debate has been weighed against some of the best analysis, research, and arguments that exist on the topic.  **I say this to show that this isn't something hand-fed to her from a poli-sci professor in her sophomore year, but a well researched and warranted analysis.**

Another popular argument in this style of debate is the critique.  It bypasses the argument itself to attack the language used in that argument and it forces the debaters to analyze and discuss the impact of rhetoric on a topic.  Based on that, I believe her singular ""Bush did it"" wording to be a rhetorical attack on Jeb's ""Obama did it"" wording.  Especially considering the analysis she provides after the headline quote.  Like others have said, it's silly to believe ISIS was created by any single person, let alone any single president, and I think she applied her understanding of rhetoric to criticize that approach, since Jeb had been using it that very meeting.

Just wanted to give some context.  It doesn't seem like many here disagree with her anyway but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Yes, and when you look at Obama's position on Iraq, Syria, and Libya, you see a pattern of aggressively warlike behavior.  Obama went so far as to break a campaign promise to try to keep troops in Iraq, killed Gaddafi, and wanted to do something similar in Syria.  This is all hawkish behavior.

And while I appreciate your interest, I can't say I agree with your statement. I don't know that I would call what Bush did stupid as I am not sure of the actual reasons behind so many of the decisions they made. 

But invading Iraq, a sovereign county that had never attacked or even directly threatened us, on the basis of information that was questionable at best seemed to be a decision that lacked both wisdom and vision. And that is not Monday morning quarterbacking. The problems with the intelligence were well known at the time. 

However creating a government that disenfranchised so much of the population of Iraq did seem to be a very stupid move. Allowing systematic torture to be conducted in military prisons was wrong on so many levels that I don't see how it could expected to result in anything other than massive blowback. 

And I know you want to attribute shared blame to Obama. But I don't think that is fair. Obama was given an incredibly bad hand to deal with when he came into office. He could either prolong the military engagement and leave soldiers open to criminal prosecution for their actions, leave them there in violation of international law, or adhere to the withdrawal schedule that was created by his predecessor.

1453,"&gt;Of her top 10 lifetime contributors, five are major banks: Citigroup (her top donor), Goldman Sachs (second highest donor), JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.

You realize those are all individual contributions? From Individuals who WORK at those companies?  Go to any donation page and it requires you to enter your employer and type of job.

Let's do some math.  Bernie is sitting at ~$42/person, and no one has said shit about that. Obama got around ~$66/person.  So, lets assume somewhere in the middle of $54/person.  Let's take Citi group. $260,000 from individuals in 2008.  Using our average of $54/person that is 4817.77 people who donated from Citi at that amount.  Now, remember, Citi has 243,000 people according to wikipedia. 

So that works out to 1.98% of Citigroup's employees donated an average of $54 to Hillary.  Citigroup, a company BASED IN NEW YORK, where Hillary WAS A SENATOR, and had her presidential bid.

Now, Remember, 
&gt;""Approximately 4 percent of Americans made contributions in any amount in 2008.""

So ""half"" of the 4% may be a little high. But, also consider that:

&gt;""The top 5 metro areas for contributions to federal candidates in 2008  **New York**, Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston""

And I think overall it's just a case of ""large companies"" have a lot of people. And if on average 4% of people donate, the larger companies will have ""higher donations"".

Also, you just hand wave the law firms ""Arps et al, two law firms;"".  When Skadden Arps *HAS* (estimate wikipedia) 4500 employees.  Which means, if they gave 'the average of $54' half of their company would have had to give money.  Which is not reasonable. She probably had a bunch of lawyers give the max amount (So did Obama/McCain).

And also looking at opensecret you'd see Her #1 contributor is Lawyers with $23Mil, then retired with $14.7mil, THEN securities &amp; investments with $11.2mil (Wall street is in NY).

Many of the people who work at those big firms *are* lawyers.  And honestly, are you really surprised people at large companies donate money to their senators?",5,0.0707919092402,0.151672070969,0.432398865502,0.264430117986,0.704761904762,0.8,356,0.0544554455446,13.6923076923,0.0,0.0

Both did great things domestically along with some really shitty things. Agreed. Politicians are more than a series of positions on policies.

I think I would have left JFK out of the mix, though. Aside from the space program what did he do that was good? He was inaugurated in '61 and shot at a little over 2.5 years into his term. Charismatic man, to be sure, but I don't see that he accomplished much.

I don't know if the US would be a better place today had LBJ not occupied the White House. I can say that the US is a better place because FDR did.

Of course Obama was a better choice than Romney or McCain. But that is damned faint praise. I think Kucinich was a better choice than Obama, but that's a moot point other than to point out the advantages of vigorous debate in a primary system.

I will even go you one better and point out that it was political suicide to vote against the was in Iraq or the Patriot Act when those votes came up. Few voted against either and many who did would up out of a job eventually.

You are incorrect when you say that the President does not influence the direction of the country. I agree that much of what Bernie espouses would never pass a GOP held House, never mind a fractious Senate. However, after the last 35 fucking years I want an assurance that the person holding the veto pen has the best interest of the working class/lower economic classes at heart. Bernie does, and I can say that unreservedly.

I cannot say the same about Hillary, given what her donor list looks like, given her support of free trade agreements over the years, and given that she was a part of the team (92 election, the DLC, the massive corporate spending on her husband's campaigns and the subsequent wholesale shipment of jobs overseas) that started whoring out the Democrats to Wall St.

As far as I can tell, she is just another politician with her damp finger held up to tell which way the political wind is blowing.

I know Bernie is not of that sort.

Then again there is her personal wealth. How does a politician who hasn't worked in the free market since the 1980s amass 15.8 million? Am I to believe that she feels no obligation to those that made her so wealthy?

This is not really about a candidate, btw. It is about a movement. It is about driving this country left. It is about hammering conservatism down like a nail sticking out of a floorboard.

1492,"So you would have pulled up all arms and left the Iraqi's with no means of defense after deposing their government and throwing their country into turmoil? Doesn't sound either a moral nor a very smart plan.

And Obama did not force Snowden to flee to the People's Republic of China nor to Russia. Snowden chose to do so of his own free will to avoid facing charges for his admitted acts of theft of government property and espionage. 

And anyone who cared to pay attention knew about the NSA programs long before the Snowden leaks. They were well reported in the press. In fact one of Obama's better known campaign promises was to stop the illegal warrantless wiretapping taking place under the Bush administration. But this is off topic since you were supporting your statement that Obama is a ""distinguished liar.""

As for Obamacare, Obama should have added to his promise that you can keep your insurance plan unless your insurance plan is a piece of crap that doesn't properly cover you or unless your private insurance company decides to change or drop it. Ditto for some people who's insurance premiums went up. In almost all cases, that was not Obamacare that forced the change. That was the private insurers raising their rates. It's anecdotal, but my costs have actually gone down since my private insurance was forced to issue me a check because they had not met the required ration of health spending to premiums.


And thing with Zac Galafinakas, I hadn't even heard about that. I had to look it up and found it was a case where he was doing a comedy interview. Apparently he said ""most"" so people say he lied. If he had said ""many"" it would have been completely true. That was much more likely a simple misstatement than an attempt to lie as there was really nothing to be gained and no harm done. To be honest, when you raise stuff like that it looks like you're searching for stuff to support your beliefs rather than looking for issues of substance.

And the claim they have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas is true. Please note the word ""will."" That statement was in reference to his administration's raising future federal fuel efficiency standards to achieve 54.5 mpg by the model year 2025. That's pretty big change which is double current standards. And considering the strong opposition and little progress over the decades, that's a huge accomplishment. Again, it looks like you're trying to parse words to find lies. Also, I'm pretty sure the actual change already since Obama took office is much closer to 20% than the 11% you claimed. 

While I do agree the secrecy surrounding TPP negotiation is reason for concern, that is not a lie in any shape or form.

The closest thing to a lie you listed was the Mitt Romney wouldn't let a gay couple adopt a child. That certainly is misleading, but it's not technically wrong. Because Romney has clearly stated he would not allow civil unions if they were the same as marriage except in name. He would push those decisions back the states where it is clear some states would not allow adoption by gays. But even still, that was not something Obama said. It was something that came from a campaign commercial. 

Again, it sounds like perhaps you're spending too much time listening to misinformed bloggers, bogus Politifact evaluations, talk radio, or Fox News who constantly perpetuate these overblown negative criticisms.

So unless you have other stuff, I think you calling him a truly distinguished liar is way over the top when compared with things like ""I did not mean that to be a factual statement"" or when I say I mean something literally it is ""not to be taken literally"" or ""we spend more money on antacids than we do on politics"" or ""the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised"" etc.

If they are kicking us out of the country, then yes I would take the guns. Nothing immoral about leaving a place that's threatening you after you tried to help it. Leaving with the guns would have preferable to giving ISIS their startup loan.

Yes, the Zac Galafanakis interview was comedy. Doesn't change the fact that what he said was very incorrect, and he never bothered to correct it later. Obama's corrections and apologies seem scarcer than gold. And not because they shouldn't exist. Just because he spends so much time blaming the wrong people.

You and I appear to have found different statistics on the MPH standards. The numbers I found point to 11 percent. More importantly, his words were, ""we HAVE doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas."" That's a lie, that hasn't happened. If you want to talk about parsing words. Pretending that his statement didn't resoundingly say it's already been accomplished? That's parsing words, very incorrectly as well.

He does not get to decide whose policies are crap. His statement was that if you like yours, you get to keep it. It's just that simple. That was a lie, and you know it. You can't justify it. What he said was untrue. That's called a lie. The premiums will go up for many people. Specifically younger people, and people who are healthy. The basis behind that fact is the age band, disallowing the elderly from being charged more than 3 times what young adults are. And that unhealthy people can't be charged more based on being unhealthy. To compensate, insurance premiums will raise young and/or healthy people. Average insurance premiums will go up 27 percent according to the CBO. I can link the article if you'd like. Another lie in his belt.

Snowden brought the matter to national light. Most people learned about the NSA's unconstitutional behaviour through him. You cannot deny that. It was Obama's choice not to pardon such admirable behaviour. So yes, he had to flee. It was his choice, his only choice. Agreed there may technically be no lying to be done there. But the omission of those activities from the general eye is the same in my opinion. The clues may have been there. That doesn't make it okay. Anytime Obama said he would protect our rights and defend American principles. If he said that while knowing about the unconstitutional activity going on under his nose. Then he was lying in my opinion.

No the TPP was not technically a lie. Maybe I should have said he was a distinguished sneak. Trying to get something fast-tracked like he did takes away from the system. It's not the way things are meant to be done. It's un-American, and it's sneaky. Though not technically a lie.

The current head of the groups military council, for example, is believed to be Abu Ahmad al Alwani, an ex-member of Saddam Husseins army. So too was al Alwanis predecessor. Another member of the military council, Abu Muhanad al Sweidawi, was once a lieutenant colonel in Husseins air defense intelligence, but by early 2014 was heading ISIS operations in western Syria, according to the report.

&gt;Similarly, two deputies to the Islamic States self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, are former Baathists: Abu Muslim al Afari al Turkmani is believed to have been a senior special forces officer and a member of military intelligence in Husseins army. Today, as Baghdadis number two, he supervises ISIS operations in Iraq. The second deputy, Abu Ali al Anbari oversees operations in Syria. Both men are also thought to serve on the Islamic States main governing body, known as the Shura Council.

As much as Hillary criticizes CEOs for their compensation  package the average CEO of the top 350 US companies makes about half what Hillary and Bill made in the past 15 months.  Your ""tens of millions in stock options "" a year is by and large a huge exaggeration. Only TWO CEOs in 2013 made over 26 million and yet Hillary and Bill can make 30+ million in a similar time frame working for those very companies, and foreign ones, and that's all perfectly acceptable.  I don't understand the do as I say not as I do logic that Democrats defend so vehemently when it comes to The Clinton's.     Your blanket criticism of corporate CEOs is as stereotypical as someone saying all the protesters in Baltimore were rioting imbeciles  or every cop is a racist psychopath. 


It is also so ironic you talk about jobs being sent out of the USA . Bill Clinton signed the most devastating piece of legislation for the american worker of all time when he ratified NAFTA.   The AFL-CIO blames  NAFTA for costing the US 700,000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico alone!!    We also run trade deficits of 100 billion plus every year with our NAFTA trading partners.   Bill Clinton did more damage to the American labor Unions then any 50 CEOs combined!! 

Let's not forget a CEOS primary job is to protect the companies share holders and long term future.  If they can outsource jobs to India where the average salary is 3600 a year it's only logical they would do so. The GOVERNMENT of the USA who in theory is suppose to be looking out for the citizens of our county should be enacting laws to prevent this.  Yet Clinton signed in the worse trade deal ever for American workers and president Obama is trying to one up him with an even worse deal for the working class. The unions are so panicked and realize  hope is lost in the manufacturing sector . This is  why they have started this campaign for the fast food workers to make 15 an hour. They don't care about the fast food workers, they need to replenish their ranks.  You don't find the timing a little strange? Why all of a sudden after over 50 years of fast food workers making virtually nothing do the unions care about the workers at McDonalds?  


The facts are that all the things you hate about the CEOs are things you should hate about your government . The CEOs don't write trade law, environmental law, health care law, or any other law of the land.  The CEOs just very wisely buy influence from politicians on both sides of the aisle so these self serving politicians will do their bidding.  It's a tough argument to debate when families like the Clinton's who in Hillary's own words were "" dead broke when they left the White House  ""   15 years later have a personal net worth of 100 million and control a charity whose revenue is over 200 million more every year.

1561,"Let me give you the Cliff's note version: No he doesn't.

A little longer version: In 2007 at about this time Clinton had about a half dozen real or potential challengers and was polling in the mid 30's. Obama polled in the 20's and everyone else polled in the teens at best. Clinton's unfavorables were also much, much higher than they are now. People _wanted_ someone besides Hillary in 2007. And the polls (and eventually the primaries) reflected that.

In 2015 Hillary has 60% of the primary vote and ~80% favorability ratings among Dems. They are far and wide, perhaps not excited with her so much as satisfied with her as a candidate and as president.

If Bernie was going to move the needle against Hillary in the last 3 weeks he would have done it by now. But guess what? He hasn't moved the needle at all. There are plenty of Democrats chomping at the bit for Hillary to have a legitimate contender and you'd think they'd be lined up to vote for anyone but her. And they just don't.

Three weeks later and she's still at 60%; he's still at 15%. And my trump card for ""Bernie has no support"" is when people are given Elizabeth Warren as an option (I  know she's not running) his support plummets to the mid single digits at 5-6% and she pulls 15% and Hillary still gets the same 60%.

What do you think is going to happen when some other people with liberal bona fides like Martin O'Malley or Lincoln Chafee get in the race? Or someone to run at her from the right like Jim Webb? Is that when everyone starts lining up behind Bernie? Or is that when we get to see that the ""Anyone but Hillary"" crowd maxes out at about 20-25% of the base (which is what we're seeing right now in the polling) with a handful of people willing to try out another candidate for a week or so before going back to Hillary.

Maybe the law of gravity catches up with Hillary's numbers and she gets brought back down to Earth and starts polling in the mid 40's. That's still 50 points split 4 ways with 70-75% of Democrats still viewing Hillary as a first or second choice. There, simply put, is not enough oxygen for someone to survive let alone thrive against Hillary this year.

And before you play the 18 month card, the Democrats' election starts a little less than 9 months from now. By the evening of March 1 of next year there will have been 13 primary contests held and while the GOP circus will be going for a good long time, that's going to be the end of the Dems' competition because that's when everyone's sugar daddies will decide if they're getting another allowance. And considering that Bernie Sanders, unlike Barack Obama before him, detests corporate fatcats financing his election bid, he'll be out of cash by then --  if he makes it that far in the first place.

Here is what the [sierra club had to say about the TPP in regard to the environment](http://www.sierraclub.org/trade/trans-pacific-partnership)

&gt;Threat to Forests, Wildlife, and Fish. On January 15, 2014, WikiLeaks published a draft environment chapter of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). TPP governments have billed the agreement as an ""ambitious, 21st-century trade agreement."" However, a joint analysis by Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) reveals that the current TPP environment chapter text does not meet that goal. In its current state, in fact, the TPP could lead to increased stress on natural resources and species including trees, fish, and wildlife. To read our analysis

Here is what [non-profit public citizen had to say about the TPP](http://www.citizen.org/TPP)

&gt;The TPP is a massive, controversial ""free trade"" agreement currently being pushed by big corporations and negotiated behind closed doors by officials from the United States and 11 other countries  Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.

[Here is a study done in australia (by academics, mind you) which looks at the health care affects of TPP](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1402/S00215/protecting-the-health-of-australians-in-the-tppa.htm)

&gt;The brief highlights the ways in which some of the expected economic gains from the TPPA may be undermined by poor health outcomes, and the economic costs associated with these poor health outcomes

Lots of 'liberal' voters are just apathetic and don't vote... for candidates who refuse to represent their interests. Despite the political strategy of lesser of two evils, many people simply don't vote at all when it comes to a choice of ass-tearing sodomy or shit-in-the-mouth. You might think the choice is clear and eagerly line up to cast your vote for such, but a ton of apathy and 'laziness' does indeed come from having 2 terrible choices.

Sanders is more than just an old white man, he also represents a very rare chance for moderate to left liberals to actually have somebody worth voting for. Hillary was and is courting the left as a 'I'm not going to represent you, but who else are you going to vote for?' voting block. She's clearly taking the liberal vote for granted, which is one the greatest flaws in the democratic party. Having locked down the lesser of two evils votes from the left, she could safely swing right... but Sanders changes all that.

The failure of trust between police and local communities arises due to two major factors:

1. The incessant ""it's not your fault"" message received by poor people that encourages them to externalize their problems.  That's not to say that poor people don't face institutional disadvantages.  But it isn't remotely in their self-interest to blame such disadvantages.  If poor people want to get ahead in life, the solution isn't to blame all the nebulous obstacles - but to figure out ways they can get around them.  Blame does not solve problems - which is why we go through this same cycle again and again.

2. Police just uphold the laws they're required to uphold.  Most law enforcement officers are fairly decent sorts.  They - mentally - have a distinction in their mind between ""laws we have to uphold"" and ""laws we're forced to uphold"".  If you're selling loosies on the street, your average police officer will walk by without saying anything.  He understands that, while illegal, it isn't the kind of illegal he's *forced* to address.  But once a merchant starts complaining, the police officer is forced into a confrontation.  Police officers are not seeking out confrontation - they're engaging in the confrontations we forced them into by passing laws.

The sequester, where the US Military was forced by finances to reduce its forces, and Obamas closure of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars brought troops home and reduced the need for equipment. Rather than trash or recycle or sell older or excess equipment, the Pentagon sought to place it where it could be used within the US.

&gt;Where the US has been [bracing for rioting](http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue417.htm) among its citizens, and arming its federal agents accordingly, they never intended to have local law enforcement rise to the level of the US Military. The sequester, where the US Military was forced by finances to reduce its forces, and Obamas closure of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars brought troops home and reduced the need for equipment. Rather than trash or recycle or sell older or excess equipment, the Pentagon sought to place it where it could be used within the US. Images of military grade gear in Ferguson raised the issue, but more than Ferguson is behind Obamas concerns.

&gt;The press during the Bush administration to have an excuse to [invoke martial law](http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue012.htm) was unrelenting, and included the release of a [live bird flu virus](http://www.zetatalk.com/index/zeta215.htm) to 4,000 labs around the world by the CDC, a matter the FBI declared was [not an accident](http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/19ja2013.htm). The elite within the US are determined to have the US military forced to protect themselves and their assets as soon as possible, and the [rioting encouraged in Ferguson](http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/29no2014.htm) was a nudge in this direction.  Obama has been getting demands on a steady basis from the elite and is now pushing back. One does not militarize the hall monitors in schools, nor the guard at the mall, nor the local police. When it is time for the US military to become involved, to assist and defend the American people, it will not be the elite who will decide.

Also, Hillary is bungling her campaign by not engaging the press, not answering any questions, she has yet to solidify any position on any important issue, she's not even attempting to be concerned about any perception of wrongdoing by herself or Bill (in fact, she seems offended that anyone should dare question her), and she's trying to position herself as a populist, while the reality is she's not just the 1%, she's in the .001% of income, after having spent the last decade or so making ungodly amounts of money for simply giving speeches.

1659,"&gt;**Despite Hillarys ambitions, she is unlikely to get the Democratic Partys nomination in 2016 for a number of reasons. Hillary is far too cozy with Wall Street, and has what many in the public would consider a skewed opinion on poverty. She herself thinks like a wealthy person, the 1%, and cannot hide these attitudes.** Where Obama gave her an opportunity to flesh out her resume as Secretary of State, Benghazi occurred on her watch and any Republican opponents will not let this rest. And despite public appearances as a married couple and with a new grandchild, the specter of Bills constant and continuing sexual exploits is one such factor.

&gt;This reflects on Hillary, as it begs the question of why Bill is constantly seeking sex outside of his marriage. Whats wrong with Hillary? And why didnt she divorce him years ago? The conclusion is that her ambitions, that it is her turn to be President, are driving her decisions. Bill is a consummate politician, helping any candidate on the campaign trail, as is well known. Hillary hopes that if they hide his escapades, the past will fade away and she can finally be anointed President. Now it is clear that the opposite will happen.

They argue that he had already made up his mind to withdraw almost 100% of the troops (to satisfy his campaign promise) and didn't really make an honest effort to find a solution to the status of forces issue.

IIRC the original agreement that Bush negotiated didn't require the approval of the Iraqi National Assembly (just the President), but Obama insisted that the new one be approved by the Assembly (which was highly disfunctional). A charitable interpretation is that he wanted it to have more legitimacy (by being presented to and blessed by the country's elected body rather than just the President).

It was ultimately Bush's decision to go into Iraq, however, he hasn't been president for almost 8 years now, so it really is quite irrelevant. In the same way Bush still gets blamed for the economy today. It hasn't been his economy for almost 8 years.
But I suppose we want facts and truths. Then we need to actually look at those truths and not just what the government's media wants us to hear. I have many friends and relatives who were among the first infantryman to set foot in Iraq. It was a hard battle. And through tears and terror, and laughter and smiles, they would tell me the stories of what they saw over there. Sadam did have caches of chemical weapons throughout the country. Hundreds of them that were destroyed when our troops went over there. Chemical weapons he was still using on his own people. Obama bombed Lybia for doing just that same thing. No one seemed to have a problem with it. Did Sadam have nuclear weapons? No. No he did not. That was false information. Likely a lie. But the majority of the people of Iraq were beyond grateful to have US troops helping to free them from the oppression of Sadam. My cousin told me a story of a village they had searched. The people were so Tha kill for what the troops had done that they made a huge meal for the soldiers and had asked them to join the village elders for that meal. Three of my friends told me similar stories. How they were greeted by hoards of welcoming people every time they entered a village or town. Isn't that what the United States of America does? Free people from oppression? Except in our own country. But you wouldn't hear those stories in Ted Turner's Democratically controlled media because that wouldn't help the Democrats. 
Then there's the rhetoric that Sadam supported terrorism. Did he directly fund or was responsible for the 9/11 attacks? Maybe. Maybe not. There's no proof either way.  What we do know, however, is that he did in fact fund terrorist groups. And offered sanctuary to terrorist groups in Iraq. Throughout the many raids performed in Iraq by special forces groups, my cousin among the soldiers in these raids, they found a huge number of safe - houses that held different tools that were or would be used by terrorists (shoe bombs, book and briefcase bombs, plans, etc.). The reason these groups didn't take over Iraq as they are trying to do now, is because they had free reign. They didnt have to take over. They had a safe place to go to.
Osama claimed in a video to attack the US because of our support of Iran during the Iran/Iraq war. That's fact. Gives credence to the idea that Sadam may have been a partner in it. 
Then is the argument that the Iraq war was about oil. It was. Fact. Whether right or wrong, the administration truly believed, especially after 9/11, that a terrorist state like Iraq controlling a huge piece of the world's oil would create domino effect and eventually lead to more middle eastern countries that control oil to fall under that ideation. That may not have been entirely accurate, but we've had similar reason for such large scale wars in the past. 
Fact is, it's time to stop blaming Bush for all of our problems. The sub-par me mortgage crap was because of legislation put forth by Clinton. The average family makes near the same now as they did under Bush, but are on harder times. I actually make more now than then, and am.on harder times. Our defense budget is less and taxes higher now than under Bush, but we have a yearly deficit that is 3 and 4 times what his was during his administration. He may have been a bumbling idiot.

We're forced to consider absurd joke candidates as being 'serious contenders' who play to the extreme base yet are obviously unelectable.  It's openly acknowledged that running for the republican nomination is a great way to springboard into a well paying position on Fox News or the conservative speech circuit.

What was supposed to be the driving philosophy behind the republican party, the neocon movement, has been completely discredited by the failures of the Bush administration.  But the only counter movement to form a new ideological direction for the party has been the Tea Party, which is an incoherent combination of knee-jerk anti-government libertarianism that borders on anarchism, and a pro-religious streak that borders on a push for theocracy.  All that's left animation the party is blind opposition to anything Obama says and does.

That isn't the move of a leader.  Also he's going to get hammered over the abortion issue as he's come out pretty strongly pro-life.

Paul also has major issues as a candidate.  Not as badly as his father, with a Ron Paul supporter you can talk to them for about 5 minutes and everything they say will sound great.

1760,"Before I dismiss a Biden candidacy out of hand I will say that Biden, generally speaking, polls well as a good ""second choice"" (better than Bernie Sanders most days) if only because people know who he is. But Biden has two (and a half) big things working against him.

One, he's old. If elected to the presidency he would be 74 years old on inauguration day, which is 4 years older than the next oldest president sword into a first term (Reagan was 2 weeks shy of his 70th birthday on his inauguration day). If he served two terms, he'd be 82 when the next President was sworn in. And while his mother may have lived to be 93 and his dad may have lived to be 87, the average life span for a healthy American male is 76. That means he'd almost certainly be a one term president, and the Democrats can't really take that risk. (Hillary on the other hand will be just over 69 on inauguration day with a life expectancy of about 82. Bernie Sanders meanwhile is already 73 and will be 75 on inauguration day.)

One half is that he's Obama's VP. Obama is popular among Democrats but wildly unpopular among independents and conservatives. Hillary can distance herself somewhat from Obama's domestic agenda and his politics because she was the chief diplomat and she's been out of office for a couple of years. Biden meanwhile has been there the whole time in lockstep (publicly, at least) with Obama's agenda the whole time. The public wants a new president with new ideas. They don't want an Obama third term.

This is why I've been so skeptical of this whole Bernie Sanders circle jerk. He's so far left that I can't help but think he's full of shit. And even if he's got some kind of plan to make all these pipe dreams a reality, the Reps in Congress will never, EVER work with him to make it happen.

It is a bit of a ""good cop, bad cop"" routine, isn't it? I suppose we can blame everything on the bad cop and imagine that if only if the good cop had total power none of this would ever happen, but I think the reality is that the good cop and the bad cop are always essentially working together. 

The system works on faith, we have faith that our politicians are doing everything they can to move things in our favor, in the direction we believe in, but because of this ""good cop, bad cop"" routine, we can never be sure what the real motives were behind all of the compromises and policy choices that went against stated values. I think it is because we have so little to go on but faith that politics has become little more than a popularity and personality contest. We hope Obama is a good person, we hope Clinton is, but we don't really know because everything they do is interpreted in the shadow of the ""good cop, bad cop"" routine. They are just the good cop trying to make the best of a situation largely driven by the bad cop we reason.

But the point is that Obamacare in its current iteration is better than nothing at all. Is it ideal? No. But if Obama hadn't compromised at all on any points then it would never have passed, and we would have gotten no progress instead of some progress.

And while Obama had a more favorable congress and senate at the time ACA passed, he didn't have such an overwhelming majority that they could push anything they wanted through. Compromise is necessary to get anything passed, no matter the state of congress or the senate.

Also, you have to remember that Sanders also had a left-wing government when Obama passed the ACA, and yet Sanders was unable to pass anything then either.

So while you're right that the current republican-dominated government does explain Sanders' (or any left-wing legislator's) inability to pass anything now, it does not explain his inability to pass anything *even when we had a democrat-dominated government* in the past.

He has not shown the ability to compromise or propose reasonable bills that garner enough support from both sides of the aisle to pass, no matter who is in control of the government.

How does proposing legislation that won't pass benefit anyone?

Consider Obamacare. The ACA is far from a perfect solution, in large part due to the changes Obama was forced to make in order to get enough support from the right to get the bill passed.

So my question is, is the ACA better than nothing? I think yes. Because even though the original ACA bill, prior to republican concessions, is certainly better than the current iteration of the ACA, there is 0 chance in hell the original ACA bill passes.

So I think that the current ACA, albeit cut down due to concessions, is better than the nothing we would have if Obama refused to compromise.

The same principle applies to all bills. A bill that passes but is not ideal due to concessions made to the opposite side to get enough support is superior, in my mind, to a bill that is ideal but did not pass because the legislators were unwilling to compromise.

Most if not all of them do, to some extent.  But the last time someone did it, and then didn't follow through to the fullest extent, we got a lot of loud complaining about how Candidate Obama said this, but President Obama did that.

So while a lot of candidates do it, and many win because of it, it seems to generally be the case that if the pandering includes promises to do things (or showy attempts to do things) that simply can't be done realistically, people end up pissed off.

Those blank checks are being cashed for extremely low amounts. In fact, it is almost as though, if you aren't in Yemen hanging out with terrorists, you haven't been killed yet. 

Of course the idea that an American would never have been killed before by an alphabet agency if they thought they were engaging in espionage or terrorism is laughable. You may not know about it, but it has happened.

2014 the Senate changed hands, yes, but those results were predicted in 2012 because the states holding senatorial races skew right.

And the punditry predicted it would change hands again in 2016 for the same reasons.

And it should, because just as the collapse of Saigon did not happen in Black April, but in a political American decision to allow South Vietnam to fall after a decent interval, so also is the ongoing collapse rooted, not in the recent tactical mistakes of the White House, but in the grand strategic decision president Obama made when he assumed office.

&gt;This is the plan.  It would be crazy not to acknowledge it. To effectively combat ISIS  or whatever it morphs into next   president Obama would essentially have to retrace his steps and return to a posture very much like that of George W. Bush. But that would mean starting a 500 kilometer march eating crow every step of the way and hes not going to do it.

&gt;Deep in their hearts the Washington Post and the New York Times must realize they endorsed Obama precisely because they knew that when this moment came he would harden his heart and refuse to re-engage, except for show.  Since this is the plan,  the only effective strategy, the only sane thing to do is to accept the liberal gambit and continue it.

&gt;The obvious continuation is not to dampen the sectarian conflict, but to exacerbate it to the greatest degree possible. America, like Britain in the Napoleonic age, should adopt the policy of supporting first one side then the other, or preferably both at once, so that the combatants inflict the maximum degree of damage on each other.

&gt;To be perfectly fair to president Obama, the  weapon of sectarian warfare was originally the brainchild of Abu Musab Zarqawi. Aided ironically by the Iranians, Zarqawi sponsored attacks on the Shiite population because Tehran cynically calculated a civil war would loosen the grip of the United States on post-Saddam Iraq.  The idea was that when America withdrew  Zarqawis gang  and Iran  would inherit the carpet of bodies.

&gt;By an extraordinary effort of will America beat the civil war back temporarily,  cementing it together with the the trust that people used to have in the good old USA , perhaps for the last time in history, forming a coalition in what was known as the Surge. But it did not last. With Obamas 2008 election, it was plain to the wicked and cunning old men in Turkey and Tehran that he would throw it away and that the conflict would continue as soon as he withdrew and they could inherit what was left.

&gt;The British empire in its heyday would have understood the logic perfectly. Thats how it advanced, setting one potentate against the other, one tribe against the next. But the American liberal elite was psychologically unable to follow the implications of their own handiwork to its logical conclusion, any more than they could acknowledge the boat people or victims of the Khmer Rouge were somehow connected to a support for Ho Chi Minh.  And so they pretended and temporized and spun and lied, until the time for lies was over.

&gt;To a cynic, what follows next is quite simple:  to be the winner stand back and watch while the Arabian peninsula, Levant and North Africa destroys itself. Take every opportunity to make it worse. Clearly a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented scale will result. Hundreds of thousands are already dead and millions of displaced persons are on the road. That will only grow in scale and number to millions of dead and tens of millions of refugees.  Therefore steps like preparing to sink the people smuggling boats, as the EU is doing, are in order.

We weren't winding down over there in 2010 or 2012 (when I was deployed), we were still doing active missions just like in 2005 that had NOTHING to do with security/handing over command.

IF Obama didn't want war over there, from day one, we would have been doing what took us to 2013/14 to DO, start handing over command.

You are so full of shit, and *obviously* know nothing more than a few 100/200's community college classes ...

Here is my theory.

We went over there, secured oil &amp; poppy seeds (pain killer medicine).

Obama came into office, realized (and agreed) that we need to keep it secure and setup our own export routes (military, private industry, CIA, doesn't matter ...) so he kept us there and now everything is set up and good to go.

I bet you by the end of his term, there are oil/nat-gas pipelines running through Syria into Europe.

AGAIN, **KID**, this is the *presidents* war ... if Obama wanted out of there, we would have been out of there by March 2009. If he wanted to leave it with *turnover* to the local militias and national police, we could have been out of there by Dec. 2009.

We train the best military in the world, our military police go through bootcamp for 8 weeks and then Police training for 4-8 months depending on service branch.  After that, they are very well trained in all the basics, only thing missing is OJT (on the job training).

So let me repeat myself again, child, and you are welcome to take notes.

If Obama (or Bush) wanted out of Middle East asap ... it could be done from 3 days (lets get the fuck out of here) to 8-9 months (lets train locals/nationals and then get the fuck out of here).

One, the article makes clear this is only in regards to the early primary season. So the comments here about how she'll ""eventually need them"" are doing a good job at missing the point. The article is arguing that she doesn't need the validity and name recognition that the media can provide and she's not going to ""feed the beast"" at this point because of how she feels about the media. 

&gt; She felt burned by the coverage of Clinton White House scandals and was convinced the media's affection for Barack Obama played a significant role in her defeat in the 2008 presidential primary

Two, the other interesting thing on the topic (that the article doesn't mention) is the clear perception that Clinton will win the primary easily.

The government would never ever ever ever ever guarantee a loan of about a quarter million dollars over 4 years to an 18 year old with no credit, but they do for student loans.  

If they didn't guarantee these loans, students would not be able to afford college, and universities would have to lower their prices.  Instead, kids  can ""afford"" it if their loan is guaranteed.  This lets universities get away with charging 50k a year for college, where in a normal market, lack of demand at the price-point of 50k would force the price much lower.  

Same reason the housing bubble started.  Federally guaranteed mortgages to people who weren't qualified, leads to false demand and then inflation... and then eventually bursts when they start defaulting.  In the case of the housing market the trading of derivatives exacerbated the problem. Despite what Obama tells you, trading derivatives was not the root cause of the housing bubble, guaranteed mortgages to people who weren't qualified is.

Bush had us on the right track . When Bush came in the DOW was around 1350 the budget was balanced and on track to completely eliminate the debt by 2010 (if the Bush administration would have behaved responsibly)...... America was at peace.

During ~~Bush's~~ Cheney's 8 years they ignored the warnings about the worlds largest terrorist attack which was perpetrated by 18 Arabs (lead by a son of long time Bush family friends ""The Bin Ladens""). In response they ginned up false intelligence about a completely unrelated country, started 2 wars, created the seeds of ISIS, ignored their financial oversight duties, (for ideological reasons), while the largest fraud based credit bubble festered, finally popping and causing a worldwide financial meltdown rivaling the great depression. In response ~~Bush~~ Cheney created the largest taxpayer funded bank bailout of the .01% in the history of the world.

When he left office the DOW was at 6500 (cut in half), the surpluses were squandered and the country was asshole deep in debt.... America was in a state of constant war. (to the eventual tune of 3 trillion dollars)

************************************************

.


What happens when the public does not wish to live out the utopian dreams of its elite leaders? Usually, the answer for those leaders is to seek more coercion and less liberty to force people to think progressively.

Here at home, President Obama came into power in 2009 with a Democratic Congress, a sympathetic press and allies in Hollywood, academia, unions and philanthropic and activist foundations.

Yet all that support was not sufficient to ensure ""correct"" public attitudes about Obama's agenda on health care, entitlements, taxes, guns, abortion and cultural issues.

In the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats forfeited their majority in the House. In the 2014 midterms, they lost their Senate majority and also lost ground in state legislatures and with governorships across the country. Since early 2013, Obama's approval rating has been consistently below 50%.

How, then, do politically correct planners force the people to think and act properly when they push back?

Extra-legal executive orders can help a president bypass supposed troglodytes in Congress and among the public.

Obama granted blanket amnesties, proposed rules that would lead to the closure of many coal plants and arbitrarily chose which health or labor statutes should be enforced and at what times.

A filmmaker was even jailed on a trumped-up probation charge after making a video about Islam that was deemed unhelpful to the official administration Benghazi narrative. The IRS hounded nonprofit groups considered insufficiently progressive.

In a recent rant about conservative Fox News  which has a fraction of the combined audience of the liberal networks ABC, CBS and NBC  Obama warned that the media are going to have change the very way they report news.

Presumably, Obama believes that Fox tricks the unknowing masses into thinking wrong thoughts, especially about the relationship between the poor and government assistance.

As Obama put it: ""We're going to have to change how our body politic thinks, which means we're going to have to change how the media reports on these issues, and how people's impressions of what it's like to struggle in this [economy looks like.""

Given the First Amendment, how can the president ""change"" the media? Should the Federal Communications Commission pick and choose acceptable news outlets in the same manner that Lois Lerner ran her exempt-organizations division at the IRS? Who would judge whether the media had changed to meet Obama's notion of correctness?

Hillary Clinton is worried that too many people have incorrect thoughts about feminist issues. For those who oppose abortion, Clinton believes that these supposedly wrong thoughts must be policed. ""Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases,"" she warned, ""have to be changed.""

How, in a free society, does Clinton plan to alter the way religion and culture work? What power would she need to rid us of these ""deep-seated"" but unhelpful ""codes and beliefs""?

Clinton recently declared that if elected president, she would pick Supreme Court nominees by the litmus test of demanding that they oppose the Citizens United ruling. She is apparently still furious at the high court's 2010 decision that dismantled federal election rules restricting independent political expenditures by nonprofit organizations.

Citizens United, remember, was a conservative nonprofit group that produced an unflattering movie about Clinton. The Federal Election Commission went to court to prevent the film from airing on TV before the 2008 Democratic primaries. In other words, Clinton wishes to judge the qualifications of future Supreme Court nominees on whether they agree a nonprofit organization had no right to be critical of her in a documentary at election time.

If Clinton is really worried about the role of big money in politics, she would have done better to have insisted that the Clinton Foundation did not solicit donations from foreign governments while she was the secretary of state.

She might have ensured that her family's foundation distributed 90% of its expenditures -- instead of a reported 10%  directly to the charities it claimed to help, especially given that it has raised close to $2 billion.

Clinton might also have blasted former presidents seeking hefty lecture fees and family foundation donations from wealthy entrepreneurs who hope to buy access and influence from either a sitting secretary of state, a former president  or a future president.

Or, Clinton herself might have cut back on lucrative speaking fees, often paid by wealthy corporations seeking influence. Bill and Hillary Clinton have pulled in $30 million in lecture cash in just the last 16 months. Mysteriously, the closer Clinton got to announcing her bid for the presidency, the more frequent and the more lucrative the Clinton duo's lecturing became.

When news organizations, judges or Americans in general do not think or speak in the correct fashion, then elite progressives believe they must do whatever is necessary to silence them  while making themselves exempt from their own agendas.

1991,"In what ways did W Bush personally make money from the invasion of Iraq?  You brought this up before, I asked before, you still haven't answered yet still make this claim.  

When W Bush left office Iraq was stabilizing, it was looking better, and things were generally going well.  Then Obama was in office, he did something notably capturing/killing Bin Laden.  ISIS then went on to gain power and do its own thing, meanwhile Obama did nothing but continue his troop scale backs.

ISIS has a long history, not always known as ISIS.  They were founded in 1999 as ""Jamat al-Tawd wa-al-Jihd"" (yeah I had to look up the spelling on that).  1999 is during Clintons time, before W Bush was ever in the presidential office.  Then ISIS truly came about as we know them today in 2013 when they started claiming territory in Levant.  Since then ISIS has had about two years of only mildly opposed (by the US military) reign of multiple nations trying to form there own nation and establish a Caliphate.

If you notice the timeline here, the formation of the original core group happened before W Bush.  The formation ISIS as we know it today happened after W Bush.  
If we can singularly blame W Bush for that, we can blame him for literally anything.  All the stuff in Syria, Libya, etc can all be blamed on W Bush because he destabalized the region and brought more support to the terrorist groups around there.  

I am not saying, nor have I ever in any of these statements said W Bush is without some blame in the matter.  He clearly was responsible for going into Iraq.  My very first post on the matter if you go back says as much.  Though I still maintain Obama had more of a direct influence on the formation of ISIS as we know it today than Bush ever did.  It happened under his presidency in 2013 to today, it occurred in large part because of his campaign promises/strategy of mass troop withdrawls from Iraq/the middle east creating a power vacuum especially in the wake of the death of Bin Laden which he also oversaw personally.  
Obama had the power and was in the position to do something about ISIS before it exploded into what it is today, he did not.  With that in mind if we have to blame a singular person/political figure I would say Obama hands down.  

I am not sure how much more of a well reasoned argument I can present.  So I guess this is basically it.  My forehead has hit this wall enough for my tastes, good day.

Bush in 2008. It established that U.S. combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and all U.S. combat forces will be completely out of Iraq by December 31, 2011.[1] The pact required criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and required a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that were not related to combat.[1] U.S. contractors working for U.S. forces would have been subject to Iraqi criminal law, while contractors working for the State Department and other U.S. agencies would retain their immunity. If U.S. forces committed still undecided ""major premeditated felonies"" while off-duty and off-base, they would have been subjected to an undecided procedures laid out by a joint U.S.-Iraq committee if the U.S. certified the forces were off-duty.[2][3][1][4]

I agree that some level of compromise is essential to human interaction of every level. Even driving on highways, people have to compromise their speed and position and travel time for others, effortlessly and without words or knowing where the other person is going or what they're doing. 

For me personally, I'm being ""My way or the highway"" as a sort of initial bid in my political leanings. You always start higher/stronger than you actually want/are in negotiations so you've got actual room to negotiate.

This may have something to do with the fact that the PPACA enabled 12 million Americans to gain health insurance and the plurality of these Americans now support both Congressmen that oppose repeal and the program.

Obama said repeatedly that Al Qaeda *central*, in Afghanistan, had been badly injured, but that there were other huge threats, like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which was the group who made this attack.   

I think that a lot of this, from the Republican side, was an attempt to push a ""obama is weak on national defense"" narrative in 2012.  It didn't at all stick; especially a year after the death of bin Laden, there was no way the public was going to buy that.  But that was why they tried to spin this into a huge issue.

&gt;They did not think it was a spontaneous uprising. 

You keep repeating that, but on the day it happened, intelligence services did think at the time there was a spontaneous aspect to it, encouraged by terrorist forces.  Again, we have quite a bit of written evidence that that is what the CIA thought at the time. Note that there was also a mass protest in Egypt the same day that ended up posing a threat to the US embassy in Egypt, and that one was entirely created by the video, so this wasn't a totally absurd think for the CIA to think, either (especially sine they apparently didn't have any assets on the ground in that area of Libya at the time).

&gt;Of course it helps that most of the press is on their side

I don't think that's even close to true; if anything, the mainstream press gave the various Benghazi conspiracy theories more attention then they really deserved, and they spent way more time on the Hilary e-mail story then that actually deserved, ect.

I'm aware of the fact that trade agreements revolve around executive-congressional agreements, but it's not the black-and-white legal issue that you appear to assume here.  There are several constitutional issues surrounding Free Trade and Fast Track authority.  I shouldn't have to tell you that such a breach represents a major legal no-no.  In addition to what this article points out, Fast tracking any form of legislation purely for the unilateral benefit of a special interest group, like multinational corporations and the plutocrats who control the lion's share of them, could be construed as a violation of the 5th Amendment's Due Process Clause since it represents a legislative vetting and amendment process double standard...a major Constitutional no-no.  

Here's some [background into the legal arguments surrounding executive-congressional agreements (see page 5)](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-896.pdf).  The initial legal challenge never made it to SCOTUS.  The third legal reason in this citation caught my eye as it validated these agreements on the basis that Free Trade was good for the country.  That legal reasoning is baseless since Free Trade has created nothing but economic problems for the U.S. from the onset, economically speaking.  This consequence effectively nullifies the court's concerns that invalidating trade agreements is ""bad for the U.S."". 

As someone who has worked with the people who are aggressively pushing Free Trade in the U.S. for decades, I'm more than a little familiar with the overly aggressive legal stances they are not shy about employing when it comes to their pursuit of money.

Now Warren's fan club, who are finally starting to learn that ""no means no"" are splitting their vote between Hillary and Bernie, and that sounds about right. Now Hillary is starting to poll in the high 60's and low 70's. Barring a major fuck up of epic proportions, Hillary is untouchable.

There are those who will bring up how in 2008 Hillary was the presumed candidate and that she was beaten back then by Obama. Now, there's a ton of reasons why that comparison isn't appropriate not the least of which being that Hillary now has a 5 year stretch as Secretary of State under her belt. But the real reason is because at about this time Hillary was polling in the mid-30's and Obama was polling in the mid 20's with at least 2-3 other challengers of quality. Any unpartial observer would have concluded that Hilary was in a very strong position to win but was very much not untouchable.

Someone might think that all Hillary needs is strong competition. And while that might be true, it's important to remember that Hillary '08 wasn't beaten by a man -- she was beaten by a movement. Bernie Sanders doesn't have a movement; he has a fan club. That makes him a lot more like Dennis Kucinich '08 than Barack Obama '08. And her other possible future competitors (who will likely be announcing in the next week or so) have all the charisma and draw of a cold bowl of soggy oatmeal. The wonky law and order technocrat types might like O'Malley and the blue dogs might like Jim Webb and like the 4 people in Rhode Island who have heard of him will like Lincoln Chafee. But that's not a whole lot of Dems. More likely than not these guys are auditioning for Hillary's cabinet and won't be launching a serious offense.

2132,"The Democrats obviously did not win the popular vote in that many states or in House Districts. They only carried the big cities by huge margins. They lost in 80% of America.

There will be no rule on Gerrymandering from the Judicial Branch. Why? The whole point of the Electoral College is to ensure that the popular vote for the president does not elect our president. This is a founding principle in our Constitution. Our Constitution guarantees the states the right to Gerrymander themselves (as long as there is no racist intent). Gerrymandering has always been part of our system of government, as our president once said, ""elections have consequences"".

It is not practical for the GOP to Gerrymander, it really only worked for Democrats. Republicans can and do get minor advantages when they can, but it is the Democrats who benefit on a large scale from it. Gerrymandering is when you divide small parts of a big city into large rural districts so that the rural voters are disenfranchised. It doesn't really work in reverse. You cannot Gerrymander with rural districts to turn Philadelphia red because this only turns the rural districts blue. You can however take 25% of Philadelphia's Democrats into rural Districts and *still win* in Philadelphia.

The Democrats are only popular in a few highly populated area (cities). Romney won in 80% of our counties. Obama took 20%. You cannot *fairly* redistrict America to get a Democrat House, you have to get the majority of the vote in fairly drawn districts, and Democrats cannot do this. Obama and the Democrats have strong urban support but have no support elsewhere. For this reason they will never be able to control the government again until they broaden their geographic appeal.

In addition to the Patriot Act stuff that's been going on, the Senate narrowly voted down the [Freedom Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3361), which would have stopped some kinds of domestic surveillance, like bulk phone metadata collection, and improve FISA court ""oversight,""  but allowed other forms of domestic surveillance to continue.

Citation needed. 

&gt;As such, they don't trust the government. 

So you're spinning the narrative that because they're rugged individual types they don't like the government? Maybe it's because of a 40 year long conservative trend to paint the government an entity that steals from people who look like them and gives it to those brown people who are invading our country. 

I think this is the far more likely scenario than your ""they're more rugged and independent"" explanation .

&gt; When President Obama went to Montana, to a small rural ranching community, to sell the Affordable Care Act, he completely misjudged the people. 

What evidence do you have of him misjudging the people? Or really making any judgment. Again, the far more likely scenario is that being a political veteran he's not completely unaware that rural people are more conservative and more ""states right"" federal government = bad types. It really seems like you're just spewing biased rhetoric disguised as commentary. 

&gt;  The federal government coming in and saying, ""Don't worry, we'll take care of you"" doesn't go over well. 

They Fox News framing you just gave the Affordable Care Act really shows your bias. I don't think that's an objective non partisan way to frame the creation of an insurance exchange. But that definitely is the Fox News way to frame it. I assume your out is ""that's not the wya I view it, I'm just saying that's probably the way they view it since they're so rugged and individual."" But if that's the case, then the question is why are their perceptions so out of wack with reality. I bet conservative propaganda plays a part but that doesn't seem to fall in line with your ""their independent individualist"" narrative.

&gt; These are people who, from their view, get screwed over by the EPA, the BLM, the USFS, and other federal agencies there to take care. 

Getting screwed over by the EPA? BLM? Please tell me how the EPA BLM screws rural people. I am really honestly curious. Or how they can view the EPA and their day to day life connected enough to think about it as a source for their daily life. Because otherwise this just sounds like Fox News simple narrative of ""farmers hurt by EPA"" as opposed to reality. 

&gt; Many people in rural America work jobs for barely more than what they could collect in welfare and food stamps. That's who they are. 

Citation needed. Your bias is becoming obvious now. Your spewing this ""rural rugged individualism"" ""hard worker"" ""don't collect food stamp"" narrative that is right out of Fox News. 

&gt; They don't trust Obama to care for them any more than they trusted Bush. 

Yes. They liked Bush, mostly because he was a republican, and hate Obama. Why are you pretending that their hate for liberal policies is rational (they're more rugged and takes less food stamps) and non-partisan (they're independent, they hate bush and Obama the same)?  

&gt;They would rather scrape by than to be dependent on the government. In many cases, it is in their genes.

And the last topping of ""they're not government moochers."" So to recap on your narrative of why rural people hate liberal policies it's because: They're independent strong white men that don't need no government, they work too much to earn food stamps, they hate Bush and Obama equally (did I mention they're independent).

2204,"Fuck paywalls.

Though imperialism is now held in disrepute, empire has been the default means of governance for most of recorded history, and the collapse of empires has always been messy business, whether in China and India from antiquity through the early 20th century or in Europe following World War I.

The meltdown we see in the Arab world today, with chaos in parts of North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Levant, is really about the final end of imperialism. The Islamic States capture of Palmyra, an ancient caravan city and one of the most visually stunning archaeological sites in the Near East, only punctuates this point. Palmyra represents how the region historically has been determined by trade routes rather than fixed borders. Its seizure by the barbarians only manifests how the world is returning to that fluid reality.

It is actually three imperial systems whose collapse we are now witnessing in the Middle East.

First, Middle Eastern chaos demonstrates that the region has still not found a solution to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. For hundreds of years, Sunnis and Shiites, Arabs and Jews, Muslims and Christians, in Greater Syria and Mesopotamia had few territorial disputes. All fell under the rule of an imperial sovereign in Istanbul, who protected them from each other. That system collapsed in 1918, unleashing the demon of national, ethnic, and sectarian disputes over who controls which territory at what border precisely.

Second, the implosion of Iraq in the wake of the toppling of Saddam Hussein, the implosion of Syria in the wake of the Arab Spring, and the rise of the Islamic State has brought to an end the borders erected by European imperialism, British and French, in the Levant.

Third, the demonstrably hands-off approach to these developments by President Barack Obama manifests the end of Americas great power role in organizing and stabilizing the region. And the United States, remember, since the end of World War II, has been a world empire in all but name. (Nobody, perhaps, makes this uncomfortable point more comprehensively than Oxford historian John Darwin in his 2007 book After Tamerlane: The Rise and Fall of Global Empires, 1400-2000.)

And it is not just imperial forces that have declined and left chaos in their wake. The fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, Muammar al-Qaddafi in Libya, and the reduction of Bashar al-Assads regime in Syria to that of an embattled statelet has ended the era of post-colonial strongmen, whose rule was organically connected to the legacy of imperialism. After all, those dictators ruled according to the borders erected by the Europeans. And because those imperial borders did not often configure with ethnic or sectarian ones, those dictatorial regimes required secular identities in order to span communal divides. All this has been brutally swept away.

Alas, the so-called Arab Spring has not been about the birth of freedom but about the collapse of central authority, which says nothing about the readiness of these states, artificial and otherwise, for the rigors of democracy.

Among the states affected by the current upset, two kinds have been discernible. First, there are the age-old clusters of civilization. These are places that have been states in one form or another going back as far as antiquity, and thus have evolved sturdy forms of secular identity that have risen above ethnicity and religious sect. Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt are the most striking in this category. If one looks at a map of Roman sites along the North African coast, one will see that the map is crowded with settlements where these countries are located, and relatively absent of settlements in the vast stretches in-between of Algeria and Libya. In other words, Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt are historically definable. Whatever tumult and regime changes they have experienced in the course of the Arab Spring, their identities as states have never been in question. And so the issues in these countries have been about who rules and what kind of government there should be, not about whether or not a state or central government is even possible.

The second group of Middle Eastern states is even more unstable. These take the form of vague geographical expressions and they are places with much weaker identities  and, in fact, many have identities that were invented by European imperialists. Libya, Syria, and Iraq fall most prominently into this category. Because identity in these cases was fragile, the most suffocating forms of authoritarianism were required to merely hold these states together. This is the root cause for the extreme nature of the Qaddafi, Assad, and Hussein regimes, which practiced levels of repressions far more severe than those of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia. Algeria, also an artificial state, essentially invented by the French, has experienced remote and sterile authoritarian rule, and now faces an uncertain transition given the declining health of its ruler, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has been in power since 1999. Jordan, too, is a vague geographical expression, but has enjoyed moderate governance through the genius of its ruling Hashemites and the overwhelming economic and security support this small country has received from the United States and Israel. Yemen may also be an age-old cluster of civilization, but one always divided among many different kingdoms due to its rugged topography, thus ruling the territory as one unit has always been nearly impossible.

Only suffocating totalitarian regimes could control these artificial countries formed from vague geographical expressions. When these regimes collapsed they left behind an utter void. For between the regime at the top and the tribe and extended family at the bottom, all intermediary forms of social and political organization were eviscerated long before by such regimes. Totalitarianism was the only answer to the end of Western imperialism in these artificial states, and totalitarianisms collapse is now the root cause of Middle East chaos.

Overlaying this meltdown of vague geographical expressions and the less severe weakening of age-old clusters of civilization has been the rise of indigenous regional powers such as Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. Iran is a great, old-world civilization on one hand and a ruthless and radicalized sub-state on the other. This is what accounts for its dynamic effectiveness around the region. A Persian empire has been based in one form or another on the Iranian Plateau since antiquity. Thus, rather than face political identity problems like the Arabs, Iranians are blessed with a cultural self-certainty comparable to that of the Indians and Chinese.

At the same time, however, the narrow assemblage of radical mullahs running the government of Tehran represent a sub-state akin to jihadi groups like the Islamic State, Hezbollah, al Qaeda, and the former Mahdi Army. Thus Iran is able to operate with unconventional flair. Iran has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, trained radical and militarized proxy forces in the Levant, and brilliantly conducted negotiations with its principal adversary, the United States. Thus does Iran partially inherit the void left by the disappearance of Ottoman, European, and American empires.

Whereas Iran is the Shiite node of power in the newly sectarian Middle East, Saudi Arabia is the Sunni node. Saudi Arabia, compared to Iran, is the artificial creation of a single extended family. The country the Saudi family governs does not territorially configure with the Arabian Peninsula to the extent that Iran configures with the Iranian Plateau. Nevertheless, the House of Saud has impressively navigated its way over the decades through immense social transformation at home and a tumultuous security situation abroad. And the recent high-level personnel changes engineered by the new king, Salman, including the replacement of the crown prince and foreign minister, indicates the absolute determination of this dynasty to readjust its policies in order not to let Iran dominate the region.

Saudi Arabias recent bombing campaign against Iran-backed Houthi tribesmen in Yemen and Riyadhs renewed intensification of support for anti-Iranian Syrian rebels (helped also by Turkey and Qatar) is a reaction to what Riyadh sees as an impending American-Iranian nuclear accord. Indeed, the Saudis are already factoring into their calculations the strong possibility of such a deal, and thus the bombing in Yemen and recent pressure on the pro-Iranian Assad regime in Syria represent  ahead of the actual fact  the post-nuclear accord Middle East. That accord, if it indeed happens, though limited to nuclear issues, will be viewed with some justification as the beginning of a more general American-Iranian rapprochement-of-sorts: in regional terms, that is, one declining imperial power coming to terms with a rising indigenous power.

To contain a post-accord Iran, the United States will need not only to bolster Saudi Arabia, but Egypt and Turkey as well. Egypts security services under de facto military strongman Abdel Fattah el-Sisi are already quietly allied with the Israeli security services in Gaza, Sinai, and elsewhere. America requires a strong Egypt  democratic or not  as a regional anti-Iran ally to bolster Saudi Arabia. While Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not normally viewed as a pro-American country, a strong Turkey in and of itself also helps balance against Iranian power. The jostling among these geographically and historically fortunate powers for regional dominance will define the new post-imperial order.",0,0.0419434033528,0.268441237131,0.441023126761,0.287984355237,1.775,1.0,1537,0.0801603206413,24.3968253968,0.4,0.375

I see centrists like Obama and Clinton as a path to getting more of what I want. Clinton in particular has a major adviser that will be in her ear every day -- President Bill Clinton. In fact, I predict it may become an issue during her presidency -- as the right wing takes issue with his level of involvement with her presidency. 

What we've seen with Bill and Obama is, there are things for liberals to criticize, certainly, but you're getting a lot of support for policy that is right on target with the base. Hillary, in the 90s, championed Healthcare reform that excluded the insurance companies. The HMOs spent a lot of money killing it. Between this, and Joe Lieberman, the HMOs were included this time around. Even so, the ACA has a lot of things going for it that liberals can be happy about. And it may even have a back door that leads us back to eventually excluding the insurance companies again -- the healthcare exchanges. 

On Foreign Policy, I think that while many people believe Hillary is a hawk, I expect her presidency to be similar to Bill's and have a body count (one metric for FP) lower than Obama's and much, much lower than Bush's (100,000+ Iraqis dead is hard to match, not that we should want to).  

The Supreme Court is another front where Bill and Obama have both done a good job of seating liberal, even anti-corporate (to an extent) justices. I see Hillary continuing this trend (obviously the first priority is someone who will be pro-choice, but I would be surprised if we don't get more nominees like Sotomayor).

I want to see Democrats run in the same elections as everyone else. That said, they've been good on campaign finance issues. Their justices in the SCOTUS dissented in *Citizens* (a case which was actually about Hillary so you know she has no love for it) and *McCutcheon*. Every Democrat Senator caucused for the **DISCLOSE Act** in 2010, but since every Republican Senator caucused against it, it never passed. 

I'd rather vote for someone who takes money and then governs well -- maybe even reforming the system to stop soft money, than someone who doesn't take money and never gets elected. 

&gt; I, too, would vote for Hillary over any republican, for the record.

And similarly, I would campaign for Bernie and vote for him if he is the nominee. I welcome moving to the left. But the truth might be that the left needs to stand together and be very, very patient for that to happen.

The great plains have the most outmigration and are the most conservative, appalachia and the deep south have less and mix some more democratic votes than are typical.

This is because anyone who does not have a stable job or family in a rural area that is bleeding has zero reason to remain there. The only people who move there do so for typically well paying jobs. 

People who have very stable jobs and family and also have a closed social network are likely to be more conservative. Again, this describes the kind of people who actually have reason to be in the empty part of North Dakota.

We've seen NSA spying continue and had revealed that Obama has only maintained or increases the illegal policies implemented under Bush.  Further eroding the 4th Amendment.

We've seen Obama continue our combat focus in Afghanistan, and very strong, barely resisted, attempts to get us more involved in Syria.  As well as very badly handled arming of rebels and exiting of Iraq which has led us to ISIS controling much of Syria and Iraq.

We've seen an administration filled with lobbyists and former industry insiders from places like Monsanto and Comcast forming policy for their very own industries, despite his promises to do the opposite.

We've seen more whistleblowers attacked by a President than any president in history, from an administration that promised to be the most transparent in history.

Speaking of transparency this President has also pressured congress to once again forgo their constitutional rights and allow him to push through the biggest trade deal in history, in complete secrecy.

They are forcing a woman to physically support another human being and then turning around and saying, ""sure we made a decision, but we don't have the responsibility to support you or the baby"".

&gt;Sure, ok, no one has an obligation to risk their own life for someone else. There are those who are anti-abortion who consider this legit, and are only for anti-abortion for abortions where the mothers life is not at risk. So when it comes to other abortions, where the issues are not life threatening, how does one decide what life gets trumped? What metric should one use?

All unattended labor is a risk that shouldn't be forced on women.  

You can't wait until she's in the middle of dying and then ask if she has enough money to get an emergency abortion.

If the state won't pay, they get no say.

&gt;Factual information? Sorry, the root cause of the increase in infant mortality in the US has not been discovered.

Give me any other theory.  Anything.  It always comes back to right-wing policy either in terms if shutting down women's health clinics (Rick Perry blocked federal funding to clinics that didn't even provide abortions to make himself look tough) or because of cuts to healthcare.

Not only that but in 2011, the republican controlled house PASSED a bill (hr358) whose only purpose was to remove the protection of medical law and triage from pregnant women alone.

This means that women suffering from ectopic pregnancies or complicated miscarriages (in both situations the embryo is dead or dying) could be legally abandoned to die by doctors or hospitals.

&gt; ""Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,"" Mr Obama said.

&gt; In his speech, Mr Obama said: ""The US has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people.

&gt; ""We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home... Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the US and Iraq, we have met our responsibility. Now, it is time to turn the page.""

&gt; Mr Obama said the drawdown in Iraq allowed the US military to divert resources to the fight in Afghanistan, where he said the US remained committed to defeating al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
But he reiterated the mission in that country would last ""a limited time"" before Afghan security forces would have to take over.

&gt; ""As was the case in Iraq,"" he said, ""we cannot do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves.""


It seems to me Mr. Obama, at least when he was specifically addressing the issue of troops leaving Iraq in the early part of his Presidency, made some points perfectly clear.  We are done fighting in Iraq, because the rest needs to be done by Iraqis, but we are not done fighting al Qaeda.

No surprise, I would rather hire people if I had more money in my pocket too. A flat tax raises taxes on the poor and lowers them for the rich--Harvard economists predict that would create 5 trillion dollars (that means our economy would grow by 1/3!). Also, it makes sense, would I rather work harder when half of it is washed down the toilet, or when 10% of it is taken? Would I work harder if my secretary gets a tax cut but me--the only reason she is in the workforce--gets a tax hike? Higher taxes discourages innovation, expansion, and economic growth. Its Econ-101.

**This year, American military officials had said they wanted a residual force of as many as tens of thousands of American troops to remain in Iraq past 2011 as an insurance policy against any violence.** Those numbers were scaled back, but the expectation was that at least about 3,000 to 5,000 American troops would remain.  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html

The thing is though, he is still (in theory) elected by and represents the interests of the people.  The people were war-weary and clearly wanted to pull out of Iraq, and Obama campaigned on this.  I mean, it's not like he hasn't said ""piss off"" to campaign promises before, but let's also not pretend that Obama didn't have the voices of millions of Americans behind him telling him they were tired of the Iraq War.

I'm not really sure continuing a war unwanted by the people is the better option, especially since simply postponing the withdrawal a little longer would have dubious positive effect.  At best, it kicks the can down the road and hopes things are better at the time we *are* ready to pull troops.

There weren't many good solutions to a problem that, yes, was primarily in the lap of the Bush Administration.

Kagan is a conflict of interest.  She was too political, too closely tied to politicians as well as political idealogy for us to reasonably expect an unbiased judicial opinion.  Nor does she have the experience necessary to hold the highest judicial office in the land, in my opinion.

What do you have against investment bankers making a bunch of money? If they have the ability to recognize opportunity and move money to fund that opportunity they are performing a very valuable service. They are getting paid by investors based on what they can earn for those investors.

2366,"&gt; Universal healthcare is possible to do correctly, we've seen it work in many other countries so far.

Countries that have far higher tax rates, have WAY less demand for healthcare (In the US we demand fast care, live much unhealthier than said nations, and honestly are just fickle and sickly. Here in the US every time we get a cold we go get to a doctor and want antibiotics. Partially because of higher wait times and higher PERSONAL cost they do not do this in other countries. They just let nature takes it course. In this country we simply OVER USE healthcare. This is a cultural problem and creating a public option only makes it a lot worse), and  these countries benefit from medical advances that were (and to a lesser extent 'are') made in the US. R&amp;D is expensive in medicine.


Also the ONLY nations that have a good public health option are
A) Much smaller nations. The larger the nation is cost grows much faster and no nation with a good public option is even 1/3 the size of the US and the best ones are well over 5% the size of this nation"". If you look at the larger public option countries like France and the UK---are all nearly fiscal problems and are seeing cutbacks already that will only increase with an ageing population.
B) Have very strict immigration policies. Places like Iceland, Sweden, Norway, etc are so 'anti-immigrant' they would be considered far-right radicals by even most Tea Party people. A fact liberals love to ignore.
The reason nations in Europe like the UK and France have been so 'accepting' of immigration is they simply need it. If they are getting large numbers of young people and maintain a consistent population increase the system collapses. It is a de fact Ponzi Scheme.

&gt; I've been paying into a system for 10+years and as far as I'm concerned I'm just getting back now what I've already put in

This seems to be a reference to taxes. I am sure you have 'paid into' 10+ years of taxes. So what? The money is gone. Spent. 
Government has been blowing through tax money for a long time. It is hilarious that when people face hard numbers and realize the money is simply not there because it has been spent they cry like you and think that some God of Fiscal Responsibility is going to come down and give everybody their money back.

&gt;It's helped many other hard working people who just couldn't afford healthcare for one reason or another.

Exactly my point. 
It has helped YOU. You give 2 shits about the millions of people with healthcare prices that skyrocketed because of it.
It has helped YOU because of government money which the government can't afford as it can't come close to paying its bills now, let alone the massive debt it already had, and the even larger coming soon expenses of the baby boomers demand their medicare and SS which the government can't come close to affording.

Yet you are happy to be an ignorant, near sighted fool and say ""Well it helps me NOW"". 

You like the $261 per month and have no reason to care about the fact the money is coming from an already broke government, that millions others are now losing healthcare or having to pay out the noise, and lastly ignoring that ACA is financially unstable and will not last more than 10-20 years.

Never implied you are a free loader. Not at all. There are tens of millions just like you and none are free loaders. The system is broken.

It is sad that all a politician has to do is hand out money (In your case $261) and make sure to get out of office before the bills come due and they get praise.

Nothing, as long as our economy and society are healthy enough to support it. The investment bankers aren't doing anything specifically wrong.

We need to incentivize corporations to invest in employees again. Specifically American employees, but employees in general.

2381,"Obama is not denying that they consider themselves Islamic. I mean, they're called the Islamic State, after all. 

He's trying to distance the religion itself from a group that has specific political and ideological agendas; a group that justifies its ambitions using religious texts, but that's equally motivated by power and chasing historic glory. 

Hypothetically, a Christian group could start endorsing slavery too:

""Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.""
- Titus 2:9-10

""Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.""
- 1 Peter 2:18

And, especially if you included the Old Testament, you could start preaching some lousy things about infidels, women, gays, etcetera. But, most Christians would argue that this isn't in the true spirit of Christianity - and all that really means is that it doesn't reflect how modern Christianity has come to be practiced. And they'd use the same language as Obama: ""They're not Christian"". 

So that's what Obama is trying to do. And his motivation is strategic. Since there are billions of Muslims in the world, it makes more sense to rally them to our side against the extremists, then to attack a massive religion *itself*. I don't get why that's so hard for some folk to understand. 

He's trying to undermine recruitment, and the right-wing attitude (no matter how much you think you're just calling a spade a spade) that Islam itself is the problem is feeding right into the narratives of these extremists. The more the right rails against Islam, the more the US seems anti-Islam, the more credibility the extremist narrative has.

You're tragically mistaken.  TPP worsens the worst of Free Trade exponentially.  It's no different than trying to put out a fire with gasoline...it magnifies the problems rather than minimizing them.

For the record, I don't oppose capitalism.  Instead, I oppose reckless, self-destructive and irresponsible forms of capitalism.  Unfettered capitalism is a major problem since it suffers from more than a few counter-productive elements that pose a mortal threat to healthy economic activity.

Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use.[55] Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo.[56] Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an amicable agreement.[57]

""Fair use"" is determined by how much a new work changes an older one. At first Fairey claimed he used the photo of Clooney and Obama and cropped the actor out of the shot and made changes.

In February 2009, Fairey filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright.[58]

In October 2009 Shepard Fairey admitted he had tried to deceive the Court by destroying evidence that he had instead used the photograph alleged by the AP.

Fairey admitted he had used a close-up shot of Obama, also taken by Mannie Garcia, as the AP had long alleged. The solo photo appears much more similar to the final HOPE poster than the photo of Clooney and Obama.

Fairey's lawyers announced they were no longer representing him, and Laurence Pulgram, an intellectual property lawyer, stated that the revelation definitely put Mr. Fairey's case ""in trouble"".[59][60] In May 2010, a judge urged Fairey to settle.[61] The parties settled in January 2011.[62]

On February 24, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court for ""destroying documents and manufacturing evidence.""[63][64]

On September 7, 2012, Fairey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, ordered to pay a $25,000 federal fine, and placed on probation for two years by U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas.[65]

2486,"&gt;Then you're not counting all the votes. 

I'm counting all of the eligible votes. Neither of us is counting **all** the votes, which would include votes from people in other countries, votes from children, votes in straw polls before the primaries, etc. 

I'm counting all the votes that were part of the 2008 Democratic primary - you want to include some votes that were not part of that.

&gt;Why are we disqualifying MI again?

We are disqualifying MI because the MI Democratic party violated the rules for scheduling a primary. Obama withdrawing is a result of that, not a cause; Obama chose to not compete in an unofficial, against the rules primary.

&gt;  They did nothing to be disqualified except live in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I can't find if the primary was open or closed, but in either case they did more than that. If it was a closed primary then they were members of a party that chose to violate the rules. If it was an open primary they aren't tied as closely to the party, but they still chose to vote in a non-official primary. In either case, they are not being punished for nothing; they are being punished as a result of actions by the state Democratic party, which is the representative of the state to the national Democratic party

If I go out and throw my own primary vote, would we expect the national party to include all those votes?

&gt;Now you're just being an asshole. My comments, my unedited comments are just upthread from here:

The comment I'm referring to is: ""Or how about the 2008 Democratic Primary, where Hillary won the popular vote?""

But Hillary did not win the popular vote in the 2008 Democratic Primary. If we add in unofficial votes from Michigan that were not part of the 2008 Democratic Primary, then she got more votes. If we judge by the votes cast in the actual 2008 Democratic Primary, then Obama got more.",1,0.232548701299,0.234916146598,0.524107142857,0.260837405218,0.787878787879,0.766666666667,344,0.0326086956522,20.2352941176,0.35,0.433333333333

I'm glad you totally failed to address the public money part. Hey, it's not like it's an important point or anything. Democrats never argue the ""public money"" angle or the ""public accommodation"" angle in philosophical arguments anyway. ^/s

The truth is that they tried to punish the State's voters based on the action of the GOP dominated [Michigan Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Democratic_primary%2C_2008), not the Michigan DNC. (Debbie Dingell had strong opinions but no role in the state government.)

When we tally the popular vote, remember what you said. He, ""chose to not compete"". Had it been an involuntary action you *might* have an argument.

&gt;The comment I'm referring to is: ""Or how about the 2008 Democratic Primary, where Hillary won the popular vote?""

This is exactly like reading only ***half*** of my reply and then getting angry about what I *didn't say* in the half you decided to read. 

&gt;...unofficial, against the rules primary.

It was the official, one and only Michigan primary. That the date violated DNC party rules makes no difference unless and until the DNC can dictate orders to a State government. Again, if the DNC wants to run their very own primary in Michigan with their own money, more power to them. They can then make up any rules they want as far as I'm concerned.

It's also worth noting that the Michigan delegates were seated and were given their full original tally in votes, eventually. Didn't matter, because the ""Super Delegates"" picked the winner of the DNC primaries in a smokey back room, using a process that can only be described as ""Not Democratic"".

As much as I hear Democrats whine and bitch and moan about the ""popular vote"", the winner is decided by delegate counts and the popular vote total only needs to be ""cooked"" for propaganda purposes.

&gt;I'd like to get you to see just how electable Hillary actually is (despite what Reddit and Fox would like to have people believe).

&gt;This is without considering how well Obama has performed in the eyes of your average American (he brought the country out of a major recession and two wars as opposed to bringing it into them). Even the unpopular ACA has been successful at what it sought out to do so far (and it ended up costing less than anticipated).

&gt;Couple that with a crippling Democrat defeat in 2014 (which will bolster Democrat support and keep some Republicans at home), a (so far) unpopular Republican congress, fighting within the GOP, and increased support for populist policies (more and more people are starting to see that the cards are stacked against your average person) which the GOP has little hope to compete against the Democrats at, I see this upcoming election as Hillary's to lose (as long as the country doesn't take a turn for the worst before then).

Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use.[55] Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo.[56] Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an amicable agreement.[57]

""Fair use"" is determined by how much a new work changes an older one. At first Fairey claimed he used the photo of Clooney and Obama and cropped the actor out of the shot and made changes.

In February 2009, Fairey filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright.[58]

In October 2009 Shepard Fairey admitted he had tried to deceive the Court by destroying evidence that he had instead used the photograph alleged by the AP.

Fairey admitted he had used a close-up shot of Obama, also taken by Mannie Garcia, as the AP had long alleged. The solo photo appears much more similar to the final HOPE poster than the photo of Clooney and Obama.

Fairey's lawyers announced they were no longer representing him, and Laurence Pulgram, an intellectual property lawyer, stated that the revelation definitely put Mr. Fairey's case ""in trouble"".[59][60] In May 2010, a judge urged Fairey to settle.[61] The parties settled in January 2011.[62]

On February 24, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court for ""destroying documents and manufacturing evidence.""[63][64]

On September 7, 2012, Fairey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, ordered to pay a $25,000 federal fine, and placed on probation for two years by U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas.[65]

2547,"I will gladly elaborate. First of all, the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is that while the Republicans have NO ONE interested in helping out the middle class and the poor, the Democrats have Barry Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and a few others. Maybe half a dozen in Congress, total. But that still puts them well ahead of the Republicans.

Second, Obama's bailout was a success. Its intended goal was to halt the tailspin the economy was in and to help the economy recover fast. It did that. It also got the banks out of the mess they had created, but that was a side effect. Also, most of the money given in the bailout has been paid back.

Where Obama failed was in not also helping out all the middle class and poor homeowners who were hurt by the crash. Obama and his Democratic colleagues little or nothing to help out average Americans in that respect. There was a fund set up to help middle class homeowners, but it wasn't a big fund in relation to the banks, it was very slow to pay out and didn't actually get much done. A halfhearted effort, at best, of which Obama and the Democrats should be deeply ashamed. What's more, if the Democrats and/or Obama HAD made a real effort to help middle class homeowners, you can be SURE that the Republicans would have been howling like dogs about the expense of it.

Obama's deepest failure may have been in the area of justice: his justice department, presumably under his orders, refused to criminally prosecute any individuals for what they had done. They just prosecuted bank buildings and fined them what was for them small change. This was a huge moral failure on Obama's part, basically saying ""It's OK to be a criminal if you're a big enough criminal."" I was disgusted by it.

Imagine if half of the [41%](#s ""vote Obama got in Texas in 2012"") of Texas's 27 million people moved out of the state (a little less than 6 million).  Sure, the state would be 100% Republican, but it wouldn't be worth 38 electoral votes anymore (maybe 7-ish votes less).

Obviously that is bad math because Texas only had about 8 million votes cast out of an eligible pool of 18,279,737 (3.3 million for Obama in 2012).

But 1.6 million **actual voters** could sway a lot of states (and also increase those state's electoral value).  Other than Texas, the largest margin Romney won over Obama was Tennessee.

The American workforce surmise they've been getting screwed when the wealthy have gone from rich to obscenely rich, whose intelligence, hard work *and increased control of govt*  paid off, but not in proportion to their contribution.   They took advantage of the increases of efficiency within the system *for which they are not solely responsible*.  Some of those increased efficiencies have been by reducing regulations and protections and the polluted wastelands of Asia and lack of adequate savings for many Americans are testament to that.

Its been 25 years since school...by the time I was done, I was pretty cynical.  Prompted by my Professor,  our research correctly surmised we would have cyclical and increasingly more devastating bubbles and crashes.  One of my frat brothers who works in investments confided: 'we expect a bubble about every 10-12 years now, it will be pushed up, the big boys have the edge to pull out and buy back in when it is low.  That's a gross oversimplification, but the fact that many high level stockbrokers view it this way is beyond disturbing.   No one wants to talk about the fact that in 2009 the market should have leveled off about 900...but was pushed down into the 600's in order to get back the losses the big boys incurred ...and scare Obama. 


There's a new ethos:  we do not have to share the wealth.  An arguable point, but unfortunately perception is reality, and the perception is workers are getting screwed.  It's interesting, we will bend over backwards to support a brutal dictatorship with resources, but our own workers deserving a proportional increase of the larger pie they baked are ""takers"".

 Mid 20th century reformist  capitalists correctly surmised vast, concentrated wealth is inherently dangerous to democracy.  Today's economists think it's a good thing.  Bill Gates walks into a bar, woopie, we're all statistically richer!

 As I like to point out,  Adam Smith did not invent happiness.  He just showed it can be damn more accessible.  Unfortunately greed means people are told to take more more more or they won't be happy... and it worked.  Look at the behavior on Black Fridays.  You can't blame liberals or communism for it.


Sorry that's a long, windy bit veering off the minimum wage and the methods with which we legislate against poverty.   Hopefully those expanded ideas are clear.

Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use.[55] Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo.[56] Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an amicable agreement.[57]

""Fair use"" is determined by how much a new work changes an older one. At first Fairey claimed he used the photo of Clooney and Obama and cropped the actor out of the shot and made changes.

In February 2009, Fairey filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright.[58]

In October 2009 Shepard Fairey admitted he had tried to deceive the Court by destroying evidence that he had instead used the photograph alleged by the AP.

Fairey admitted he had used a close-up shot of Obama, also taken by Mannie Garcia, as the AP had long alleged. The solo photo appears much more similar to the final HOPE poster than the photo of Clooney and Obama.

Fairey's lawyers announced they were no longer representing him, and Laurence Pulgram, an intellectual property lawyer, stated that the revelation definitely put Mr. Fairey's case ""in trouble"".[59][60] In May 2010, a judge urged Fairey to settle.[61] The parties settled in January 2011.[62]

On February 24, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court for ""destroying documents and manufacturing evidence.""[63][64]

On September 7, 2012, Fairey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, ordered to pay a $25,000 federal fine, and placed on probation for two years by U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas.[65]

At a high level...


Yes, health care costs were going up before and after ACA. But look at the jumps in the before and after. Many people have seen deductibles double or triple. ""Like your insurance keep your insurance"" was a bullshit line that got the suckers to support it. ACA plans are decidedly worse than pre ACA plans middle class people had. Whats worse is soon we'll also get to be taxed on them. So yeah, fuck ACA, fuck Obama and fuck all his knuckle dragging supporters. 


Minimum wage without question hurts everyone making more than minimum wage. Firstly, if you made 15 an hour when minimum wage was 5 and the minimum goes up to 10, you are now that much closer to the bottom. Even worse, business passes the costs on to consumers. So when the business has to pay more in labor then just raise prices a bit. Which means that now your cost of living goes up. Certainly not by a large amount, but the fact remains minimum wage hurts everyone but the least successful in society.


The big confusion is in the presentation of how the rich hurt the system. You see, the liberals have brainwashed people into thinking if a government hasnt *taken* money from you, its the *same thing* as if the government *gives* you money. Thats decidedly a lie. If the government gives a tax break to a rich person that indivudual simply gets to keep more of what he has. The government hasnt *given* him money. Conversely if the government sends a check to a poor person the government has *given* that person money he was not in any way entitled to.

Was the economy starting to improve on Jan 19, 2009?

Was the economy starting to improve under George W. Bush?

Did the economy regress after Jan 20, 2009?

Did the economy improve despite Obama becoming president?

The questions are phrased to elicite an emotional response, not a factual one. To the restaurant worker who lost his job to an illegal alien the economy hasn't got an better. The question also implies Obama did something to improve the economy and, since the survey purposely over sampled Republicans, inserting his name is fishing for a negative answer. The question also has patently vague parameters. Which sector of the economy got better? How much better? Better from when? What starting point? Better since 1930? Since 1990? May 3, 2006? Better for who? The middle class? Farmers? Homeless?

Instead you peel off New Hampshire. It's 4EV, which is exactly what you need to win, and Obama's margin of victory was only 5.5%. In terms of actual votes, that's about 45,000 people you need to flip, which is a stupidly small number of votes.

2636,"I'm going to step in here and explain why everyone is freaking out saying Social Security is going bankrupt.

First.  Yes.  The entire Social Security Trust Fund was used to expand the budget for decades.  All that remains in the coffers is Special Issue Treasury Bonds.  We owe ourselves about 3 Trillion Dollars, not including other intragovernmental debt.  Regardless of what people tell you.  You cannot owe yourself money, be broke, and simultaneously have that money.  It isn't possible.  As Social Security goes into negative numbers, the money from the Trust Fund will have to be borrowed on a yearly basis, increasing the deficit, as we do not have the money and the forecast is for budget deficits as far as the eye can see.

But honestly, the real problem isn't social security.  We can deal with Social Security as a single problem.  The big problem is Medicare and Medicaid. These programs weren't designed to deal with the current medical world we live in, where people live longer, and get to use all the wondrous medical technology we have invented.  Not to mention the sweetheart deals we give Big Pharma, and the COMPLETE failure of healthcare reform.  I'm sure most people don't understand. What we got from the Affordable Care Act was the POLAR OPPOSITE of why Obama tried to press through Healthcare Reform.  It was supposed to drive down costs significantly, but the Health Insurance Lobby under their lead negotiator Karen Ignagni completely reneged on the deals she made with Obama.  So Obama had to pass something as far too much political capital had been expended to back off...

According to  the Congressional Budget office.  By 2030, all we will be able to afford with our income is Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt.  Everything else will have to be borrowed.  Military. Highways. Coast Guard.  Whatever pet project you like that the Federal Government does...  NASA, NOAA&lt; whatever... Everything else will be borrowed. Everything.

By 2050.  All we will be able to afford is the interest on the debt.

Can you comprehend what they are saying?

Some debt is good.  We are long past that point.  The time for action was honestly about 2 decades ago.  It isn't about finding a way out of our problem anymore.  It is about making the catastrophe as small as possible.  We are well past the point of no return.  We have some very tough choices to make.

But nothing is being done.  And nothing will be done.  Until the last minute.  Because to do something now would be political suicide.  And the politicians are far more worried about their careers and special interests than they are about what is good for this country.

So instead of making some tough choices now.  We are going to wait until the world drops the US Dollar as the Worlds Reserve Currency.  When they realize that the US Dollar is going to tank, someone is going to start selling a lot of T-Bonds.  It will be like a run on a bank.  Once it starts it will spread like wildfire.

However, I don't think this is just a thing about democratic vs. republican parties.  The animosity that emerged in the republican party over the past two election cycles was in reaction to the George W Bush administration.  A share of the republican party rejected Bush and instead turned to Ron Paul.  This rift hurt Romney in 2012, especially because Paul's platform was rejected by the republicans on many major issues.  Unless there emerges a segment of the democratic party that proves deeply dissatisfied, I don't see liberals turning on each other just because new candidates enter the race.  Obama has not caused that same intra-party dissatisfaction that Bush caused.  My only concern about adding more liberals to the mix is the effect it might have on Clinton's campaign.  Assuming she is the nominee, I think she benefits most from having as centrist a platform as possible.  The more Clinton moves left, the more traction the republicans will gain against her since she will lose independent votes.",2,0.219049873737,0.258783183655,0.439425505051,0.275433422284,1.05,0.75,229,0.0544217687075,17.6153846154,0.0,0.125

&gt;President Barack Obama stated that the decision ""gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washingtonwhile undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates"".[58] Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, ""this ruling strikes at our democracy itself"" and ""I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest"".[59] On January 27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, ""Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law[60] to open the floodgates for special interestsincluding foreign corporationsto spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."" On television, the camera shifted to a shot of the SCOTUS judges in the front row directly in front of the President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his head side to side while mouthing the words ""Not true"".[61][62][63][64][65][66]

&gt;Democratic senator Russ Feingold, a lead sponsor of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, stated ""This decision was a terrible mistake. Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president.""[67] Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat, stated that it was ""the worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case, and that the court had opened the door to political bribery and corruption in elections to come.[68] Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards, along with constitutional law professor and Maryland Democratic State Senator Jamie Raskin, have advocated petitions to reverse the decision by means of constitutional amendment.[69] Rep. Leonard Boswell introduced legislation to amend the constitution.[70] Senator John Kerry also called for an Amendment to overrule the decision.[71] On December 8, 2011, Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the Saving American Democracy Amendment, which would reverse the court's ruling.

The Supremes got it wrong.  Some of them (Alito) obviously never understood what it was about: power and disenfranchisement.

Naturally someone who supports the pink satin pants would try to claim that opponents ""support a rewrite of the first amendment.""


&gt; The Supreme Court reversed this decision, striking down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from making independent expenditures and ""electioneering communications"".

&gt; The United States Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by a nonprofit corporation. The principles articulated by the Supreme Court in the case have also been extended to for-profit corporations, labor unions and other associations.

Almost every major Republican/Democrat pretty much share the same foreign policy/ major domestic programs. And that never changes. What we need more than ever, is a president that puts an end to this madness. That finally puts a stop to the foreign policy we've had for 40 + years.

I'm tired of people voting for people in their party because they ""aren't crazy""..and then those same stooges end up letting you down, and pulling the same shit their past admins do.

I truly believe a lot of our problems stem from our foreign policy. And a lot of major domestic programs like the NSA spying, will have HUGE ramifications later down the line. I really truly believe, it's time to vote someone in like Rand who will finally make major substantial changes. Changes that Obama promised and didn't deliver on. And while I get congress has impeded most of what he wanted, there is no excuse for how Obama has continued Bush Era foreign policy/ domestic programs like spying. Obama fell in like like a little bitch, and just continued.

That sounds painful 

&gt; There's ample evidence of voter suppression in 2010, 2012, and especially 2014, especially of minorities, in rural and sub-urban areas all over the country.  

And if those actions were illegal, then those responsible should be prosecuted 

I hope you aren't talking about voter Ids. 

&gt; There's serious questions about the Ohio 2004 presidential vote and the 2000 Florida presidential vote that nobody wants to address as well.

I'm sure those questions have been addressed many times 

&gt; I noticed you also left off the rest of what I said there, lemme just point that out, ""where people make informed choices based on the candidates records and facts about their platforms"".

Why is that a requirement for voting? If I want to vote for the politician that has the best hair or the best body or which one I think can eat a hot dog the fastest that's my right. There's no requirement that my decision be informed on the candidates records or platforms. 

&gt; Did you leave out that part of the quote because you disagree that people who are voting should make informed choices based on facts?

I agree that they should: I hope they do, but if they don't or don't want to, I support their right to do that as well

&gt;Nothing is stopping individuals from researching their candidates platforms.
&gt;
&gt; So because the truth is out there for your average citizen, like a low-rent Fox Mulder, to find, it's ok to simply lie about candidates in the national media, over public airwaves?

I have no idea what a low rent fox milder is. Yes: lying is still speech.

If I want broadcast on my YouTube channel and say: Obama is socialist, 24/7 that's my right. If me and my buddies wana host a radio talk show where all we do is fantasize about how great Bernie sanders will be and how he will guide us to mars that is our right to express our speech in that context
 
Unless you believe the government should have the power to control our context of speech and control what is allowed to be said and not. Essentially giving government the power to dictate speech 

&gt;Speech
&gt;
&gt; Money is not speech.

Correct, but money spent in the promotion or due exercise of an action such as speech is protected and punished as that action 

Buckley v Valeo is a great court case on this issue 

&gt;So you want the government to limit how many candidates can run for government
&gt;
&gt; No, I want Public Financing of Elections.  Actually what I really want is to separate politicians from money interests.  I want the people elected to examine policy scientifically and to try to best represent the views of the entire area they represent, instead of the narrow interests represented by their highest donors.

No you said you wanted candidates from 4 to 5 parties. If there is public financing of elections: what if 100,000 people decide to run for office?

Let's focus on something you said

* I want the people elected to examine policy scientifically and to try to best represent the views of the entire area they represent, 

What if the constituents of the area a congress person represents do not want him to examine it scientifically. Let's say they don't believe in evolution of global warning?

Then what?

&gt;Money spent in the promotion of speech is protected as that speech.
&gt;
&gt; Bullshit.  Money has nothing to do with speech.  

Saying bullshit: isn't an argument. As noted above, there's a good court case on this issu

Buckley v Valeo

&gt; It's completely separate.  It is not related at all.  

Actually it's greatly related. Me spending $10 to buy a shirt and ink to write a message on my shirt is me spending money to promote my speech

Me buying markers and protest signs is me spending money to promote and exercise my speech

Me buying ad time is me spending money to promote and exercise my speech

&gt; There's all sorts of things the government doesn't allow you to spend money on.  What you do with money is you buy things.  

And what did I state before that you cut out:

Money spent in the promotion or due exercise of an action is protected and punished as that action. Money spent on things illegal (cocaine) is also illegal.

Thanks for supporting my point that:

* There's all sorts of things the government doesn't allow you to spend money on. 



&gt; Your ability to buy space on media platforms is not a protected right.  The TV news can decline to publish your ""speech"", as has been done in the past.  


Correct and I support that right as well

&gt; The Green Party and other 3rd parties in the United States have trouble getting ads on television in big markets during political seasons, because the networks tend to reject 3rd party ads.  It's done all the time.  


Mainly because they can't afford them 

&gt; I support the freedom of people to express their speech.  That's what free speech is all about.  It must be protected
&gt;
&gt; You choose to reject any limitation on the expenditure of money in the furtherance of speech.

No: I choose to support the judicial principle of 

* Money spent in the promotion or due exercise of an action is protected and punished as that action.

To limit the spending of money on speech, government must first limit the speech. To do this, government must pass the strict scrutiny test 

For example: broadcasting treasonous speech that for example tells of location of our soldiers in combat is illegal and thus the government has passed the strict scrutiny test

&gt; understand your position already.  But that didn't answer my question, which was how you justify that view.  

Because to me: the opposite is worse

Giving or allowing government the power to control what Individuals can say or spend money on to say when it's simply political is opening the door for tyranny 

If 20 years from now you feel as if president John Doe is about to become a dictator. I want to support your right to spend money or get donations and broadcast your message.

I don't want to give government the power to say:

""This is political speech: you can't say that""

&gt; This Tsunami of money has had an effect, and that effect has been to silence anyone who isn't able to raise that kind of money.  Not through censorship, but simply by burying them, like proverbial needles in haystacks.

Its impossible to bury someone. You are speaking right now: you are not buried any candidate can do an AMA or go on cnn or launch a blog

Remember: the right to be heard doesn't exist 

&gt; find it strange that you object so strenuously to any limitation on money being spent to further speech, but give no care to the obvious silencing of people who cannot muster such resources.

Because they aren't being silenced. They can talk all they want. No one is stopping them

&gt; And since that money can now be provided by much smaller groups of individuals, this kind of silencing is only increasing, the money not only silences people who are opposed, it silences people who support the candidate, because the candidate doesn't have to worry as much about them, he can address his concerns to the needs of his highest donors.

Interestingly, the email is targeted at Obama, not Mitch McConnell.

Pauls campaign writes:

The showdown over illegal NSA spying is today.

President Obama has declared I expect them to take action and take action swiftly.

But Rand is standing up to President Obamas demands by forcing illegal NSA spying to expire.

He wont allow Congress to rush a bill through the Senate that extends the NSAs bulk data collection program.

And the attacks are sure to escalate now that Rand stood up to President Obama.

So hes counting on you to be in his corner as this fight continues.
