&gt; Tesla has finally taken the wraps off Tesla Energy, its ambitious battery system that can work for homes, businesses, and even utilities.

&gt; The system breaks down into two separate products: the Powerwall is a home battery system, that comes in a 10 kWh version for $3,500, or a 7 kWh model for $3,000.

&gt; The system is connected to the internet - Elon Musk said that the system can be used to create &amp;quot;Smart microgrids&amp;quot; - and can be used as a redundancy system, or potentially allow a home to go off the power grid entirely.

&gt; Musk said Tesla is capable of &amp;quot;Infinitely scaling&amp;quot; the units into a gigawatt hour-class installation, which could power a mid-sized town of about 100,000 people, or even build larger configurations.

&gt; The company&amp;#039;s consumer- and business-focused batteries will eventually be manufactured at the massive Gigafactory that Tesla is building in Nevada, where Tesla car batteries will also be made.

&gt; Grandiose ambitions have always been part of the Tesla pitch, and there is the chance that Musk&amp;#039;s bets could pay off.

Electric cars use deep cycling, IE they pull the batteries down to 50% or lower discharge state.  A lead acid deep cycle battery can do this without dying, but it only lasts a couple hundred cycles.  A regular car battery even less time.

A regular car battery or deep cycle kept charged 90% of the time lasts much, much longer... thousands of charge cycles or more, as long as when it's discharged partly it's immediately recharged.

L-I batteries handle deep discharge like any other discharge, so they last about 400 cycles either way.  Tesla is doing their own batteries, so probably unique chemistry for longer life.  

In summary: For electric cars, L-I is great.  For car starter batteries or short term grid boosting, lead acid lasts much longer.

Solar Panels produce DC electricity.  The micro inverters on each panel convert this DC current to AC, since that is what the grid is set up to run.  In order to integrate a battery in your system, you'd have to convert that (DC-converted) AC back to DC, into your battery, then back to AC again if you wanted to use it.  Each time you do that, you're taking an efficiency hit, not to mention requiring a lot more expensive equipment.

Tesla doesn't say whether or not the powerwall has an integral charge controller, but one will be required to regulate the DC current from the solar array into the battery.

Also, solar panels have really come down in price, so you should be able to get some decent wattage out of your systems without paying a lot upfront. Look into any rebates that local and federal offers for installing solar / regulations etc.

This is what I know: Diesel Generators are usually very loud, and good for emergency situations only. You can get Diesels that are quieter, but they also cost more. Gasoline Generators are in general quieter, esp the better engines Hyundai, Honda, Contractor Grade, etc

*****
&gt; A medium-sized commercial weed grow with around 50 lights stands to save about $US13,500 in electricity costs a year with the use of two Tesla Batteries.

&gt; &amp;quot;Where these batteries might start to make sense for small growers is when LEDs are optimised for herb,&amp;quot; says our grower.

&gt; Given the current pace of marijuana legalisation, the need for clandestine home grows may largely be eliminated by the time dipping energy consumption and increasing battery capacity meet in a home solar power sweet zone, but as a massive electricity consumer, it does look like the marijuana industry is going to profit from the same Tesla Battery benefits everyone else will - reduced peak demand and increased stability during outages.

62,"Tesla home-battery thing. Personally I think it's just a battery with a Falcon-9 full of marketing hype strapped to it, and it's overrated.

There are very few electricity markets around the world that pass along real-time spikes in electricity price to the customer - so the concept of being able to buy electricity when it's cheap and sell it when it's high, or export microgeneration power onto the grid when it's expensive when demand peaks, just doesn't really exist.


And even if such a thing was rolled out, the Tesla battery and the inverter would have to be able to get that information in real-time, and they would have to be able to communicate and interconnect into smart meters - the infrastructure just doesn't exist yet.

Batteries are already routinely used with remote off-grid solar photovoltaic installations where reliable around-the-clock access to a limited amount of electricity is needed. You can already buy batteries, they're nothing new. But we don't currently put batteries in every grid-connected home already because there is no environmental or economic case for doing so, and Tesla hasn't changed this. People can, and would, have large lead-acid banks in their homes now if there was any good motivation to do so.

A stack of ordinary good quality deep-cycle batteries designed for off-grid PV battery banks, which you can buy off the shelf right now, will cost about AUD $3300 for 10 kWh, excluding the inverter etc. Compare that to Tesla's offering - about AUD $4458 (USD$3500) for the same amount of energy storage. That's strange, I thought the Tesla offering was supposed to be cheaper than the existing products on the market (which nobody uses in this context because there is no reason to and not remotely any economical case for doing so.)

And if you buy an ordinary battery it's just a battery - you can use it with any inverter, PV charge controller etc. You don't have any proprietary lock-in to only using certain inverter brands that Tesla chooses to support. This looks like it could be a problem. The pricing for the Tesla system does not include an inverter, but some people say, well, that's OK, because I've already got a solar PV system with a grid-connected inverter, and I can just connect in the battery to the existing system. But what if you can't? What's the true cost, when you add the rest of the system, including an appropriate grid-connected inverter supported by Tesla, and installation?

As anybody uncool enough to have used the same cellphone or laptop for many years without replacing it will tell you, lithium batteries will eventually die and need to be replaced. Will Tesla start offering battery-as-a-service in order to overcome this? What will it cost? Will we start seeing people reverse-engineering the proprietary ID firmware, as with toner cartridges, to get around the brand lock-in?

Go read up on the engineering differences between the 2 cars.

I will share the details on why the BMW battery pack is far superior to the Tesla:

Tesla still uses a 18650, a 2.9 or rather 3.4 Ah cell more recently.  That is the round cell everyone knows from electrical devices in the home.  With a nickel-cobalt-alminum cathode and graphite on the anode and mixed with a bit of silicon.  The battery life is not very long in this case.

65,"Your numbers don't make any sense at all. 

First, let's forget about the 10kWh unit for now. As noted [here](http://www.teslamotors.com/presskit/teslaenergy?via=newsletter&amp;source=CSAMedition), the 10kWh unit is for backup applications with weekly cycling. The 7kWh is designed for the daily use we're talking about. 

So, it's $3,000 for the 7kWh unit.  We have a ten year warranty. 10 * 365.25 * 7=25567.5 kWh. That's 11.7 cents per kWh just for the battery.

But wait, how much juice can we get out of that unit every day? 7kWh? No way, unless we repeal the laws of physics.  Tesla states the battery has 92% round trip efficiency. 92% of 7 is 6.44. Then we have to factor in the losses in the inverter. A typical inverter is about 95% efficient. We now have 6.12 kWh or 22346 kWh. 13.4 cents per kWh.

Can we use all that 6.12 kWh every day? Probably not. Cycling a battery down to 0% charge every day is going to kill it way before its time, unless Musk has invented some kind of super new battery. Let's be generous and say we can use 90% of the power every day without damaging the battery. 5.5 kWh per day or 20111 kWh over the battery life. 14.9 cents per kWh.

That's nearly fifteen cents a kWh just for the battery.  That's roughly what grid power costs in a lot of places.  And remember we're not even calculating the cost of the inverter or installation, which is going to be several thousand dollars on top of that.  Plus, I haven't even attempted to calculate the loss of charge capacity over time, which is significant.

Most likely $35,000 is cost after credits so its a $45,000+ Tesla, with less range/amenities than even a cheap ICE car. Musk thought he could magically drive down li-ion battery costs. He can't, even with his own factory he's largely going to be at the same pricing according to most analysts. li-ion production is already ultra-competitive.

The real question is what li-ion alternatives do we have and which are feasible in the upcoming future. I believe EV's are our future, but ones powered by li-ion won't be, or at least, won't dethrone ICE cars.

Recharging zinc-air batteries is possible in the lab, it might be able to scale to EV applications. 3x the density of li-ion and lighter and easier on the environment and made with cheap zinc is very, very impressive.

Tesla reminds me of those ""portable computers"" from the 80s that were 15-20lbs monsters you carried around with those tiny tiny screens.  The tech for a proper laptop wasnt there yet. LCD screens weren't at that level, micro technology wasn't, batteries weren't, etc.  Then it all came together much later. We're still in the ""we dont actually have the tech to do this right"" stage with Tesla and it shows.

edit: herp derp fanboy downvotes ahoy! For those of you who are 100% certain about the cost of this thing, just remember what the Model S was estimated it a few years before it came out. Its MUCH more expensive than Elon thought he could do.  Don't parrot PR to me and pretend you know everything. This car literally does not exist yet. All we have are half-truths, promises, and questionable economics. Skepticism is warranted, if not demanded. Especially with these dismal financials:

&gt; Tesla made its existing range of electric cars a little more affordable this week by introducing the option of buying a used Model S. Even so, you&amp;#039;re still going to be paying upwards of $60,000 for one.

&gt; What Tesla needs to go mainstream is a significantly cheaper car, and that car is the Model 3.

&gt; The Model 3 is expected to have a range of 200 miles and be 20% smaller than the Model S. That range doesn&amp;#039;t sound great, but is more than enough for most daily commutes, and when you factor in the predicted price tag of $35,000, you can see how this could quickly become Tesla&amp;#039;s best-selling car.

Edit: Isn't this a roadblock to the future clean energy earth we want. If we have batteries for cars, homes, businesses, everything. Doesn't that point to a future where we could possibly run out of battery material?

Let me ignorantly propose a solution that to me seems more in tune with the future that we want:

1. The earth is always supplied with  a non-interrupted source of energy in the sun. 

2. The only problem is the day/night cycle, where we are plunged into darkness for half the day, or else the weather, which can interrupt energy flow. 

3. I propose Bit energy, a worldwide internet of energy. An initiative where the excess power is syphoned of those who are in the daylight and with good weather, and is distributed to those in night time/ bad weather. 

I am no electrical engineer, but I am guessing this will remove the high dependency on batteries that will come  from the current model Tesla is promoting.  Not to knock Tesla, but I just don't understand why we need to store the energy if there is a way that we can minimise it . 

To my ignorant self, the only roadblock is political, but I can see this as a way of promoting inter dependability between nation states, and I don't see it as a mammoth task either. The electrical distribution systems in every country just need to connect to a neighbouring country e.g. U.K. builds a line to France, Holland, and perhaps across to America. China builds to Japan, Pakistan, India. In this way the whole globe is connected. 

Every country needs its solar farms. Perhaps even each household can have their own solar panels and feed the electricity in to the network. 


Again, I'm no expert, but just from viewing the earth as one system, that has an uninterrupted supply of power, always, we should be thinking of the most elegant and least waste producing solution.

For you, a high stock price means, ""Apple stock is expensive... rich fucks."" 

For the firm, a high stock price means, ""Hey, our cost of equity capital is low, we can fund lots of cool projects with that.""

Why does having a low Equity Cost of Capital (ECC) matter?

Take Tesla, healthy stock price, no operating profit. Now, if you were a bank, and Tesla asked you for a loan, what would you do? You'd want to secure it against physical assets, property, equipment, etc., anything that guaranteed you'd be repaid in default. But after Tesla maxes out their ability to take on debt, what can they do?

Imagine you're an investor, Tesla asks you for money. Tesla isn't offering any collateral, it's all spoken for (by banks). However, if you put in now, you get a share of the profits later. Oh ho ho! Do you think your investment could pan out? Do you think electric cars are really cool, and will be a growth market in the next few years? Hell yeah, you want to be in on the ground floor, right?

So you buy, and you encourage all your friends to buy. Tesla shares go up. ECC goes down. That means when Tesla wants to finance risky projects by creating and selling common stock, your shares won't get diluted as much. 

Don't believe me? Take a look at this:

Under 'Financial Statements', click on 'Consolidated Statement of Operations'. If you haven't seen one of these before, it might seem a little non-intuitive to read. So I'll walk you through it. The three lines to note are 'Gross Profit', 'Research and Development', and 'Net Loss'. It boils down to this:

Tesla made profit selling cars, about $880 million.

Tesla spent $464 million of R&amp;D.

All together, Tesla lost $294 million.

Now imagine, what if Tesla couldn't raise equity anymore? Tesla now urgently needs to make a net profit, in order to avoid defaults with creditors, stay solvent, etc. What would they likely do? Cut R&amp;D, then lean on the expenses in SG&amp;A and labor. Tesla would then show a profit, be able to cover interest payments, and become a somewhat stable firm. However, with no R&amp;D funding, there would be no more advances in battery technology, or electric car design from Tesla. The potential to revolutionize the automotive industry would be choked off. And that's why a high price for TSLA drives the development of electric cars. 

TLDR: High stock price -&gt; low cost to firm for financing risky projects -&gt; more R&amp;D happens
Low stock price -&gt; risky projects become expensive to finance -&gt; firm underinvests in things like R&amp;D

Sure. But look at the warranty business around the world. 99% of electronics warrenties make special considerations for power-packs. The Tesla cars themselves have specific breakdowns for warranties as swell. 

In addition, they only offered an 8 year warranty on Tesla cars, which happens to exactly line up with 1000 discharge cycles.

There are cheaper, heavier battery chemistries-- but they also generally have non-homeowner-friendly downsides.  Lead-acid will get the job done cheap, but your average homeowner is probably going to brick them all via missed or incorrect maintenance.  Lead-acid batteries can be totally ruined in just a couple of weeks of incorrect upkeep.

Lithium ion has a large advantage in performance in high-discharge applications-- things like running your air conditioner or heat pump, for example.  A lead-acid battery gets less and less efficient the faster it is discharged.  Nameplate capacity is usually quoted as if the battery is discharged over a period of 20 hours.  Even just discharging it overnight, in ten hours, loses 15% of the capacity.  Discharging it one hour means you lose half of your capacity.  Lead acid is still cheap enough that you can simply buy twice as much battery to overcome this... but the difference is not as stark as nameplate capacity would suggest in real-world applications.  You can dump the entire capacity of a Li-ion battery in 30 minutes, and it suffers only a minor drop in efficiency.  For a real-world comparison, use a rule of thumb that you need twice as much capacity if you use lead-acid as you do lithium ion.  It's still cheaper, but not by nearly as much as it seems.

And finally, Tesla needs the economy of mass production for battery applications that *are* weight-sensitive.  They make electric cars.

I'd like to hear the other side of the argument and decide for myself. But first i have to hear the other side.

**Edit:** [Found it](http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/293/Forehand.pdf).

Three companies controlled 95% of the automobile market in the country. They had tremendous power:

&gt; Dealers are with few exceptions completely dependent on the manufacturer for their supply of cars. When the dealer has invested to the extent required to secure a franchise, he becomes in a real sense the economic captive of his manufacturer. The substantial investment of his own personal funds by the dealer in the business, the inability to convert easily the facilities to other uses, the dependence upon a single manufacturer for supply of automobiles, and the difficulty of obtaining a franchise from another manufacturer all contribute toward making the dealer an easy prey for domination by the factory. 
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, from the standpoint of the automobile manufacturer, any single dealer is expendable. The faults of the factory-dealer system are directly attributable to the superior market position of the manufacturer

In 1956, [public opinion wanted to limit the power of the big 3](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1222):

&gt; Any manufacturer can be sued by their dealership if the manufacturer fails *to act in good faith in performing or complying with any of the terms or provisions of the franchise, or in terminating, canceling, or not renewing the franchise with said dealer*.

The question becomes: 

*Do i care if a car company threatens to, or actually does, drive a dealership out of business? Do I care if a manufacturer has that much power over the economy?*

The answer is: *No, i don't.* 

i don't care if Microsoft decides to forbid PC manufactures from pre-loading another web-browser on the PC. i don't care if Apple forces customers to use iTunes. i don't care if XBox is online-only, and SimCity requires always-on DRM. i don't care if Bell was too big, if IBM was too big, or the Banks are too-big-to-fail.

i certainly don't care if Tesla motors controls 95% of the manufacturing sector in the economy.

So, bring it to a vote: and see how many other people don't care.

So there are definitely drawbacks and it's not possible to just generate everything in one big desert, it's not completely infeasible either to ship energy over long distances as it's a relatively efficient thing to do.

Energy storage (e.g. batteries) are hugely important, but also have big issues. Fact is that storing energy for 24h of usage for one household costs easily $7-10k in tech (battery, inverter etc). And that has an environmental cost, and has a lifetime (e.g. 15 years.) In other words, gigantic investments in batteries have to be made before we could e.g. power winter weeks with excess summer solar energy. I don't really see batteries filling that role. And storage compensation as for short-term variations in output (e.g. within a single day or afternoon), they're mostly smoothed over at scale and not that hard to predict (good models exist), so low capacity nuclear can support a lot of solar capacity. And even if you don't want to go nuclear, it may be more efficient to produce extra solar capacity than extra battery capacity. And already we've heard that you can't use e.g. the new Tesla battery for arbitrage even with high feeding tariffs (i.e. store energy when you don't use it and the price is low, feed it back into the grid to other people when the price is high) which indicates a limited market need for balancing out energy using energy storage. 

There's definitely a place for batteries and in that place they can be hugely important (e.g. replacing coal plants that act as a backup to solar capacity in China when it's cloudy) but some walk around with the notion we'll have billions of them, one in every home, and many in every business, factory etc and have a giant smart grid.

Indeed this is.

&gt; p.s. if it's true, then yes he's an a-hole.

Well note that even if ""it"" is true it still doesn't follow he's an arsehole. 

From the article
&gt; Musk even scolded a Tesla employee for missing an event to witness the birth of his child, Vances book says.

&gt; Heres the email Musk reportedly sent to a Tesla employee that wasnt identified by name in the book:

&gt;&gt; That is no excuse. I am extremely disappointed. You need to figure out where your priorities are. Were changing the world and changing history, and you either commit or you dont. 

First of all note in the second paragraph the wording is such that the  ""a Tesla employee"" doesn't necessarily refer to the same ""a Tesla employee"" in the first paragraph. That is, as written, the email beginning ""That is no excuse"" could be referencing an excuse that has nothing to do with children.

In that case
&gt; Musk even scolded a Tesla employee for missing an event to witness the birth of his child, Vances book says.

.... could be true in that Musk could have scolded a Tesla employee *before* realizing that the employee was in position of a reasonable excuse (that would be still bad form, but not as bad a form).

On 
&gt; When an employee complained in Teslas early days that they were working too much, Musk said he would tell those people they will get to see their families a lot when we go bankrupt, 

... there is a whole context that's missing. We know that in the early days Tesla was facing bankruptcy. So Musk's comment could well have been a relay of the cold hard facts, in the middle of a larger expression not quoted here.

For example Musk could have been conveying, for all we know, something like
&gt; We are facing bankruptcy and given the limited funds in the bank we all need to put in extraordinary hours to make this work. If we can achieve such and such and outcome I'm going to be in a position to get more funding .... then we can take a break and resume normal hours.

The insidious thing about uncorroborated gossip is the false innuendo even on the basis of true claims.

Elon does some neat stuff, has some neat ideas, but in 5 years both these companies may not exist. They can't make money, they have no real roadmap to making money, and they're all huge risks that have not paid off. He hasn't changed anything.. at least not yet.

Personally, I think he should quit everything and solely focus at making SpaceX profitable by courting foreign governments and getting off the taxpayer's teat.  I think its time.  Tesla can be acquired by someone else, maybe GM, to salvage the brand for their own EV initiatives.

And yes Elon is an eccentric weirdo who loses his temper and had a HUGE PR department taking care of his ""inventor philosopher genius"" image that is 100% manufactured.

And when you go up in price, BMW and Mercedes sell high performance EV sportscars that blow anything Tesla offers out of the water on any metric.

* Batteries: Tesla has pretty good battery management and charging technology, they are ahead of the competition by a couple of years. But in terms of underlying battery technology they aren't special, they use common technology. Battery systems for homes have existed for years, Tesla's offering is just a little simpler to use and looks nicer.

&gt; The chart below compares the estimated value of Tesla battery reservations-these are not ironclad commitments to buy-with the early sales of three breakthrough products: the original iPhone, released in 2007; Viagra&amp;#039;s debut in 1998; and the introduction of the Tesla Model S battery-powered car in 2012.

&gt; Tesla is going to need that battery revenue as soon as it can get it: The company is burning through cash to invest in the Model X electric SUV due later this year, the more affordable Model 3 slated to arrive 2017, and a $5 billion battery factory to power it all.

The people who believe this 1. probably have never bought a new car and/or 2. have no idea the actual size of the automotive industry. 

What, the Tesla is running for like $80-$130k these days? It's nowhere near affordable, and probably won't be for years to come, and even when it *is* affordable, it's not like everyone is going to magically just forget about the big three, not to mention all of the Hondas, Toyotas, etc., and buy a Tesla.

I never mentioned anything about saving money.

&gt; Honda still needs salesmen to show you the car, teach you everything about it, and to most of all sell you a car. Those salesmen will still be paid a commission. 

Why would they NEED this? All you need is a small showroom. Tesla sets up showrooms in malls with a bunch of sales people who answer questions and take orders.

&gt; Honda needs a service department to service warranty issues, install accessories and perform maintenance.

Why does a service department need to be attached to a dealership?

&gt; Honda Needs a location to show all their cars, trim levels, and colors, and be able to deliver the car same day

Again, why would they NEED this? All they need is a showroom and a few computers to show off extra colors/options. You don't need a parking lot capable of holding 1000 cars.

&gt; Honda needs a finance department to give loan approvals, and will likely push their American Honda Finance instead of having 12 banks compete to give you the lowest interest rate.

Yeah, so no more ""back room financing."" I would love this. Either get Honda financing, or bring your own. This is how it should be.

&gt; Honda needs an accounting department to handle all these transactions, and get the paper to all the locations in the government and banks and more. You have no idea what goes in in that department. It is serious business back there.

Sounds like something that could be centralized pretty easily.

&gt; Honda needs to pay all of those people as well. Those people will also need to be paid a commission either % or flat rate to get those people to work harder and provide incentives to work harder and sell more cars.

So... Honda needs employees? OK

&gt; Basically, Honda still needs the exact same things a regular dealer needs. Only Honda doesn't have to compete with itself any more. No matter where you go, that Civic is the same price, and because of that, they can sell their Civics for more, instead of less.

If they sell for more, then Hyundai will eat their lunch by selling cheaper. That's competition. 

&gt; If you are buying your xbox from best buy, you are paying to much. You are not a smart consumer.

Microsoft sets the price of an Xbox. Yes, there are sales, but typically, you are paying the same price no matter where you go. The irony here is that the best place to buy is online, where there's potential to avoid some sales tax.

&gt; I am someone who was in the industry, and know what it takes for things to work. I love Honda as a company, they are amazing, but it would not be any cheaper for if Honda sold us a car directly.

Everything *can* be illegal if the legislatures write and pass laws banning them. I assume you meant to ask ""why"" or ""what's the justification for this?""

MANY states prohibit direct sales of automobiles and require independently owned dealership. These laws date back 50+ years and are there to protect dealership investments. There was concern that Ford, GMC, et al built up dealership networks rather than investing in their own distribution model, but at any moment the manufacturers could open their own stores and compete with the dealers or even refuse to sell new cars to dealers. In some states, direct sales are possible only if you don't already have dealership contracts, in other states they're prohibited entirely.

This change wont happen until individuals realize that they are the problem and not governments.

Technology can solve the problem of literacy, it already is in third world countries with affordable electronics. What is more efficient, build a school and bus in kids from all over town or allow children to learn from home through technology?

Private security and police are far more efficient because they will actually prevent crime. Unlike state police forces who spend most of their time violently seeking revenue for the state because thats their only business model. You pay for car insurance right? Why not pay for private police? Or better yet you can personally protect yourself and your neighbors. Most people in this world are not blood thirsty criminals, if adults were comfortable with defending themselves criminals would be vastly outnumbered.

They wouldn't sell parts to anyone except company-owned dealers and would purposefully not compete with rival manufacturers, dividing the country into regions where a customer could only choose from a handful (or a single) of manufacturers. 

So the states banned direct sales and said ""you have to go through a middleman"" which meant that a city could have both Chrysler AND Ford dealerships, and multiple dealerships could compete on the basis of price for automobiles and repair parts. 

As a side effect, with so many independent dealers an entirely new market of regional parts dealers and brokers was created to service the thousands of dealerships, a task that big automakers didn't want to take on, and that led to the sale of parts to specialized retailers like Autozone and NAPA. 

Now there are many more manufacturers (on the surface) with European and Asian imports and the emerging electric car manufacturers. 

But if a new manufacturer (or completely new model of auto ownership) leads to the extinction of the major automakers what do you think the chances of anti-consumer practices emerging again are?

257,"I don't understand people's gripes with dealerships. If you want an easy car buying experience, just tell them you'll pay msrp out the door and they'll be happy to comply. The difference between Tesla and the auto dealerships is that you have the ability to haggle the retail price down, sometimes beyond invoice. 

Imagine now that Tesla is able to sell cars directly, other manufacturers will follow. But, instead of pricing their cars at invoice price to the customers, they turn their msrp into just manufacture retail price. So, in the end, you won't be able to haggle on that ridiculous markup. 

How do I know car manufacturers will do that? Because they want to make as much money as they can. If instead of only making 40% profit over cost of production,  they can make 80% by cutting out the middleman and sell directly to consumers without giving consumers the ability to haggle price,  they'll do it. 

Tesla is trying to gain market in car sales,  so they're being philosophical and pricing their cars reasonably well.

1. The state doesnt want to allow it because of dealer fees and taxes, and no Taxes wont be the same with direct sales.  There are many fees, taxes, fines associated with dealer's that will never be the case with direct sales, such as when a car is older than 60 days, a dealer has a to start paying taxes on that car. Imagine having 30+ new cars over 60 days old on a lot.  That's a lot of revenue for the state. 

2.  Jobs.  Dealers employ hundreds of people, if not thousands for the bigger ones.   Mechanics, accounts, sales, BDC, detail, ect.  Not only that, but those dealers also employ outside contractors for work as well.  

3.  Competition.  If you bought directly from the manufacturer, you know that MSRP sticker price you want to haggle down?  Forget about that.  You will pay full sticker and then some.  Ever get a discount from apple?  If anything you pay over sticker.  The same would happen with car sales if it went to direct sales.  There would be no 3 GM dealers in your area to haggle with until you get the price you want.  

4. Repairs.  Ever had an apple product go bad?  How much time do you have to wait to get it fixed?  Car dealer's have certified master techs ON SITE.  Will manufacturers with direct sales have the same?  Hell no.  You would have to send your car back on a tow truck, wait weeks if not months for the repair.  There is no loaner vehicle either.  Dealer's have to actually BUY loaner vehicles from the manufacturer, its not a thing they just hand the dealer's as a courtesy.  So imagine your apple watch breaking, but having no apple store to take it back to.  Now think about that except replace the watch with a car.  Enjoy that misery.

Price breaks and rebates work the same way.. the manufacturer and the dealer still make money on the cars, but they make a little less so they can move more inventory.

The first is price. If I buy from Ford, I pay whatever Ford dictates. The whole negotiating thing? Gone. In the current system, I can actually have several different Ford dealers compete with each other to give me the lowest price on the car. Don't think for one second that if we got rid of the dealers that Ford would be benevolent and drop all the prices of their vehicles for the good of the common man. The exact opposite would most likely happen.

The second reason, and really the biggest one, is service. Dealerships make their money on service, not on sales. Ford does not have the means, nor the methods, to service all of the vehicles they sell. Tesla can afford to send out a guy locally to fix someone's car because it's a small volume luxury brand. McClaren, Ferrari, Lamborghini, they all do this too. But your volume brands? Hell, even your upscale volume brands, like Mercedes and Audi? No, they can't do this kind of thing. Look at this way, in 2014 alone, Toyota sold *418000* Camrys. There is no way Toyota has the means to service all of those cars. And that's just one car. Tesla sells a fraction of that.

292,"&gt; The dealers aren't actually his competitors - the other OEMs are.

That is completely misunderstanding the situation. The OEMs are not against Tesla selling direct -- they would love to have the same option but are legally prohibited from doing so by laws in almost every state.

Sure, a dealer might not initially come across as opposed to Tesla -- until it became clear they weren't going to become the local dealer **for** Tesla. At that moment, Tesla becomes a competitor. Further, Tesla's business model is an existential threat to the entire dealer system. 

&gt; Dealerships are great for the local economy. Which is why various places have passed legislation to protect them. 

Again, you're misattributing cause. The laws don't exist because dealers are great for local economies. The laws exist because dealers are always one of the biggest donor groups to state politicians. 

If the only reasoning was ""business X is good for jobs"" then all states would mandate that self service at gas stations was illegal, like Oregon and New Jersey. We'd make travel web sites illegal because they decimated the travel agent industry. We'd make Craigslist illegal because it destroyed the newspaper industry.

The older auto-companies have been fine with the status quo so far, it's Tesla that's rocking the boat.

Tesla has made no such contractual relationships with any dealerships.  And as such has been fighting in the courts to argue that whatever legislation on the books exists, it doesn't apply to them.

What the Dealer's are saying is that there needs to be Tesla dealer's that follow the same rules, regulations and guidelines other's do.  Which basically means pay a lot of taxes.  

Its nothing more than, ""If he doesnt have to pay that, why do I?""

States of course want money, so if the push is big enough Tesla will not be allowed direct auto sales in the majority of states.  There will be exceptions, but those too will fall over time to hefty lawsuits from dealer's and lobbyist themselves.  

At the end of the day its all about taxes, who has to pay them and who doesnt.  

Also if something on your tesla goes wrong, like the battery for example, you as a consumer are going to wish Tesla had dealers almost immediately when you find out the process its going to take to get it fixed.  Your local average car mechanic is NO WHERE NEAR AND NEVER WILL BE certified to work on a Tesla, let alone your standard hybrid vehicle.  1 wrong move and you will electrocute yourself and everyone else with in a 10 foot radius.  They are very dangerous if you do not know what you are doing.  Tesla is a special product in itself.  Who will fix it?  How will it get fixed?  What will you drive while it gets fixed and who will pay for the rental?  

Tesla's warranty if you look at it lasts just as long as the batteries life.  Which means as soon as that warranty runs out your battery will pretty much need to be replaced.  Which means you have to pay the 10000+ dollars for a new battery yourself.  

Again direct sales mean you have to go back to the manufacturer for all this stuff, and they will not work as hard as a Dealership would because the manufacturer pays the dealership to do all this stuff.  With no dealer involved the manufacturer gets to cut these costs which means very poor customer service after the sale.

Sure, Teslas are expensive now, but laws don't usually go into effect for a year or two and then disappear. Whether Tesla or some other future company, the situation may be different 5 or 10 years from now. And if Tesla (or someone else using a similar business model) were to offer a $20,000 car someday, it will be hard to make this case. Many people *need* a car, and don't have time to travel out of state (especially when the state is as big as Texas) just for the sake of a test drive. For such people, the many equivalently-priced options will just be more convenient, which is precisely what traditional car dealerships are hoping for.

But even for the current market: if you can afford a $70,000 car, you very well might be the kind of busy person who also doesn't have the time (which may be why you can afford such a car). Your argument seems to be: only people who are really committed to Tesla deserve to have one...while other $70,000 cars are a different case. I know a guy who gets a new Porsche Cayenne every three years or so, and he usually decides, test drives, and buys in a day. He's a surgeon, works 12 hour days, and spends the weekend with his family, so he's not going to take the time to go out-of-state just to buy a new car, and if Cayennes, for some reason, were no longer available in-state, he'd just get a different car.

If tesla's direct sales model did not vie for the same dollars that the dealerships are going for they wouldn't care because there would be no competition. Clearly that competition does indeed exist on top of the competition with the manufacturers because the dollars that would have gone to dealerships would now go to tesla instead with this new model.

Think of it as Dell vs. hp before Dell started putting their computers in stores. Dell took all the margin the retail outlets gained from the sale of an hp.

So if you want to spin it as the OEMs like Ford, Toyota, and VW against the upstart Tesla, it sounds anti-""small"" business...but if you look at it as Fortune 1000, 30-billion-dollar Tesla against America's 17,500 locally owned, franchised dealerships...it doesn't sound so anti-small business.

Tesla can take people to court yes, but given that you ALWAYS presume good faith, and that Tesla stated they would not take action against those using their patents in good faith, they are the ones that have to prove that the presumption is false and indeed there was bad faith.

He founded the company that merged and eventually decided to call themselves paypal. He also was the largest single shareholder post merger. It's just name semantics to say he wasn't a founder of the company and service that became paypal. 

As being a Tesla co-founder, he clearly was, a court decided as much. He provided all of initial first millions that got Tesla off the ground.

547,"&gt; Let me reinterate the main point, again

Let me iterate my point again. They didn't promise not to remove patents from the list (among other things). What happens if they remove one?

And let me reiterate my other point again, once Tesla says you no longer are allowed, you are in court trying to prove they can't do that. This is an issue. You don't have a license, you have a promise and now you have to go to court to show that they violated it. This is counter your assertion that you're in the clear unless Tesla proves something.

&gt; So someone doesn't sell the exact same product for cheaper on the very same market they operate on (ever heard of China?).

Pro tip: none of this stuff is going to affect what happens in China. They'll laugh at the patents regardless. And if Tesla tries to fight it the Chinese government will first point out knockoffs are legal in China and then push them out of the Chinese market if they don't accept that answer.

And in this case who could blame them? They would point out that other companies are allowed to use Tesla's patents to compete with Tesla, but Chinese companies are being discriminated against for doing something (making knockoffs) which is legal in China.

&gt; Because the holders of a license can stop others that don't hold it from using it so it's either license for everyone 

If you give licenses to everyone this isn't an issue. So why isn't it licenses for everyone? You didn't actually respond to what I said. What is it not a free license for all like MPEG-LA or others do?

&gt; Otherwise, anyone anywhere can use them. Not a novelty concept, and not a hard one to grasp.

again, nobody forces anyone to use Tesla's patents if the deal is so bad. and if tesla was violating everyone else's patents like you imply, those bigger car manufacturers would sue.

I think the only reason people like you might be upset about this is because it destroys a certain business model, like the patent trolls, or or using patents to stifle competition.

You clearly don't understand the simple fact that for Tesla to stop anyone from using their patents, they are the ones that need to take them to court, and you clearly don't undertsand what a presumption is, or how the burden of proof works. Given the express authorization for anyone in good faith (which is presumed and must be disproved by whoever claims it isn't the case - that would be Tesla, who is alwo the accuser in the scenario) to use their patents, bad faith by the defendant needs to be proven by the accuser, who also needs to be the holder of the patent. 

&gt;Pro tip: none of this stuff is going to affect what happens in China. They'll laugh at the patents regardless

Indeed, but they can't sell a copy model S in the western market, but you conveniently ignored that part. No one gives a damn about what China sells in China, it's when they export to whatever marktet the people have a patent on that the problem starts. 

Someone selling a $ 0.10 knockoff of a product that costs $ 0.05 to make and is sold by BRAND for $10.00 may be held liable, but it won't get anywhere because those people rarely have any money worth taking, and the production of cheap, disposable trinkets can be easily and quickly relocated to any of a number of factories. That is not the case with a goddam car plant. To make cars you need A LOT of money, and to make that profitable, your exports need to sell. The moment someone tries to sell a multi-thousand dollar product in the international market, they either play by the rules or no country will let those goods get in their borders, hence why they'd need permission to do so. 

&gt;You didn't actually respond to what I said.

I just did, again. Any judge worth their pay would put an end to the lawsuits of a company that baited others into using their patents with a promisse of not taking legal action, then took legal action against people in good faith. That is textbook bad faith, and it is punished by pretty much any legal system in the planet. The exercise of one's rights cannot cause damage to others acting in good faith, such a scenario is known as the abuse of rights and recognized internationally, though common law likes to remain ignorant of concepts that are 3 thousand years old in their origin and 300 years old in their modern, mature form.

&gt;What happens if they remove one?

IF no one has implemented a production process that's reliant on it, nothing. No harm, no foul. However IF someone has implemented a production process for a product that does rely on it, in good faith (that is presumed and must be disproved by whoever claims otherwise - I'm repeating this a lot, that is because you like to ignore this), AND Tesla does take them to copurt to charge royalties or stop production, they could simply say that when they started, it was on the list, and that they were thus allowed, adding to it that Tesla, with it's sudden and unbidden change is acting in bad faith and causing them damages through patent trolling (again, I am repeating this because in your rush to criticise my naivety are making an argument based on the ignorance of basic guiding principles of law adopted worldwide).",1,0.108901515152,0.0997154415932,0.347673160173,0.213401776386,0.402777777778,0.633333333333,660,0.0217983651226,30.0,-0.0625,0.374900793651

Yeah, you must have missed the parts where it says that there are ongoing lawsuits on those cases.

&gt;Again, Tesla did not promise in that document not to remove patents from the list. So why do you feel there is some restriction on them removing patents from the list?

Have you even read what I wrote? If A makes a statement allowing people to use any of the five houses in a list of proerties they own to establisyh a business/live in so long as it is in good faith, then removes two of the houses from said list, do you think the people in those houses can do nothing? Hell no. They can stay there until A attempts to have them removed, for which A needs a court order, whcih mkeans a judicial process where those harmeed by A attempting to revoke the priviledges they allowed before can defend themselves by arguing that they had a reasonable expectation that they would be allowed to stay, and if they have to stop living/doing business there A is responsible for the costs they incurred, in good faith to get set-up their business because when they set it up, they were allowed to do so, and since there is no indication of them not being allowed in the future, their expectation that Tesla would not revoke that for whatever reason is very much reasonable. 

To sum up: if tesla were to retract some of the patents from the list they'd have to pay whoever was using them the ammount of damages that not allowing them to use it anymore caused. They can do it of course, and they can be held liable for it if they do because it is a very clear case of acting in bad faith. Do you understand this?

562,"Yeah, I still don't buy Tesla's offer, either.

There are several things that Tesla could do to ""walk the talk"" with its patent offer:

1) It could expressly abandon its patents. All it takes is a one-page form filed with the USPTO.

2) It could publish, on its website, a form that grants a free, irrevocable license to its patents, already signed by Tesla. Just download the form and sign it, and *poof*, free license.

3) It could create a standards body to grant free patent licenses for companies that implement the technology ""fairly,"" according to some definition. Exhibit A for why standards bodies work: Wi-Fi, which is managed by the Wi-Fi Alliance.

Tesla hasn't taken any of those steps. Its sole action, literally, has been Musk's PR pledge not to sue anyone... which has no legally binding value whatsoever. Tesla could easily change its mind - or get bought out by another auto maker with a different agenda.

So while this pledge has conferred a ton of PR feel-good vibes on Tesla, it's legally meaningless.

Meanwhile, there are signs that Tesla might not quite mean what it says... like the fact that [it keeps pursuing and paying for new patents](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=tesla$.ASNM.&amp;OS=an/tesla$&amp;RS=AN/tesla$). Tesla has won, and paid the issue fee for, three new patents in May 2015, and six new patents in March 2015. Why would it maintain such extensive (and expensive!) efforts to expand its patent portfolio if it has no plans to enforce any of them, ever?

563,"&gt; Wouldn't that open the idea/invention up for someone else to patent? 

No, of course not. The patent remains within the public records of the USPTO, and counts as prior art against any later filings. In fact, the patents don't even need to have issued, *ever*, to have that effect - they only need to have been filed and published. (Even more importantly, the inventions constitute prior art if they are published or publicly released *anywhere* - including on Tesla's website. No need to file any patent applications whatsoever.)

&gt; Wouldn't that form need to be unique for each downloader...

Nope. Download it, sign it, date it... done. You could get a free, irrevocable, legally enforceable license to all of Tesla's patents (or any subset that it indicates). Don't even need to get Tesla to do anything else, if the form is pre-signed by Tesla.

&gt; Now that actually sounds like a great idea. But who pays for it?

Tesla Motors could pay for it - which would probably cost less than the fees for the patents that Tesla continues to pursue! - and/or it could be paid for by nominal fees from licensees. Any licensee that's serious about marketing automobile batteries and chargers can probably afford $2,000 to cover some of the costs of the standards body.

564,"&gt; Tesla needs to protect itself from other people patenting Tesla's ideas and then charging Tesla for use of those ideas.

That's called ""defensive patenting."" Thousands of companies routinely engage in that practice - including a top-tier network hardware vendor that I visited two weeks ago.

Defensive patenting is a perfectly valid strategy. But it's not even in the same ballpark as Tesla's portrayal of its situation - nor the tech community's misunderstanding of it.

&gt; Making something free and keeping it free is harder work than simply throwing it into the public domain and hoping that everyone will ""do the right thing"".

I totally agree. And that's why strategies like defensive patenting are legitimate. Other, more proactive strategies are also available - like standards bodies.

Again, the Wi-Fi Alliance is an excellent model here. You don't see a whole lot of lawsuits about Wi-Fi, do you? Either manufacturer v. manufacturer, or troll v. manufacturer? No - everyone just does their thing, works toward increasingly powerful products, and lets the Wi-Fi Alliance handle the licensing details. Intercompatibility is damn near 100%; yes, your Linksys Wi-Fi adapter will communicate perfectly through the generic Wi-Fi network stack on your computer with that Belkin Wi-Fi router over there. Great, right?

If Tesla were serious about wanting to promote lawsuit-free cooperative technology development, that's what it would do. Notice that it hasn't. Notice that it has continued to acquire patents. There are some hard questions here about whether Tesla means what it says.
