Now I realize that this sub has become for all intents and purposes the ""Run, Bernie, Run!"" cheer squad, but perhaps one of the devoted true believers can take time out of upvoting every ""Bernie Sanders is Awesome"" post to explain exactly how he can possibly win the nomination of a party that he's rejected, and that really doesn't want him as anything other than a foil for an actual Democrat?

After the civil war, transcendentalism faded away and the labor rights movement took off.

Bryan may have been a dominant political figure in Washington, but the Socialist Party of America, led by Eugene V.

Debs received 6% of the popular vote in the 1912 Presidential election, and 3% in 1920... when he was serving a ten year sentence in prison for sedition because he called on the American people to refuse to fight in WWI. Woodrow Wilson certainly thought Debs was more of a threat to traditional politics than Bryan.

   Don't get me wrong. I'm not just saying that most socialist states are corrupt and poor representations of socialism. I'm also saying that most alleged Western democracies are corrupt and poor representations of Democracy.

It's just like capitalism degraded into crony-capitalism.

It's a delicate balancing act. You have to weigh freedom versus corruption, convenience versus the People's rights.

Crony-capitalism can only happen with full state participation. The crony-capitalist needs the state to be strong so that it can illegally extract wealth from the citizens [which will then be funneled through to the crony-capitalist class]. 

But the answer is not to get rid of capitalism. Capitalism will always exist. It always has.

People will always trade and barter. If one guy has a silver coin and another guy has a sack of grain; and the one wants the silver coin more than the sack of grain (and, likewise, where the other wants the sack of grain more than the silver coin), they trade. Both parties are happy. Both sides win.

THAT'S capitalism.

Crony-capitalism is where one guy wants a sack of grain and, rather than pay for it himself, he gets a couple of corrupt cops to go and shake down a small business owner in order to extract money from him. The crony-capitalist then takes the ill-gotten gains and buys the sack of grain for himself.

Without the powerful goons, the crony-capitalist is powerless.

I want the goons gone. I want the crony-capitalist powerless and exposed.

No more sock-puppets. No more manipulations from the shadows.

Transparency would end 99% of it overnight. The cleansing disinfectant of light.

When people deal in abstractions--like God, or The State--they act as if it's some impartial, aloof party demanding their money.

It's always a psychological dodge to get people to think that they're not being robbed by individuals. Kind of like when you whack a dog for pooping on the carpet. Psychologists say to whack him with a rolled-up newspaper, because then the animal will associate the beating with the newspaper and not with you.

Likewise, when thieves hide behind abstractions to rob people.

""Oh, no, no, it's not me robbing you. It's this abstraction called 'government'. You'll be much more willing to part with your money if I tell you that it's an abstraction doing it.""

The reality is: The government is composed of people. 

And people can be corrupted. Politician A is more than happy to retire to a consulting position at a Wall Street firm for ten times what he made as a junior congressman--so long as he puts in a rider on a bill to funnel tax money through to Walmart.

Government has been turned into a money laundering business. A front. A clearing house for corrupt interests.

Republics can only exist so long as moral and incorruptible men are at the helm. I think Bernie Sanders fits this bill far more than anyone in the Republican or Democratic parties. He's so antagonistic to the crony-capitalists, so jaded by Wall Street that I think he'd act as a healthy foil to them. And he's so old and set in his ways, it's unlikely that he'll suddenly buckle under and capitulate. The dude's gonna be dead in a couple of years. He doesn't have a need for a lush consulting gig after leaving Congress.

For these reasons, I think he'd be a good choice to act as the People's advocate when dealing with these vultures.

I'm not convinced that people are *taxed* into poverty.

&gt; If the policies worked, they would be done so in the private market, then adopted by the public sector

Again, I disagree. Fundamental scientific research is often not immediately profitable, and a lot of it wouldn't get done without government funding. Long term research projects don't often look appealing to private businesses either, even if the potential return is enormous. What's private funding for fusion research look like compared to the (still inadequate) public funding?

More importantly, where's the economic incentive for power companies to reduce CO2 emissions? How could a program like SNAP be run by a private, for profit business? That's essentially charity work.

Just because something isn't *profitable* in capitalistic terms, doesn't mean it doesn't *work* or isn't *worthwhile*.

&gt; Policies should be tested out where the customer, or taxpayer, has an element of choice, so money isn't wasted on Iraq and the drug war or other ridiculous ventures that hold no value to society. 

You and I and Bernie are all in agreement over Iraq and drug policy.

&gt; So if what you spend on money matters, wouldn't you want the mechanism that provides the most choice, rather than the entity that restricts it?

Don't get me wrong, the market and private enterprise can be *very* efficient at a *lot* of things. I just don't think the market can fulfill every need in society. I think that private enterprise can actually *limit* choice in some ways and in some instances, but what's more essential is that I don't consider choice an intrinsic good. I'm sure you can think of an example when having only one or a couple of choices might be better than having a dozen, depending on what the choices are.

I don't see why providing government services even has to restrict choice, per se. We provide public schooling, but private schools exist. Canada has a national healthcare system, but private insurance still exists.

&gt; Also I could use your crying river argument with America, who gives a shit if we shed a few tears if millions are being fed in Africa. We don't do that because it violates property rights. 

It seems like you've missed the point I made about foreign impoverished nations and the *actual* living conditions of ~40% of Americans. If you took from the poorest Americans to feed Africa, they would literally go hungry themselves. Moreover, there are political complications and huge issues of logistics that make the analogy a radically different situation.

*President Bernie Sanders would dismantle NSA spying. ""Kids will grow up knowing that every damn thing that they do is going to be recorded somewhere in a file, and I think that will have a very Orwellian and inhibiting impact on our lives.""*

Somehow, we've jumped from Bernie Sanders believes NSA wiretapping is unconstitutional to 'Bernie Sanders promises to dismantle the NSA'. He didn't promise that, and it isn't good for him or anyone else to put those words in his mouth. He might dismantle the NSA, or he might not be able to do so for some reason. But the point remains, he didn't promise to do so. He only stated his position, which is really the more important thing anyways.

That's a little misleading FYI. [Here's the wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) with Primary voting in the run-up to 2008.

The following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:

* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, 

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%

Now, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):

* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% 

* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   

* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, 

* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%

So, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It's hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it's an insanely large difference.

Secondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus ""not-Hillary"" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary's level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains ""flat"" she'll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he'll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). 

Additionally, the ""not Hillary / Bernie"" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she's included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She's [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). 

If I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the '08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially ""Warren Lite"". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.

So where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)

-----------------------

**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama ""only"" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he'll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she's doing a better job positioning herself as the ""populist"" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn't chip away at her initial polling numbers.

[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]",13,0.156427068302,0.193848180368,0.39870045695,0.171114636186,0.6,0.55,626,0.0527777777778,27.2173913043,-0.0722222222222,0.416666666667

Though it has been shared a bit on social media, that line comes *only* from the headline of this article and all instances of it mention the *National Journal* as the sole source.  So, did Bernie actually say that, or was it just an implication that the author ran with?

Also, I would not be opposed to him dismantling the NSA's spying on American citizens.  It's not as if that it actually what the NSA is meant to do.  They have another purpose, and they should be fulfilling *it* instead of collecting data on their own citizens.  Dismantling their domestic spying operations would not stop them from fulfilling their original purpose.

Some of those ""steps"" are actual policies that I agree with, but some of them are just ""this is bad, we should do a good thing instead""

Saying that women should earn the same as men is easy, saying how you are going to do it is harder.  Saying that we need to craft trade agreements that encourage job creation in America is easy, saying how you are going to do it is harder.

To be specific:

1 and 2 are mostly spot on, and #3 is alright, though I'm not sure how it would be accomplished.  As a member of a union who wishes he wasn't, I just don't agree with #4 - for lots of reasons - but I can understand why many would agree with him and disagree with me.  #5 is silly, I am a supporter of getting rid of the minimum wage entirely (see my previous comment for what I believe to be a superior solution).  #6 is meaningless, I am sure we can all agree that bad things are bad, #7 speaks to what I mentioned before, except my comment was more specific (as opposed to, lets make less bad agreements, and more good ones!), #8 sounds good to me.  Again, not a step but just a good idea.  #9 Difficult to implement, but I agree - it is hard to argue that finance hasn't gotten out of control. #10 Preach it, Sanders #11 SS and Medicare have huge structural issues that need to be addressed.  This is a pretty meaningless statement if it does not mention and address these issues. #12 I disagree, corporations should pay absolutely nothing, because they are not people.  (Aside: They are not people, law should recognize that fact).  Taxes pervert markets, in ways many people find difficult to understand and believe.  Corporate taxes are not the answer.  

The thing is, people want corporations to pay taxes because they want to hit those rich owners.  Regardless of whether the owners are actually rich or not (irrelevant) - the better way to do this is through a progressive income tax.  Of course this would require a massive overhaul of many, many things, so please don't respond to this last point as if it would just be the elimination of the corporation tax and nothing else - because obviously that would be a terrible and inequitable thing to do.



Overall, Sanders does well - but I don't think he can possibly win, I am not confident he would be an effective leader and I am not confident he would be effective outside of the United States.

So while Sanders' decision to run as a Dem is in no way analogous to Nader's decision to run as an independent, IMO, supporting Sanders will likely have the same effect in the end and for the same reasons - Sanders does not stand much of a chance in the general (for all the reasons you know to be true but hope we can ""change"").

There are a few really old Justices and a few really young ones. There's a chance we can have the most liberal Court this country has ever seen and use it to push the country forward in a way never seen before. THIS is the most important issue facing America right now IMO and why I care quite a bit about the election.

&gt; 'mobilizing apathetic voters' is purely a feature of Democratic voters.

It is something a democratic candidate may or may not do.  Hillary may not, Sanders will.  That is just a compounding factor to why 2016 is a 0% chance republicans can win.  There will be enough people showing up just because it's a presidential election to make republicans unelectable.  

&gt; That may not be what you want to hear, but that is reality

You said alot of ""mays"" that is against reality.  Sanders has been going around the country himself, and he knows he has the grassroots support to win.  He said himself that if he didn't think he could win, he wouldn't run, because that would hurt his message.

Because there are 10% of voters saying they support Warren over Hillary.  4% support Sanders (and this was long before he announced running, and obviously before he started spending to get his name out, as that hasn't started yet.  3% are for other candidates, like Jim Webb.  The dem voters who read up and care, they are not for Hillary.  They'll be going to Sanders.  

Plus, he has already seen enough grassroots support to take on Hillary.  He's been going around the country this last year, to see.  

Right, Hillary has the big donors.  First of all, I'm pointing out that Sanders can spend big with reddit alone, so idk why you bring up that Hillary has corporate support.  The grassroots people for Obama (and a big reason why he won, it's not a ""machine"") were there for a liberal cause.  They deserted Hillary then, they will again.  You know how bad that will look, when Hillary is getting hundreds of millions in corporate money, and Sanders is doing well with grassroots alone?  She's going to need alot of luck for primary voters not to see that.  

Sanders has the grassroots.  He has the message and public speaking talent.  He also does not need to outspend Hillary.  He needs to have enough to get out frequently enough.  He can get that alone with reddit supporters giving $10-$15 dollar a month.

Now, it is true that being part of the winning party gives you most of the benefits.

(Not *entirely* true, of course, as many corporate donors ask for some of their people to be elevated, regardless of politics, but that's another story for another post.)

Remember in '08, when it was Hillary v Obama? Hillary lost, and then became Secretary of State. She was our foreign policy during those years. Also, going into the convention, the party forms their platform, and those with electoral votes usually have a large say in how that is formed. You might have notice how Hillary quickly changed many of her views to align with Bernie after he announced his candidacy.

While Americans focus on the One Person As President (again, with heavy media encouragement), it really is an Administration, with a lot of people forming and implementing the policy.

That means that even though he may not become president, he will have a greater power to influence policy over a HClinton WH than as a senator. He might be named Vice President, or Secretary of the Treasury, Interior, Energy, Commerce.

If Sanders doesn't win, which is a high likely hood, Clinton will be facing a challenger who hasn't had the same attack adds thrown at them for the past year. 

There are at least 2 Supreme Court justices up for retirement and the next president will likely impliment them. Considering the conservative dream team has passed such golden rulings as the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, gutting the birthcontrol mandate in the Hobby Lobby case because of factually incorrect opinions, and Citizens United I'd say it's pretty god damn important more conservative justices don't get implimented. 

Sanders knows that this is our reality which is also likely why he isn't running as an independant. It is possible to run a successful campaign based on one's own platform without having to join the right in their attacks against Clinton. 

For anyone that is a pie in the sky idealist: Clinton is likely to win. I wish Sanders would win, but just because reddit likes him doesn't change reality.

If Bernie Sanders were to branch off and create a modernized form of the Progressive Party (1924 version, not Bullmoose version), he would have my vote in a second over another Clinton or Bush. 

Even if he were to break off entirely from the Democrats/Independents and form something more akin to the Bullmoose Party in order to run additional candidates, I could absolutely see that party gaining a minor foothold in the more liberal regions of the country.

I know this is almost entirely out of the realm of possibility (partly because I think Warren would make a better Supreme Court Justice than VP) but a Sanders/Warren ticket would gather *at least* 10-15% of the popular vote.

The Progressive parties of the early 1900's set the stage for the Golden Age of Progressivism (Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, la Follette, and later acolytes of the movement such as FDR), it's worth noting that we might be witnessing a similar generational shift in the present day.

If Hillary was truly getting donations from a random smattering of New Yorkers (unrealistic, I know), you'd see more of these names on the list. They're not. A heavy concentration of her donations are coming from a very specific sector- one that does not account for a (relatively) large number of New Yorkers. This reflects (1) the massive amounts of money present in these institutions and (2) Hillary's evident sympathies for those types of institutions.  Both points give me reason enough to vote for Bernie Sanders.

In 2014, he sponsored [Senate bill S.1982](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1982) to expand veteran's medical benefits (although this was [procedurally killed by the Republicans](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/199480-gop-blocks-veterans-bill) for being ""too expensive"", which I personally find infuriatingly outrageous).  

Based on Sanders' platform and voting history, I think that military veterans would get a level of support they've never had before from a Sanders administration.  He's consistently voted against unnecessary and pre-emptive wars and has never failed to demand that we compensate veterans for serving in America's wars.  I think it is safe to say that the military has no better friend in the Senate.",4,-0.0142857142857,0.174270968237,0.359523809524,0.215319376421,0.533333333333,0.633333333333,181,0.104761904762,25.8571428571,0.125,0.166666666667

Secondly, I typically don't like propaganda either, but in the this case its entirely necessary. Do you really think that the American voting population is educated enough to make decisions for itself? No, of course not. When many people hear Democratic Socialist, they think about the good old USSR and communists. Bernie needs to lure them in with things that they want to hear. Its definitely a process, and until he builds name recognition and people start to get over his label, he won't have a chance. How does Bernie Sanders gain followers without being provocative and popular? Sure its all PR, but that doesn't mean he doesn't believe in what he says and doesn't have specific plans to implement change. When we get to the debates and candidates are asked specific questions, we'll get specific answers. Until then, its all about awareness. But if you do want some specifics, please feel free to read any of his [341 sponsored bills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357) and I think you'll be able to see how he specifically wants to change the country.

&gt;Sure its all PR, but that doesn't mean he doesn't believe in what he says and doesn't have specific plans to implement change.

I completely agree, and I believe Sanders is a quality candidate. My comment is not a knock on Sanders at all, just on Reddit's hypocritical and naive response to the media articles that are posted.

I'm not talking about Sanders speeches or his viewpoints as a whole, I'm talking about specifically the Sanders related content on Reddit. While you're right that Sanders himself does give much more fleshed out perspectives, a VAST majority of the posts about him on Reddit are 1-2 sentences or sensationalist rhetoric and a link to an article that 99% of the commenters do not read.

That's my issue, that people here on Reddit are praising this guy based on these blatantly propagandist quotes about ""fighting the big guy"" and ""staging a revolution"". There is little to no rational discussion about Sanders as a politician or any realistic talk about what kind of changes and reforms he could potentially push for if elected. It's just a classic /r/politics circlejerk about ""tax the rich! hold wall street accountable!"", and people are praising Sanders unquestioningly and without a sufficiently rational or reasonable perspective on both his stances on issues and the current political climate in which he would be forced to try to launch reform from.

It's just frustrating seeing people follow him like sheep based on the sensationalist article headlines that are posted here, especially when /r/politics spends so much time criticizing the voting populace (especially right-wing voters) for being ignorant and blindly believing right-wing propaganda. They're just doing the exact same thing, except now it's acceptable to be sucked into the media's propaganda as long as their propaganda fits in with Reddit's anti-rich, anti-establishment left-wing narrative.

Unfortunately the scenario ends up being that Obama gets elected, then with the incumbency being what it is he has little to work with and since the populace is so masochistic about politics they don't vote people into office who truly care to make changes, though it's difficult to blame the populace when the people who truly care can't actually even run.

All of his climate change activism didn't come until after the election was over. At that time was also the height of the fair trade/anti-glob protests, which started under Clinton and were much larger and more intense than occupy. Meanwhile, George Bush was campaigning as a centrist, nothing like how he ended up once in power.

Money unequivocally buys access to politicians; the only difference I can really see between the GOP and the Dems is that Dems go out and court wealthy donors; GOP are courted by wealthy magnates.

(Bernie Sanders is the only presidential candidate who doesn't seem to have allowed access by wealthy donors, being the proverbial ""exception that proves the rule."")

The rest of your post I agree with; Bradley Smith's analysis seems correct, reasonable, and much more workable than overturning Citizens United. Total dollar expenditures are not an indicator of success, but in the Dem primary I see it being much more difficult for Sander's small donor approach to raise enough money to be able to match what Hillary can spend having courted large donors.

Sanders is not going to get involved in the political skulduggery of the election. Instead he's going to argue policy and policy alone. That's going to be very refreshing. 

The Democratic nomination could end up being a very civil argument over policy, which would help unify the Democratic Platform.

A major part of Obama winning in 2008 was he was able to win Iowa off of oration and a brilliant background in community organizing (particularly helped in caucuses which he did better in) and he was plugged in enough to peel off super delegates from Clinton. Ted Kennedy might have been so important that it won him the nomination in all honesty. Sanders has had virtually no backing from inside the party like Obama did, he's not even been a democrat before now and super delegates matter a lot, he's popular among young progressives in the party but that's about where his reach ends, could he theoretically build up a name? I suppose so, but he's much more likely to flame out. To me and to be completely harsh he seems like a less electable Elizabeth Warren. He's not the first candidate to run on positions like he's currently running. Dennis kuchinich ran on many similar issues and never gained real traction. Sanders would be considered on the far end of American politics, that's not who usually gets the nomination. Romney, McCain, Obama all have been more centered politicians, granted bush wasn't and you can argue Kerry wasn't though I think an argument could be made either way, bill Clinton certain was, as was al gore. It's hard for more liberal or more conservative candidates to get a nomination, not impossible but difficult, bush was able to do it with a great family name, dirty campaigning especially against McCain in the primary, and Karl rove.

15 Bernie Sanders links on the front page at one time, and you're accusing me of falling victim to propaganda.

I despise the GOP as much as the next guy. I mean it's hard not to. Many Democrats are influenced by the same big business, and not all big business is evil. But the thing that I don't get is, what exactly is the *solution*? Tax the shit out of them? Make campaigns publicly funded? I agree with the latter, but unfortunately our Supreme Court has deemed that unconstitutional, so it's *very* hard to implement. The government protects inefficient monopolies in some industries, but not all of them. I'm not sure of any company that receives ""our tax dollars"", I believe most pay taxes even if it's arguably less than they should be. 

I guess my point is, on /r/politics I see a lot of anti-billionaire, anti-corruption drivel and support for people who speak on those things without actually proposing any real-world solution. Bernie Sanders, for example, is a union whore judging by his funding. Come over to California to see a labor union poster child at work. Once unions get big enough they do just as much for the little guy as the corporations they speak up against. I guess my point is the problem is a lot bigger than just needing to vote for someone who promises to get the rich out of influence.

The closest thing the GOP has done to governing is setting up redundant committees investigating the Benghazi ordeal in the hopes of finding evidence that proves their nonsensical conspiracies about Clinton. They already loathe her and have loathed her since Bill was President. Her moderate tone, backing from the Dem establishment and connection with her husband's connections won't change that.

"" Despite his own claims, Sanders has not been an antiwar leader. Ever since he won election to the House, he has taken either equivocal positions on U.S. wars or outright supported them. His hawkish positions -- especially his decision to support Bill Clinton's 1999 Kosovo War -- drove one of his key advisers, Jeremy Brecher, to resign from his staff. Brecher wrote in his resignation letter, Is there a moral limit to the military violence you are willing to participate in or support?

So outraged were peace activists over Sanders' support of the Kosovo War that they occupied his office in 1999. Sanders had them arrested. Under the Bush regime, Sanders' militarism has only grown worse. While he called for alternative approaches to the war on Afghanistan, he failed to join the sole Democrat, Barbara Lee, to vote against Congress resolution that gave George Bush a blank check to launch war on any country he deemed connected to the September 11 attacks.

Many people don't understand the urgency of this election. That's understandable - every election is ""the most important one"" nowadays - but consider this:

Currently 
Ruth Bader Ginsberg is 82
Anton Scalia is 79
Anthony Kennedy is 78
Stephen Breyer is 75.

In 2020/2024,
Ruth Bader Ginsberg will be 87/92
Anton Scalia will be 84/89
Anthony Kennedy will be 83/88
Stephen Breyer will be 80/85

In the next presidential term it is very likely ( a near certainty if re-elected) that we will see 3 or 4 retirements (Ginsberg likely intends to die on the bench and is in great health so hopefully isn't going anywhere... Notorious RBG does what she want).

The pool of qualified lawyers and judges is limited. Hillary and Sanders will likely have similar selections to fill these positions. 

Hillary is far mor electable than Sanders. I love the guy, have for a while, but part of the reason I love him is because he's the closest America has to a socialist, and that makes him unelectable in the here and now - socialist is still a dirty word, as silly as that is. I want to see this change. I want someone with Sanders's views to lead the country. But now is not the time to risk it.

The next president will likely be a foreign policy president - it's what we need above anything. Obama's domestic agenda is pretty much done, and the economy is in a position that's stable. We need a president who will defend that progress and then focus on cleaning up the foreign policy mess that the world is in right now - Hillary Clinton is pretty much the most qualified person do do this (aside from Joe Biden, who's just about as honest and respectable as Sanders but is a little more tolerability centrist from a national perspective - please Joe, please run...)

This is an election that primarily needs a democrat to win because of the SCOTUS appointments approaching - all else is secondary. After that, though, we need someone with foreign policy skills who will give the nation time to acclimate to the thought of more liberal policies in the future. We need time to overcome some of the stigma and propaganda associated with American far-left liberal ideas before we can legitimately run s Sanders. Essentially, we need a domestic care-taker president. Find a young Sanders now and start getting them ready for 2028 or 2032. The country is pushing back against going conservative too quickly - let's not jeopardize the opportunities we have now by going liberal faster than the country can stand.

815,"Well, since you ask so nicely.

Overall: The premise is that had Bernie decided to challenge Shumlin for the Gubernatorial office, he could have used that position as a base to build a statewide Progressive Party analogous to the organization he built in Burlington.  That's unlikely, and here is why:

- All Vermont politics is intensely personal.  Bernie has a strong *personal* following (he's not a nice guy, but he's widely seen as honest and straightforward), rather like a fiscally conservative Republican Governor, Richard Snelling.  Snelling was downright rude, abrasive and difficult to deal with.  But he kept getting elected, and when he retired he was succeeded by a liberal Democrat (Madeline Kunin) who proceeded to muck up the budget.  Snelling came back and fixed it again with a stunning deal between him and the powerful Democratic leader of Congress.  It was Snelling's unexpected fatal heart attack that put then Lt. Governor Howard Dean - remember him? - into the Governor position.  Dean, brilliantly, immediately announced that he hadn't been elected to anything, was going to implement Snelling's program and leave Snelling's people in place in the government.  Vermonters thought this was pretty classy and re-elected Dean in his own right with a massive majority.  So Vermont had a very fiscally conservative (and rude) Governor, followed by a Liberal (and wishy washy - she was known as ""Straddlin' Madeline"") spendthrift, followed by a ""Jeezum Crow, I gotta clean up the f*cking mess *again*?"" return, followed by a moderate Democrat who acted like a conservative Republican and fought tooth and nail with the Progressive wing of his own party.  Dean called them ""kooks"" and ""nutcases"" and ""idiots"" - and that was in public.  Do you see strong ideologies at play here?  Me neither.
  
 -  The takeaway here is that Vermont politics is not so much ideology based as personality based.  People like Bernie and trust him, but outside of the enclaves of the Progressive Party, notably Greater Burlington and a few other cities, the PP doesn't have a lot of traction.

- On Shumlin's failures as Governor (labeled betrayal).  Shumlin did come in promising single payer health care in Vermont.  It was to be the centerpiece of his administration.  Very unfortunately, the launch of the Vermont health care portal - a custom programming job for goodness sake, so that it could be unique to Vermont - was a much bigger disaster than the Federal portal.  It still doesn't work, and the Governor has said if it's not fixed by the end of May, it's going to be scrapped and Vermont will just use the Federal software. (Or maybe not.  There's been some hemming and hawing about this.  Heads have rolled, but not Shumlin's.)

  -   We spent millions and millions on the custom site.  That's enough to piss everybody off, just to start with, and is one big reason that Shumlin came very very close to losing his seat in the last election.

 -    Shumlin had already annoyed the Legislature by refusing to discuss how the single payer plan was to be financed.  Various Democrats (and the exceptionally weak for now) Republicans kept asking, before the election, ""Ummm.  Pete?  How we gonna pay for this?  What will it cost?  We'd kinda like to know, if you don't mind.""  After the election, the Administration came out and said, ""Oops.  Sorry.  Too expensive.""  The blithe statement that the cost could be covered by ""taxing the rich"" is just too disingenuous for words.  Remember there are only 600,000 people in the whole state, and the wealthiest tend to be retirees.  They can (and do) establish winter residencies in income tax free Florida but spend summers here.  There aren't enough 1%'ers here to finance single payer.  It would take a broad based payroll tax, and few people were really eager for that.

- Bernie as mayor of Burlington.  Yes, his supporters were called Sanderistas.  He did spend a lot of time and effort talking about Central America.  A famous quote from a disgruntled member of the city council was, ""El Salvador!  El Salvador!  What about El Burlington?"".  *However* - and it isn't something you read a lot about in the hagiography of Sanders - he was very practical and actually listened to the Old Guard that had run Burlington for decades.  He didn't always agree, of course, but when he wanted to accomplish something practical for the city, he brought them in and they helped.  He did a lot of good for Burlington and is one of the reasons that it still has a thriving downtown despite the Big Box stores on the perimeter.  And if housing is expensive, there is still some working class housing available.  (Although many people complain it's filled with UVM students pushing out the Burlingtonians.  The city keeps hammering on the University to build more on campus housing - it's an annual fight.)  Bernie talked a lot about Central America but he still got things done for Burlington.

- Sanders has ""uncritically supported the Democrats in Vermont"".  Um, yes, but no.  Bernie is not playing on the Vermont stage, he's playing on the DC stage.  It's often a bad idea for DC politicians to interfere in State level politics, particularly outside of the electoral cycle.  A campaign appearance or two, maybe a pancake breakfast fund raiser here or there, sure.  But Bernie directly attacking Shumlin's policies in Vermont would be kind of offensive, even to us Sanders admirers.  ""Mind your own business, Bernie"" would be the tart reply.

- The Great F-35 fight.  This is a local hot potato.  On the one hand, you have a long standing Air National Guard base in Burlington, Vermont (sent to patrol NYC on 911, no less), which provides a lot of good jobs, and gives tiny little Burlington airport really state of the art avionics, runway clearing (helicopters blow light fluffy snow off sometimes - it's fun to watch), and generally make it possible to fly in and out in frequent bad weather.  The F-35s had to be located somewhere, and a mix of upper middle class professions in South Burlington (where the airport is) went all NIMBY on it, aided by the old Left who just generally hate anything military.  After much turmoil, South Burlington voters went with the pro F-35 crowd, as did the entire Vermont Congressional delegation.  The city of Burlington bought out a strip of houses next to the airport just in case the F-35 turns out to be as loud as some shrilly say it is.  I don't know and arguments are ongoing.

Well, that turned into a wall of text, even if I tried to restrict myself to the Vermont comments.

Edit: So, I feel like I should address what I meant considering the large number of replies implying I don't understand how the executive branch works. Trust me, I do know how it works. My initial response was a remark at how nearly every post on /r/politics about the presidential elections or just presidents in general for quite some time have had comments get upvoted clamoring for the use of more and more executive orders. It was meant to address the attitude people have that what we need is immediate, swift, and conclusive action by a single person to fix everything that has ever been wrong in our country. That attitude is dangerous.

On the note of the purpose of executive orders, they are merely a means of issuing how all offices under the executive branch should carry out a law enacted by congress. It's disheartening to me to see a large number of people wanting the executive order to turn into something akin to Palpatine's authority. 

People replying to me also seem to believe for some reason that I'm trying to protect the big bad banks from the glorious good of the government. I'm not. In fact, above all else I support wholeheartedly what Sanders is doing. It should be the legislative branch that issues any law to break up the banks. In addition, we should stop viewing our Presidents as these all powerful beings who should wave their dicks/vaginas around exercising power they shouldn't have. If you honestly believe the executive branch hasn't been accumulating power over the last thirty years or more you're blind.

902,"I can try to explain the bill, but it is pretty heavy oil and gas tax law, so if you have no accounting or finance background then it may be difficult for me to adequately explain it. I'm going to use tax jargon so I can keep my explanation as brief as possible. 

Here is the bill: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s1041/text

First note that I cannot give an informed opinion on the entirety of the bill. My knowledge is limited to tax law, which isn't discussed until Section 15 of the bill. All prior sections amend law that is not part of the tax code. I'm also going to skip provisions to code sections I am unfamiliar with and are not easy to grasp with a single read.

Things I personally agree with or don't care either way:
*Removing IRC Sec. 43. This credit only applies when oil is below $34 per barrel, which it hasn't been in quite some time.

*Removing IRC Sec. 45I. This credit only applies when oil is below $18 per barrel, see above.

*Removing IRC Sec. 45K. This credit only applies when oil is below $29.50 per barrel,
^Those provisions essentially clean up the tax code, with no real economic impact. 

*Removing IRC Sec. 263(c). This one is going to be a bit trickier to explain. This section allows an oil and gas company to deduct ""Intangible Drilling and Development Costs"" (IDCs) immediately, as opposed to capitalizing these costs into the basis of the lease and depleting them over the life of the well. This does not change the dollar amount of deduction an oil and gas company can take, just the timing. It is probably the most lucrative section in the tax code for growing oil companies. Currently, large integrated oil companies (there are currently five, think Exxon sized) are already limited to taking 70% deduction on IDCs and amortize the remaining amount of 60 months. This provision was enacted in the 1954 Code to ease the pain of risk, since oil and gas exploration is still one of the riskiest businesses out there with a very small success rate for wells even after collecting seismic data. This would hurt oil and gas companies, but at the same time bring them in line with the capitalization rules that all other businesses have to adhere to.

*Amending IRC Sec. 167(h) to change the amortization period of Geological and Geophysical (G&amp;G) expenditures from 24 months to 7 years. If you look at early case law, G&amp;G was deemed a capital expenditure, so it would be depleted over the life of the lease. The production of wells is usually around 10-20 years, so even at 7 years (current time period of large integrated companies) it could be slightly advantageous over pure capitalization.

That ends the amendments I could see as fair alterations to bring oil and gas taxation in line with the rest of the business community.

Here's where he loses me.

*Removing IRC Sec. 613A. This is another area that is difficult to explain. As a precursor, I would like to say that when Senator Sanders introduced this bill, he stated he wanted to end subsidies to large oil companies. Large oil companies cannot utilize this provision. 
One big issue with oil and gas extraction, is that landowners most often also own the mineral rights beneath the land. When they purchased the land, they do not allocate a basis to the minerals in place, so there is no depletable asset. This code section allows a deduction based on gross revenue received, so that people are compensated for having their resources removed from the ground. There is an exhaustive list of minerals that are eligible for percentage depletion, I think its well over 100. This provision is limited to an average production of 1,000 barrels per day, so relatively large (nonintegrated) oil companies like Anadarko with 42,000 barrels per day can only percentage deplete 2.5% of their production. This provision aids small oil companies and mineral owner and greatly helped the West Texas economy in the most recent oil boom. So in short, this screws smaller produces, does not effect the largest, and has a small effect on the relatively large.

*Removing IRC Sec. 193. This would disallow deductions for utilizing tertiary injection. If you want to outlaw tertiary injection in the US that is one thing, but this would disallow deducting it for projects abroad as well, leaving US companies at a significant disadvantage. Not a well thought out policy.

*Removing IRC Sec. 199(d)(9). This is under the Domestic Production and Activities Deduction. This is a general manufacturing provision that allows companies to deduct an additional 9% off of taxable income if they utilize enough american labor within US borders. Currently oil and gas is restricted to 6%, but this would eliminate it entirely for oil and gas. This would cause US oil to become more expensive while singling out oil and gas as one of the very few industries that is not available to utilize this code section. Also, screws the little guy, does lesser damage to larger.

That is all of the in-depth analysis I have energy for tonight. I also don't like the modification of foreign tax treatment, completely disallowing expensing clean up efforts, and the additional 13% proposed tax on oil extracted from the Gulf of Mexico.

----------------------------------

Using the Obama primary campaign as a comparison, what is the likelihood of Sanders' campaign against Clinton succeeding? [Here's the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.

The following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:

* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, 

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%

Now, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):

* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% 

* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   

* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, 

* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%

So, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It's hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it's an insanely large difference.

Secondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus ""not-Hillary"" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary's level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains ""flat"" she'll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he'll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). 

Additionally, the ""not Hillary / Bernie"" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she's included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She's [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). 

If I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the '08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially ""Warren Lite"". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.

So where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)

-----------------------

**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama ""only"" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he'll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she's doing a better job positioning herself as the ""populist"" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn't chip away at her initial polling numbers.

[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]

With the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890), Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), Robinson-Patman Act (1936), and the Hart-Scoss-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act (1976)  he can break up the banks and too big to fail businesses. 

He has proven time and again that he is willing to fight for issues that do not seem to have a chance of passing. See the bills he has cosponsored, [here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357).

The presidency also has a lot of power over things such as NSA spying, trade policy, and constant invasions of foreign countries which are some of his major issues.

On top of these, there are the numerous potential supreme court slots opening up which would affect U.S. policy for decades.

Him becoming president over any one else would mean a huge difference no matter how much the media and others try to downplay him or marginalize his potential in the office.",8,0.0829166666667,0.148755848815,0.575625,0.33085076952,0.516666666667,0.75,237,0.0530303030303,21.5454545455,0.266666666667,0.733333333333

1047,"I think it is you that do not fully understand how vague the term socialism can be by itself. Going with the simple oxford definition. Socialism is when the means of production are owned by the community (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/socialism). The result of this in practice is state owned businesses (but it can in theory be on other forms as well, but this is the most common by far).  

This means that what socialism is can be rather vague at times, but this does include countries such as Cuba, North Korea, (the former) Soviet Union, and arguably Venezuela (all of these countries are mostly socialist). There are also many countries with socialist attributes such as France, but these countries still have a free market and there therefore by definition not socialist. 

As I said in previous comments theory can be very different from reality and this is very true for socialism. In theory socialism can be a very moral kind of government that truly cares for its people. However as can be seen in history this does not always play out. 

The problem with socialism in reality is abuse of power. All the countries I mentioned as socialist (even North Korea to some extent) started with good intentions for their people. However in socialism there is absolutely no way of regulating the political elite as they hold all the political and economic power. The result of this is that the political elite can do whatever they want which leads to abuse of power. Examples of this includes slave labor as can be seen in North Korea and an in the former Soviet Union.

Another problem I mentioned was little incentive to work. By this I meant that there was no reason for people to work hard in a socialist country because they all get paid pretty much the same anyways. This is not accounted for in socialist theory, but is the case in reality. One good example of this is how in Cuba you could a few years ago find doctors and engineers driving taxis because taxi drivers got paid more (because of tips by tourists). 

It is also worth pointing out the 2 main forms of socialism. There is state socialism and libertarian socialism. What I have discussed above mostly falls under state socialism (except for the incentive argument). Libertarian socialism is probably what you mean when you say socialism as this is the kind that is viewed as the most moral. The problem however with libertarian socialism is that it does not work at all. I could go more in depth here, but to keep things shorter I will use an example. If I lived in a libertarian socialist country and I started a restaurant (where I had to grow all the vegetables and raise all the animals I was going to use) then the government would have to shut me down or force me to become government (if not then the restaurant would technically be a private business which socialism is opposed to). This does not sound very free nor moral as I am not allowed to enjoy the fruits of my labor. This goes on to the issue of dictatorship of the majority. In a socialist society it is the 51% that rules. While this might sound nice it leaves out 49% of the people. These 49% are not very free as they coerced to do whatever the 51% wanna do. They simply do not have a choice. The result of this is that freedom in any form of socialist society is rather reduced and that a free society can not be 100% socialist. A free society can have many socialist attributes, but will in the end not be fully socialist. The society Bernie Sanders wants is not a socialist society. It is a society with some socialist attributes. He does not wish to eliminate the free market, but instead wants to regulate it more than has previously been done.

Please before you reply understand that I'm arguing socialism in practice, not in theory. The theory sounds really nice, but is more or less useless since it is so different from real life socialism.",1,0.150993913494,0.221079053844,0.463728169978,0.258065987556,1.2,0.8,699,0.0176322418136,18.3947368421,0.2,0.1
1048,"&gt; After all, in 2014 republicans destroyed democrats. 

You're overlooking the fact that there is generally at least a 20% difference in turnout during presidential election years than midterms. Statistically, democrats don't vote in midterm elections and that's nothing new. 

&gt;The flip side of this, which is very real, is that if someone like Bernie Sanders wins the nomination

Please show me where I once mentioned Sander's. Just because he and Hillary are the only people that actually get talked about doesn't really mean anything right now. A great deal can change alot in 17 months. Right now Hillary is leading based largely on two factors, *gender* and *name recognition*

&gt;I read a poll that said many Republican women would vote for her, upwards of like 30%, although I have no source at my finger tips at the moment.

I think that says a great deal about both Hillary's moderate-right views and dissatisfaction with the GOP among more moderate republicans.

Bottom line is that it's too early to declare a winner. Suggesting that she's guaranteed to win if nominated is misleading because that could be true of any moderate democratic candidate. The republicans are looking at Rubio(40%), Bush, or Huckabee(42%). Bush(53%) is a complicated choice because of the silent disdain among republicans for his brother. They've been pretending for the past 8 years that the G.W. presidency never happened and nominating John Ellis Bush would mean that they would have to face their past, something republicans really aren't good at. Rubio could garner support among minority groups, just as Obama did in 2008 and 2012, though in states with strict voter I.D. laws that may prove more difficult than before. Finally, I don't actually know enough about Huckabee to comment on his campaign but he's currently in the top 3. Following them, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are tied for 37% and Rick Perry sits at 36%. Cruz is too far right for democrats and a large number of independents. Rick Perry is an idiot(he was my state's governor for a decade unfortunately), and if Rand Paul can figure out what the hell he even stands for than he may have a shot.

However, as I've said repeatedly alot can change in 17 months among both republicans and democrats. It's two early to declare a winner right now.   ",1,0.135712620713,0.277463611935,0.51203962704,0.276466403083,1.3,1.0,409,0.0619834710744,18.5909090909,0.28,0.295

edit: And just to throw this out there. I think a Bernie Sanders Presidency could bring real progressive change to this country even with a Republican controlled congress. There are powers that the executive branch has but haven't been used by establishment democrats like Obama and Hilary that are funded by Wall Street. 

1.) The president has the power to break up big banks with out having to go through congress. He will need to go through the Supreme Court, but it is worth noting that it is speculated that 3 justices will be nominated by the next president so I think he could have the support.

2.) The president has power over trade deals. Currently Obama is working on a free trade deal within the Pacific rim called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). The scary this about this is that no one is allowed to know what policies the TPP contains until after congress approves it, they aren't even allowed to read it before voting. Sanders is the only announce presidential potential that is against it and as president he wouldn't need congress to act, and it is worth noting that [Sanders largest donations vs Hilary's](http://i.imgur.com/GCOVi0J.png) is really just Union and labor groups vs Wall Street.

1075,"You're making a few fundamental errors.

First, there is a difference between a socialist and a democratic socialist.  The former wants to replace the capitalist economic system with a socialist economic system.  A democratic socialist on the other hand wants to maintain the capitalist economic system for the majority of the economy but mitigate capitalism's negative attributes by socializing essential services and provide a social safety net.  It is the middle ground between pure lase-fare capitalism and total socialism.

To a fair extent the US is already a social democratic country.  Many essential services are socialized, pre-college education, police and fire services, most roads, some healthcare, ect.  And we have a social safety net if a weak one.  What Sanders wants to do is really just an evolutionary change rather than a revolutionary one by expanding what services are socialized and strengthening the social safety net.  Oh, and increasing labor rights, the other major piece of the social democratic system I left out.

Now, as to the NSA, seem to be falling for the Republican dichotomy of big vs small government.  As should be clear from the strong GOP support for the NSA this simplistic view is false.  The real debate isn't about the size of government it is about the role of government.

Take libertarians.  They are not for smaller government for the sake of smaller government.  Rather, they believe in reducing the role of government to just a few fundamental areas like protecting property rights and resolving disputes.  That results in a smaller government but that is a by product not the goal.

Democratic socialists believe that a fundamental role of government should be to ensure people's needs are met. The reason for this is that if a person is not having their basic needs met or in fear of losing the ability to meet those basic needs they are vulnerable to  coercion and so are not truly free.

Whether mass surveillance is a good idea or not is really an unrelated issue.  People greatly value privacy.  It allows us to escape the pressure to conform to social expectations.  But some of these social expectations we can mostly agree are good, an extreme example being the social pressure for a pedophile to not molest children.  Or these expectations can be as harmless as holding an opinion that others in your social circle would disagree with.

The conflict is should people be able to escape social expectations or should they be under constant pressure to behave.  It isn't an issue that fits the standard one-dimensional left vs right spectrum because it really is an issue of authoritarianism vs anti-authoritarianism and there are both leftwing and rightwing authoritarians and anti-authoritarians.  It is a completely different political dimension.

Social Democrats like Sanders tend to be fairly anti-authoritarian.  It is the primary division between democratic socialism and communism which is extremely authoritarian.  And if you are wondering how a democratic socialist can be anti-authoritarian when they are for ""big government"" it is because of a difference in the perception of authority.  To the social democrat opposing the power of government is but one power to oppose.  The power of wealth and of institutional religion must not also be allowed to become controlling authorities either.  The fundamental goal of democratic socialism is to use democracy to direct the authority of government in opposition to the authority of wealth and religion and to achieve a balance.

tl:dr Sanders is a moderately anti-authoritarian democratic socialist.",14,0.0948761261261,0.199362676536,0.326608751609,0.2148441566,1.0,0.75,586,0.0820668693009,17.2352941176,0.0,0.7

1083,"The size of the bank is determined by the size of their portfolio. Now, the problem isn't that there is ONE huge bank cornering the market. That would be a problem, but it isn't the problem facing America. The real issue is that the world has 10 or 15 banks that are so huge that they dominate planetary finance. They are huge not because they have cornered the American market, but because, together, they have cornered planetary finance. Most of these banks are American, or have gigantic operations in the USA, but a smaller proportion of them are British, German, Swiss, French, or Japanese. (Note: I'm including investment banks).

This is actually good for America because planetary profits for American banks are taxed by the US government, becoming a de facto taxation from the US on planetary trade. This is the system that enables the American Empire and American supremacy.

It does have its short comings, though. It makes those banks ""too big to fail"".

If you forced those banks to be broken in America, the reason why they're big (planetary finance) wouldn't go away, so they would most likely just relocate their headquarters from New York to London, or a similar finance-friendly city. They wouldn't stop being too big to fail the world economy. They would just stop operating as a unit in the US. They would be replaced by smaller banks without the scale to compete at a planetary level. So, it would be the end of US-dominated international finance. It may cause some strain on international finance while the banks re-adjust, particularly because the US represents a quarter of planetary GDP. But the banks will survive, just outside of America.

As for using your credit card, well, the banks that move outside of the US and continue to dominate the world's financial system, will have higher cost of servicing the smaller US banks. At the same time, they will have larger scale and power than the smaller US banks, so they will force fees upon them, which would be borne by the customer. Of course, you can either pay fortunes to use your credit card when abroad, assuming the smaller American banks can come to terms with their gigantic planetary competitors, or you could just not use it. I've seen people from countries with small national banks (Argentina, Mexico, some African countries) struggling to use their nationally-issued credit card abroad and fail. The super rich in those countries have ""internationally certified"" credit cards that they can use abroad because they are paid abroad too, through affiliates. But for most people, that's uncommon. That is how the world looks like with small banks, and that's the world that Bernie Sanders wants: one where there is less economic activity because finance is hindered.

&gt;At the same time, they will have larger scale and power than the smaller US banks, so they will force fees upon them, which would be borne by the customer.

How can a bigger bank force a smaller bank to pay them fees? what are these fees for? That's a tax, which a bank cant impose.

Corruption is rampant in our government and the wealthy run this country. With that said though, Sanders is the first politician I have ever been excited about. He is the first candidate, at least in my lifetime, that has truly been for the people. So, for this election, I'm going to go all out and try to be the change I want to see in this country. I will not only be voting in the primaries, I will be volunteering for his campaign. Something I never ever thought I would do. I will go door to door, I will make phone calls, I will place signs. Whatever helps. I feel like if we want things to change we need to step up and try to be that change. Complacency is what has landed us where we are in the first place. 

I think bernie said it best himself. His presidential run is going to see, once and for all, whether or not a candidate who isn't funded by billionaires can even stand a chance in the modern day election. And while I think him getting the nomination is a huge longshot, it doesn't hurt to try. In a way, this will be a giant social experiment. If he fails, maybe it will just add to the frustration of every day Americans and spur some change in the future. And if he gets the nomination somehow, then I don't think him getting elected is too far fetched. 

My main point is that there is no hurt in trying. If we all want to be apathetic and completely disillusioned with the system, maybe we should all try, just once, to help the only candidate that wants to make a difference. If he fails I will give up all hope for this countries political process for sure. But I figure I might as well try to be part of the change I want to see before completely giving up.

You are absolutely right that most of the major banks, if not all, hold a variety of assets in a variety of industries and in a variety of geographies. My point was to ague against exactly what Bernie Sanders is proposing....that by breaking up the banks, some how you will end up with less risk. If anything, Canada's model of having a very small (in terms of number of players) banking industry comprised of large, diverse banks has proven to reduce systemic risk more so than the US model that consists of over six thousand FDIC insured banks. The simple reality is smaller banks have less scale and fewer abilities and thus are unable to diversify as well as larger banks. If you break them up, you will likely end up with a less healthy banking system, and will end up with a bunch of smaller banks that over time try to merge in order to achieve economies of scale, diversity geographically, and expand their service offerings. Ultimately you end up right back where we are today. So I don't support Sander's strategy here, but that is just my opinion.

Now, why would I say that? First of all this is an internet poll, which by its very definition is highly specious. But as far as internet polls go YouGov is one of the better ones, so let's go ahead and look at it before we dismiss it completely.

So next up is the methodology: 1,000 Americans. Not registered voters, not likely voters, not Republicans, not Democrats, not Iowans or Ohioans or Michiganders: Just 1,000 Americans that took an internet survey. No limits on likelihood of actual political participation or geographic location or political affiliation. This kills the survey.

But let's go ahead and look at the headline: Bernie Sanders much more competitive than media is reporting

Well, is he really? Considering that there's no willingness to separate Democrats from Republicans in the survey (or at least no indication they did so in the methodology) we can't be too sure, since if Republicans (who can't, generally speaking, vote in Democratic primaries) gave their opinion on the Democratic candidates, dislike Hillary Clinton to an extraordinary degree. (And indeed only 26% of survey participants self-described as ""liberal"" or ""very liberal"" whereas 36% of them self-described as ""conservative"" or ""very conservative"", so this poll already has a deep conservative slant.)

But I digress yet again. Is Bernie Sanders performing better than reported according this poll? The short answer is: **Nope**.

Bernie Sanders is polling at 15% in this YouGov poll. That is **exactly the same** as he polled in a poll from (a much more reliable and traditional pollster) Qunnipiac among almost 700 likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa that was also released today. It is also **5 points worse** than the UNH Granite state poll released Tuesday.

This poll is despite its many flaws _exactly_ representative of Sanders's draw in early primary states: 15-20% support  which is not onlt not enough to even begin to be competitive with Hillary Clinton; it's barely even enough to receive any delegates at the convention.

1149,"Yeah I'm not expecting you to clarify each time that you just mean the corrupt ones - that'd be unreasonable. I guess I'll just use Reddit to share the other side of the story.

I started ~6 months ago age 22 as a graduate, so let's assume that's the earliest age to join the industry. So no banker under 29 was working during the crash, and no-one under at the very least 35 (but more realistically 40+) could've had any impact in the decision-making for it. Given the pyramid structures of these firms, that represents the vast majority of the employees in the industry.

Imagine you decided to push yourself at arguably the most competitive and meritocratic industry on earth - often working from 7.30am-1am. But everyone thinks it's okay to casually/dismissively badmouth you/your profession - in fact people are commended for it.

I'm not going to say that it actually bothers me a great deal, but it creates a bit of an us-and-them thing.

And that's without mentioning that it's already pretty much the most-regulated industry around, that the reason banks become too big to fail is because they provide so much benefit to everything around them that they become relied-upon, and that the sub-prime crash was caused not only by banks being willing to lend to homeowners and securitise mortgages, but also by the government promising better-than-expected housing for everyone (and altering regulation/monetary policy to encourage that) and homeowners for borrowing more than they could re-pay and in the process making poor choices for themselves. Everyone played their part and acted on their incentives, as you'd expect them to, and no-one saw it coming. And people say that banks weren't affected by it, which is just not true. Of the 11 bulge brackets, Lehman went under, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got acquired, and Nomura, Paribas &amp; UBS in particular have had tonnes of issues since (really bad issues). I'm from Britain and the banks here are equally fucked - RBS just lost 446m *in a quarter*, and 4 of the biggest 5 are currently being valued at under the value of their assets by the market (so there's actually a negative amount of value within the intangibles of the firms). Here the government bailed out Lloyds and RBS, but the shares are being trickled back out into the public, % by %, and the taxpayer is being repaid. It wasn't just a bunch of free money.

No-one on here would ever trust the opinion of an investment banker on these issues because we're biased, but we do know the most about this stuff. We understand that the reason these firms earn a lot of money is because they provide valuable services which add to the economy, not because they trick people and bet on a zero-sum gain. I can tell you from experience that the amount of regulatory hoops we already have to jump through is *insane*. We sell some retail products through independent financial advisers (not allowed to sell directly to the public) - and it's our responsibility to check that the IFAs are selling the products correctly, to the right profiles of clients and with the right explanations (we literally have to monitor the ages, wealths and investment experiences of all our retail clients and cut off business with IFAs if they're selling to too many of the wrong people. My desk alone has ~200,000 individual clients). It's not the investor's responsibility, it's not the IFA's, it's not the regulator's - it's ours. That actually takes a huge amount of work. Most firms make profit by being efficient and not spending employee time doing analysis that isn't completely necessary - stuff like this sticks out like a big red flag in relation to the firm's normal operations.

A lot of the existing regulation is doing its job well. My feeling is that some of it will be pushed back - not expanded as Reddit seems to think - but that's neither here nor there. The point is that bills like the one Bernie Sanders is introducing come from people who have no understanding of what is a fairly complex system, and would destroy billions in GDP overnight.

Reddit seems to want lots of small institutions like credit unions to take retail deposits and invest them in risk-free assets. Has everyone forgotten that there was a huge crash when we tried that as well (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis)? The reason that financial systems keep fucking up is the same reason that people keep trying to innovate them and do new things with them - it's a huge gain to everyone when we get it right, so a lot of time/money is spent trying to perfect them. If you're unsure what I'm talking about - the primary function of investment banks is to facilitate capital markets, which, through debt and equity, allow firms to finance their activities. An efficient/competitive market (where investors are incentivised to pick the places where their money will get the best returns) encourages the money to be allocated to the companies that can use it to create the most GDP (and at the same time reward their investors). This means that the limited supply of money in the world is put to use in the companies who have compelling plans to use that money to grow and improve their business, which is a massive shot to the veins of the economy.

Ignoring all of that, willfully misunderstanding the industry and demonising the people who work in it (who statistically probably had nothing to do with the crash and who work frankly ridiculous hours, creating GDP for the economy in doing so) is just not going to get anyone anywhere. Reddit should understand this.

There was a [Quinnipiac University poll released a poll of likely Democratic Iowa Caucus goers today](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/ia/ia05072015_Igrwf25.pdf) (links to .pdf) that has some interesting data in it.

It won't be anymore if we can get Bernie Sanders elected. Here's his platform:

&gt;**Income and wealth inequality:** In the United States today we have the most unequal wealth and income distribution of any major country on earth -- worse than at any time since the 1920s. This is an economy that must be changed in fundamental ways. 
&gt;
&gt;**Jobs and income:** In my view, we need a massive federal jobs program which puts millions of our people back to work. We must end our disastrous trade policies. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And we have to fight for pay equity for women. 
&gt;
&gt;**Campaign finance reform:** As a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, American democracy is being undermined by the ability of the Koch brothers and other billionaire families. These wealthy contributors can literally buy politicians and elections by spending hundreds of millions of dollars in support of the candidates of their choice. We need to overturn Citizens United and move toward public funding of elections so that all candidates can run for office without being beholden to the wealthy and powerful. 
&gt;
&gt;**Climate change:** Climate change is real, caused by human activity and already devastating our nation and planet. The United States must lead the world in combating climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainability. 
&gt;
&gt;**College affordability:** Every person in this country who has the desire and ability should be able to get all the education they need regardless of the income of their family. This is not a radical idea. In Germany, Scandinavia and many other countries, higher education is either free or very inexpensive. We must do the same. 
&gt;
&gt;**Health care:** Shamefully, the United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. The United States must move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Health care is a right, not a privilege. 
&gt;
&gt;**Poverty:** The United States has more people living in poverty than at almost any time in the modern history of our country. I believe that in a democratic, civilized society none of our people should be hungry or living in desperation. We need to expand Social Security, not cut it. We need to increase funding for nutrition programs, not cut them. 
&gt;

The idea is, those that turn out to vote for him will also vote for a Congress that will support him and help him apply pressure to them after he is elected to get things passed.

1169,"That's some really pretty rhetoric.

Let's boil some of that off and get to the core of the issue-

Yes. A democrat will likely add justices to the court that will, if prompted, possibly reverse Citizens United.

But, doing that judicially will take years, as first the balance of the court must change, and since that requires death or retirement that might take years in and of itself, and then it requires a party with standing to sue for redress, and that case must go through all levels of the judicial branch, again, incurring a long wait for any change to happen. 

That is the most inefficient way to accomplish that goal I think you can manage. The quickest way is to pass a law that makes the ruling irrelevant. And that requires people to do more than vote for Bernie Sanders, or any Democrat, for President. 

Electing him doesn't fix that in any kind of timely fashion, and there are quite a few elections that money will rot before any kind of progress can happen through the SCOTUS. It's not practical to use that as a reason to make that choice. 

&gt;  Ultimately leading to unlimited campaign spending helping a Republican sweep of the rest of the states needed for a constitutional convention to rewrite the constitution in the grain of extreme right wing Republican corporatist oligarchic views. 

That verges on conspiracy theory thinking. Not that the GOP isn't thinking of making lots of money and shaping American society so that they can keep doing that, but there's no reason for them to try to create a constitutional convention to achieve that. There are fringe elements who think that's a solution, but if you really look you'll mostly find they're railing on social issues like abortion or gay marriage, not ensconcing some oligarchic language into it. The system already gives them pretty much all the tools they need to accomplish their goals, so that hasn't been the issue for the last 30 years. The top 1% didn't get to have so much of the money because their strategies have been failing. 

&gt; Where as Bernie Sanders would not stop until Citizens United is overturned.

Stop doing what? Talking? As President he has no power to change it, except to wait for a retirement or death and hope the person he selects, *if* he can get them confirmed, *might* revisit the ruling, and only if there's a chance to do so.

The GOP congress will shrug off any calls to pass a law, simply because they can. The Democrats can hate the ruling all they like, but they don't hate the campaign money it allows them access to, so their resistance will be weak, at best. 

You math doesn't figure. No amount of adding Bernie Sanders to the equation moves the needle when it comes to this issue. He's more effective, as a matter of fact, exactly where he is, if that's your intent.

2) America already is running massive deficits to cover the expenses, but to be honest I don't know exactly which program is running a deficit, but e.g. the [social security trust funds](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/oact/progdata/fundFAQ.html#a0=7) will be depleted within the next 20 years in two out of three possible scenarios, in the third the trusts will remain solvent over the next 75 years.

&gt;[B]efore liberal Democrats flock to Sanders, they should remember that the Vermont senator stands firmly to Clintons right on one issue of overwhelming importance to the Democratic base: gun control. During his time in Congress, Sanders opposed several moderate gun control bills. He also supported the most odious NRAbacked law in recent memory  one that may block Sandy Hook families from winning a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the gun used to massacre their children.

&gt;Sanders, an economic populist and middle-class pugilist, doesnt talk much about guns on the campaign trail. But his voting record paints the picture of a legislator who is both skeptical of gun control and invested in the interests of gun owners  and manufacturers. In 1993, voted against the Brady Act, which mandated federal background checks for gun purchasers and restricted felons access to firearms. As a senator, Sanders supported bills to allow firearms in checked bags on Amtrak trains and block funding to any foreign aid organization that registered or taxed Americans guns.

Now shut up and go donate to Sanders.

*Especially* implies that the following is not *always* the case- **revolution** *can* happen *gradually* and without violence.

Here we see commas separating the defining words... note that *sudden* and *marked change* are within a comma separated list... **Revolution** can be *steady* and ends in *change*

Like, 1 bill enacted that wasn't naming buildings? Out of 319? That's just pretty sad. I understand it's about starting discussion but I expect more results than 1/319.

1278,"So, I'd be way more concerned about the overly-broad derivatives provision than breaking banks up into smaller pieces.

 Lots of very different things are derivatives: futures are not much like swaps which aren't much like forwards and none of those are anything like options. Their only unifying characteristic is that a derivative is a contract for a (possibly contingent) claim on some asset of some kind. 

Even within those categories, different derivatives have wildly different risk-return characteristics -- and depending on which ""side"" of the trade the bank is on, many of them actually reduce the bank's overall risk of failure. Buying options: maybe costly, but risk-reducing. Selling options: probably lucrative, risk-increasing. Selling and buying ""matched"" options at a slightly different prices (selling to a counterparty that wants to get rid of risk, and buying from a counterparty that wants to take it on): slightly profitable, risk-neutral, and exactly an investment bank's job. This legislation does not differentiate at all among these scenarios, and that's a major problem. It gives the (accurate or not) impression that its author doesn't understand what derivatives are or how they work. 

Even sticking to the most traditional, vanilla, ""boring"" conception of what banks are supposed to do: they borrow short-term from depositors (and money market mutual funds, etc) to make longer term, risky loans like mortgages, car loans, commercial business loans, etc. When they do this, they're bearing two kinds of risk:

1. Credit Risk: the risk that the person money is being loaned to will default on their loan.

2. Interest Rate Risk: the risk that changes in credit-risk-free interest rates (primarily long-term rates going up unexpectedly) will make the payments from the loans they've already made worth less in present value. 

Credit risk isn't much of a problem if defaults are independent across borrowers -- if each borrower's likelihood of defaulting is unrelated to whether any other borrower defaults, then as long as you have enough borrowers and charge them at least the Treasury rate for the same term plus their probability of default, you should be fine. 

In real life, though, they're correlated: there are lots of conceivable things that can cause lots of people to default at once, and those tends to happen at the least convenient time possible. Because this kind of risk is difficult or impossible to ""diversify away"", whoever bears that risk earns a ""risk premium"" for bearing it. This is on the order of maybe 1-2% or so (above the raw probability plus treasury, or 'actuarially fair' rate) under normal conditions. 

If we really want banks to be less risky (and less profitable under normal conditions), then it would make sense to let them **buy** contracts from investors or reinsurers that would pay them if lots of borrowers default at once. That way, the bank's less likely to fail, and the people bearing the risk of losing money in events that would cause the bank to fail are earning enough for that risk (and have enough already) that it's hard to feel bad for them. That's efficient: the systemic default risk and the normal reward that goes  with bearing it go to whatever rich guy or mutual fund is willing to take it for the lowest return, and they're almost surely less systemically important to the rest of the economy than the bank is. **As long as everyone involved knows what they're getting** and giving away when they buy or sell it, everyone is better off. There's nothing wrong with investors bearing this risk (someone needs to do it if credit's going to be available to borrowers at all) and nothing wrong with the fact that bearing it is generally profitable.

That last ""as long as"" is actually really important. A particular subset of contracts like these (not all of them) contributed to the 2008 crisis because they were deliberately mislabeled to hide how risky they were, and in particular their systemic risk (the probability of lots of people not just defaulting but doing it all at once) was mismodeled (sometimes deliberately and fraudulently by people who knew what was going on, and sometimes mistakenly by people who didn't know better but probably should have). So it's not that reform and regulation isn't needed -- it's absolutely critical that contracts like this be constructed transparently enough that everyone in the transaction knows what they're getting and doesn't take on more of that systematic credit risk than they should realistically be able to bear. But if enacted, the bill Sanders filed would also ban banks from using much clearer derivatives to protect depositors' money (er...to prevent the bank from failing so that the depositors have to go get their money back from the FDIC). It's a really blunt instrument that would completely disallow a broad set of tools, many of which have lots of perfectly legitimate uses. 

Banks also use different kinds of derivatives (e.g., futures on Treasury rates/bonds) to mitigate their interest rate risk in a similar way (they pay a risk premium to some investor who's willing to take it). Those present much less potential for systemic risk than credit-default-linked derivatives and have never been controversial until people started saying ""ban ALL the derivatives!!1!"" recently. 

Regarding size / breakups / too big to fail: 

I don't care about this as much. Big banks are almost certainly less risky than medium sized banks because they can be more diversified in terms of borrower mix. But it's not clear that HUGE banks are any better this way than merely big banks, and maybe some of them should be broken up. I do think breakup advocates vastly overstate the extent of ""monopoly power"" from the current huge banks, especially if we include large banks headquartered outside the US that do a lot of business here (I didn't see Deutchebank or HSBC on Sanders's list...). It's not like clients of investment banks don't have twenty to choose from. It also might make regulation and monitoring harder, rather than easier, to split the existing huge firms into twice as many merely big ones. On the other hand, it's possible breaking them up would mitigate systemic risk enough to be worth any extra oversight costs. **I don't know what the answer to this is, and it's an important question. But if Bernie Sanders can't tell an exchange-traded rate future from an OTC swap, then I definitely don't think he's the person to answer it.**

**TL/DR:** It's things like this that make me dislike Sanders and Warren. When they talk about issues like this and call for regulations, they make it sound like they have little or no understanding of how even a healthy banking/financial system is supposed to work. It's not that I feel bad for the banks; they're doing fine and on balance we really should be harder on them. We certainly need more transparency and oversight. But the details are really, really important. Replacing ""hail the banks!"" with ""f*ck the banks! And stop them from taking RISKS and using spooky derivatives!""  doesn't really help. More like a  clumsy step too far in the right direction.",1,0.0805420790793,0.151024511092,0.470317395371,0.2656670401,0.669791666667,1.0,1225,0.0639686684073,25.0,0.05,0.05

Having a shit ton of money is actually a problem in our current system of government. You can't have companies able to donate or buy politicians at such magnitude. With enough money you can buy both sides.  Bernie Sanders is running today specifically stating that this is one of the reasons. Citizens United is taking away democracy and giving us Oligarchy. Banks that are too big to fail are the top of this oligarchy and the fact that the laws work in their favor is direct evidence of this. The fact that a crash as bad as 2008 could happen and everyone at the top got away Scott free is evidence.

1290,"I've not been around as long as McGovern and Mondale but I have been around for more than a few primary fights. The key aspect that people for sanders seem to keep forgetting is that party leadership makes a huge difference. There seems to be a misconception about Obama's run in 2008, he basically had a perfect storm of good speaking, surprise challenging, debate skills, and most importantly endorsements and even with all of this it was an incredibly close race. Obama began effectively courting super delegates in 2004 when he gave the keynote at the convention, from there he used Dick Durbin to establish connections within the party. Super delegates matter. A lot. They count towards overall delegate count and their endorsements can make or break a candidate. They campaign for you and usually have a following that brings votes, Obama actually beat Clinton in super delegates and that was a Huge determine factor of him winning. Sanders doesn't have any of that built in, he's from a small state with little connections, and has been running as an independent his whole life, sometimes even against democratic candidates. A lot of party faithful will be wary of that. 

I use Obama as the example because really there's hardly anyone to compare Hillary to, she's been so well established its crazy and just added Secretary of State to her resume and I think she's learned from her failed run in 2008. Plus She has the power of using one of the most popular figures in the party, if not the most popular figure in the party with bill Clinton. It puts her in a unique position. She's extremely well established, currently well liked in the party with a variety of experience and a huge secret weapon campaigning. Obama negating bill a little by getting maybe the most well liked woman in America on Oprah to campaign for him in 2008 in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Bernie doesn't really have that help, even the biggest name that would most likely agree with him, Elizabeth Warren, seems to be tepidly supporting Clinton probably looking to run in 4-8 years herself. Now Maybe you could argue Robert Kennedy in 1968 challenging the sitting Vice President but he had the Kennedy name and even before the assassination he was trailing and likely to never catch him in delegates. 

Overall I think it's great a lot of people are excited about sanders but party politics is tough, and the general can be even harder. I don't see Obama's unlikely win in sanders. He has a lot of things working against him and a lot of problems in terms of electability to compound those problems. There have been similar candidates (kuchinic, I know people hate the comparison but Ron Paul for the republicans, etc) and they have faced the same hurdles in the past without much result, I'm not optimistic about his chances but everyone has the right to campaign and donate and speak in favor of a candidate I just hope people take a step back and be realistic about the situation. If they end up disengaged because Clinton wins or wins big I am afraid of the progressive base of the party not showing up to vote as is needed in the general. There seems to be a resentment about her, which granted I know for progressives she's hardly a perfect candidate but she's also a lot better than a republican. Having a republican president could be disastrous for the Supreme Court. There are currently about 4 justices at or approaching retirement age. Ginsberg, Kennedy, Breyer and Scalia. Two of those are liberals, one is a swing vote and one is a conservative. If any one of the first three leave with a republican president then the court shifts from a split court like we currently have to a solidly conservative court, and the other justices are young in comparison.

What I think is that if you took a look at his Senate record, you knew he supported these things all along, and that he's not compromising. He's always been and has governed as a Third Way Clintonian.

To clear up the Gitmo misconception, Obama's plan was actually regressive. It stripped detainees of more rights, and the ACLU opposed it. Warren and Sanders actually both voted against it too.

I personally think she'd be much better, even though I'm not sold to her 100%. There are still positions of hers I'd like to know. I'm by far convinced Sanders would be many times better than Obama.

----------------------------------

Using the Obama primary campaign as a comparison, what is the likelihood of Sanders' campaign against Clinton succeeding? [Here's the wiki of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates) all Primary polls conducted in the run-up to the 2008 primary.

The following is the polling data from May 4th of 2007 (essentially the same place in the campaign we are now), including the top 4 candidates:

* **CNN/Opinion Research Poll** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 24%, Al Gore 12%, John Edwards 12%, 

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (with Gore)** - Hillary Clinton 38%, Barack Obama 23%, Al Gore 14%, John Edwards 12%, Unsure 4%

* **USA Today/Gallup Poll (without Gore)** Hillary Clinton 45%, Barack Obama 27%, John Edwards 14%, Unsure/None 5%

Now, compare this too the the most recent polling from this election cycle ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries)):

* **The Economist** - Hillary Clinton 59%, Bernie Sanders 10% 

* **Fox News** - Hillary Clinton 62%, Bernie Sanders 4%   

* **Quinnipiac University** - Hillary Clinton 60%, Bernie Sanders 8%, 

* **CNN** - Hillary Clinton 69%, Bernie Sanders 5%

So, what conclusions can we draw from this data? Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is starting off from a MUCH more dominant position. The difference between 40% and 63% is night and day. It's hard to describe how different this is without going into the subject too much (and this post is already a novella), but it's an insanely large difference.

Secondly, Sanders is polling SIGNIFICANTLY worse than Obama was at this time. Obama was polling at 25% and was the consensus ""not-Hillary"" pick by this point. Basically in 2008, Hillary's level of support stayed fairly flat at around 45% and Obama picked off all the stragglers and slowly gained until he won. Here, if Hillary remains ""flat"" she'll win the primary in a landslide. So in order for Sanders to win, he'll have sway away over a third of the Hillary supporters (which are going to be the more moderate Dems anyway). 

Additionally, the ""not Hillary / Bernie"" voters are actually Warren supporters (instead of Gore/Edwards). Warren has about as much support as Sanders right now (between 5%-10% in polls where she's included). And while the natural instinct may be to assume many of those supporters will eventually flock to Sanders, Hillary is doing everything she can to prevent this. She's [actively shaping her campaign so as to position herself as a toned down Warren](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren/). 

If I had to guess, she saw how her decision to stay moderate during the primary cost her the '08 bid and is trying to position herself as essentially ""Warren Lite"". This actually seems like a winning strategy and should certainly help stem the tide re: Sanders and prevent him from picking up steam.

So where does that leave us? (with the tl;dr I suppose)

-----------------------

**TL;DR:** The polls suggest that this is a VERY different situation from last election. While Obama ""only"" had to sway the undecided voters to win the nomination, in order for Sanders to win, he'll have to do that AND convert over a third of the Clinton supports to his side. This may be difficult because (1) her supporters are typically the more moderate voters, (2) she's doing a better job positioning herself as the ""populist"" candidate than she did in 2008, and (3) Sanders does not appeal well to moderates compared to Obama and even Obama couldn't chip away at her initial polling numbers.

[Note, this is just looking at national data, state-by-state polling is both more useful and telling - although in [Iowa](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary), [New Hampshire](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html), and [New York](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_democratic_presidential_primary-4221.html) (the states with the first 3 primaries) the story looks to be about the same, with Clinton leading with over 50% of the vote.]


-------------------

Now, as has [been correctly pointed out in each of the two times I've posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34jsmu/bernie_sanders_raises_15_million_in_24_hours_says/cqw26xs), Obama entered the primary in February, so by now he'd already been campaigning for some time. However, when you go back to the February data, the picture just gets more damning. 

Lets look at the data back in mid-Feb. There were two polls 2 days after Obama announced:

** Poll 1**

* Clinton 37% - Obama 17%, 

** Poll 2**

* Clinton 28%, Obama 24%

So this actually paints an even bleaker picture for Sanders. Coming into the race, Obama and Clinton were polling neck and neck in one poll and were relatively close in the other. Sanders is down by like 50 points in all of the polls from early May when he announced.

#In Conclusion:

The polling data would suggest that Sanders is going to have a much harder time (than Obama) dismantling the ""presumptive nominee"" Hillary Clinton.

You're making an assumption that we can't know yet: that he cannot gain votes from the opposing team.  I certainly have no way to prove it will happen on a wide scale, but among the people I know, Sanders has a surprisingly high appeal among republicans.  Probably because their field is so laughably weak and the republican leadership has been an embarrassment to them.

So I still think the poll numbers you keep going back to aren't able to give us a complete picture.

I'd be surprised if they did that.  The blowback from upsetting the younger voters who've embraced Sanders this early would be extremely painful in the general.

So far, Sanders has a pretty strong populist approach and that's going to net him some growing appeal as the cycle moves forward. Hillary's already hamstrung by hate from her husband, the whole ""Benghazi"" affair (which, believe it or not hasn't been ""settled"" at all to the satisfaction of a large number of people) - and she'd be perhaps one of the easiest candidates to target for devastating smear campaigns in the light of the Clinton foundations financial higglety-piggleties.

Looking at it Obama was much better positioned than sanders so much so it's far off to even compare the paths they had/have, the only thing revolutionary with sanders its virally backed very early where Obama tapped into social media a little later but to a much bigger degree. Obama used a grassroots campaign but he compounded it with an effective strategy to win the primary with endorsements and big name support. Sanders has almost no super delegate support at the moment, Obama had been working on his essentially since 2004 when he did the keynote and connected with long time party insiders dick Durbin, deveal Patrick among others to essential wreck Clinton's party by overwhelmingly taking super delegates, most notably Ted Kennedy who might have been so important it won him the whole damn thing. On top of that Obama started with Oprah campaigning, which was huge and had an extensive network of community organizers and training in community organizing to win Iowa and gain momentum from there, then bill clinton's gaffe in South Carolina which helped turn out even more African American voters made him dominate South Carolina. 

Obama started out stronger, caught Clinton by surprise and have a clear plan set in place to win the nomination with years of back work and it BARELY worked out for him. That's not to even mention he was a once in a political generation speaker and excellent debater with a clear concise message. Sanders has a nice message but isn't a great orator, doesn't have any democratic connections (he's not even been in the party, he's ran against democrats his support by the brass of the party is very small) and many other factors on top of how hard it was to beat Clinton the first time, most likely harder this time now she's taking the primary serious from the beginning and essentially paid her dues to the party elite means sanders has a very small chance of pulling anything off. He's improved but not polling as well as Obama when he started off and his fundraising numbers look nice now but over the scope of what the primary and general will cost isn't all that important yet, especially with the fundraising power that Clinton has.

The only way I could see it happening is if halfway through the primaries Hillary had some health emergency and was forced to drop out.  Even then, I wouldn't bet on it because the Democratic party establishment would enter panic mode and pull whatever shenanigans necessary to pick someone else as nominee.

As much as Reddit loves this guy, and don't get me wrong I like him too, he is not electable in our current political climate.  A not insignificant portion of the population honestly believes everything Obama does is some sort of secret communist plot to subvert the constitution and declare martial law. They believe this about Obama, whose actions as president could barely even be characterized as moderate.  How would they react to someone who openly declares himself a democratic socialist?  No amount of reasoning and explaining will convince them that he is not Lenin reborn.  

What Sanders run can do though is provide a platform for expressing actual progressive ideas and actually fight for them rather than apologize for them.  This is a fight that needs to happen for there to be any chance of moving the political discourse back towards the realm of sanity where in the future a person like Sanders will have an actual chance.

Honestly, I'm not sure I would even want Sanders to win the nomination this year.  People are quick to forget history.  McGovern in 1972 comes to mind.  He was the Liberal wet dream.  He had helped reform the democratic nomination system so that the nominee was chosen by the primary voters instead of democratic party bosses.  Then he ran a powerful grass roots campaign to win the nomination in the face of huge establishment opposition within his own party.  After winning the nomination he received little support from much of that establishment and outright opposition from some of it.  He then went on to lose 49 of 50 states in the general election and lost the popular vote by 23 points making Richard Nixon president again.

I'm not saying people shouldn't vote for Sanders.  I hope they will and in large numbers.  But if we want real change in the Democratic party and country as a whole I believe we would be better served by him coming in a strong second for the nomination than winning it.

Further, with both parents now often at work, most working-class families cant locate the high-quality and affordable child care they need for their kids. Quality education in America, from child care to higher education, must be affordable for all. Without a high-quality and affordable educational system, we will be unable to compete globally and our standard of living will continue to decline.

Some European countries are even built on these political ideologies, most notably the Nordic nations. Countries like Norway are built so much on this ideology that they can be described as social democracies. 

What he is asking for is not crazy. It's not even new. He's not asking to go beyond Norway. He's not asking to even be Norway. He's quite modest in his goals if looked at through the prism of a social democrat. He just wants a considerably move in that direction, and America is so far away from such a point that it seems crazy to some people. 

I think it's important to emphasize this point, because what Ron Paul was asking has never been seen in the modern world before. Ron Paul really was advocating for something completely new. We know what Bernie Sanders is asking for. Much more extreme versions exist today than what he is asking for. 

Now of course I'm describing this somewhat objectively. I don't think such rationale will fly in American politics anytime soon. I do think it's important for people to understand the distinction though. Social democracies do exist today, and they do function with a good degree of success.

Whether he can actually do it without the support of the house and senate is a different matter. Getting Bernie in is showing the politicians what the people want. They need to follow by Repainting both houses.

One of my greater concerns isn't that Bernie isn't a great candidate, it's that even if he does get elected, people will grow impatient with his inability to effect change as they continue to support sitting representatives and senators. If there's one thing I hope he does is to push for strong electoral changes including term limits in both houses.

1376,"Populism is not on the political spectrum, it just depends on how and why you appeal to the electorate.

Generally, it means adopting policies not because they are good, but because they are popular, adopting policies that are seen as challenging elites or the establishment, relying on grassroots support, often populism embodies short term thinking at the expense of long term goals or big picture ideals.

Sometimes populism is very successful, other times it attracts only a vocal minority, and it can also fall flat on its face of the electorate is actually smarter or more pragmatic than the populist candidate counts on. For example, a candidate might run on the idea of a deep tax cut that everyone loves, but the electorate realizes that such a tax cut will lead to lower defence spending and severely weaken the country so they might think twice when they pull closed the curtain at the polling station.

Both Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders are populists, they just both come at it from opposite angles. Ron Paul's ""end the fed"" and Bernie Sanders's ""too big to exist"" are both populist policies. In the case of Ron Paul, he wants to shut down the federal reserve and completely privatize US monetary policy. In the case of Bernie Sanders, he wants to break up the ""too big to fail"" banks. Both appeal to a mass audience who either see the elites in government controlling monetary policy and messing up the country, or see the elites controlling the big banks and screwing up the economy.

As long as you either don't pay (or don't account for paying) the higher monthly payments which come from higher contributions. He's taking projected costs under the current system and saying ""see, we just need to raise the cap and we can cover those costs"". And what's sad is that he knows that he's leaving information out (about either the costs or the massive shift from Social Security as a repayment to social security as welfare), but knows most people won't notice it.

And none of that brings in enough revenue to make Medicare solvent without major changes to Medicare.

1400,"&gt;Do you really think minority voters would have huge turnout for an old white guy?

In my opinion, not at all.  COntrary to the reddit hivemind, I don't think Sanders has any significance chance to win the election.  He does have a role to play to bring up some economic issues, influence the conversation, and provide a foil to challenge Hillary from the left.  He will help Hillary in some respect by presenting a challenge, but may also push her to the left. 

I don't think Sanders could get turnout, so the answer to that part of your question is no. However, the more disturbing question is whether Hillary can turnout. 

I don't do campaign politics myself, I do have a number of friends that do work on campaigns.   They see get out the vote efforts as professional, but the disturbing question is whether Hillary can inspire people to turn out and vote.

1403,"I subscribe to his YouTube channel, but it seems like much more of a platform for posting his media appearances to me. That's great and everything, and good for people who want to see him actually working away. 

He's got until next January before the actual voting starts to select a winner. That is more than enough time to carefully craft a plan to get way out ahead of Clinton and the rest of the pack in the digital age. He should make something like a 12 Step Program-style video series detailing the 12 largest macro issues currently facing American and conquer each on in a separate video. America needs to look in the mirror and make some choices. They need to grow up a little bit. Bernie Sanders talks the talk, and his campaign staff need to run what might be the most productive (per dollar spent) campaign that we've seen in a very long time. The easiest way to do that is create well-produced YouTube videos that follow a simple formula.

1) Confront issue right away. Make it specific and targeted, but meaningful. Something like how the American people line up like ducks in a row to vote for Hilary Clinton without even hearing a peep from her on specific policy while she's already raking in six figure donations from the people who put people on the streets in 2008 and beyond. Bring up the fact that likely millions of Americans feel lost and disenfranchised with their government, lives, and financial stability. No single person in the ""greatest country in the world"" should be crying themselves to sleep at night because they can't pay the rent even after working two or more jobs. The ""Greatest Country in the World"" should not be destroying nation states around the world in the name of freedom. Supporting rebel groups/governments in countries that leaned towards communism during the Cold War appears to have had devastating consequences globally ever since. What is a single person going to do with a salary of 80 million dollars, for example? They might give a lot of that money away to causes they support, but why have the middleman if they're supporting programs like the Salvation Army or the United Way? Why not redistribute that money and subsidize the poorest of the poor to get them off the streets? It's complex, but it should be confronted more. I could go on but there's more than enough material to get started.

2) Give concrete evidence. Just like in the video, show *concrete* evidence that proves your point. Prove that things are completely fucked to the least intelligent of Americans. Open up their eyes to what's going on when they pay their taxes, or buy cheap shit at Wal-Mart because they can't afford goods from more ethical, high-quality stores. Open their eyes to just how much money so few people have. Maybe Bernie doesn't have that kind of charisma to make it that simple, but at the very least he has to get that ball rolling with a larger group of Americans.

3) Provide a solution. Give us some good policy early. Explain what you would do and be a specific as humanly possible at this point.

4) Carefully and easily explain how your policy will make things better. Try to anticipate what your opponents will try to spin you as, but assure the audience to make no mistake. You're here to play ball, and you're here to help level the playing field back to a more... sane state.

Tl;Dr: I agree. He's blowing up on SM, but he has to actually capitalize on it. He needs original content. Give us a State of the Union. Give us a Gettysberg Address. Blow away the American public with video after video every few weeks of the abhorrent problems plaguing the United States. Media appearances are great to have online, but that should only be 25% of his content or so. If he starts now, he'll be light years ahead of Clinton et al. come 2016. He will have mobilized an enormous group of youths and young professionals and likely alienated a small portion of voters, but that doesn't matter. He needs to re-invigorate this generation if anything at all. He can do that by using YouTube to it's full political potential.",2,0.109712301587,0.204999875343,0.470161564626,0.25432241419,0.9,0.875,739,0.0302325581395,16.4222222222,0.111666666667,0.373333333333
1404,"&gt; And either pay out a lot more money to people who contributed above the $108k or screw anyone who did.
&gt; Which will Sanders do?

I thought I'd sort of addressed that, but I didn't.

The thinking goes that the higher income earners would be propping up (so to speak) the Social Security program. This is really nothing new, since the more you earn, the more you pay in pretty much every other category of taxes. The social safety net (of which Sanders is the biggest proponent) is always paid by the people who don't need it, for obvious reasons.

It's ""controversial"" because it's effectively a tax increase and fiscal conservatives hate that. People will argue that it's a tax and that they get nothing out of it (which may or may not be true).

Others would argue that $108k is midlle to lower middle class in some places in a single earner household (which can be true).

Others will argue that this doesn't really hit the wealthiest because their money is all dividends, capital gains, etc (which is true).

If Sanders had his way, the cap would be removed, it would probably apply to capital gains, and the program would be means tested so that wealthy people get a small fraction of what the program pays out (or nothing).

Whether he could accomplish *any* of that is a different story, but it's what he has said for a pretty long time.

It's crazy to think that just removing the cap fixes social security immediately, though.",2,0.129664502165,0.161401094553,0.478127705628,0.268942150223,0.633333333333,0.883333333333,266,0.0347222222222,20.4615384615,0.0111111111111,0.188888888889

1410,"&gt; Both you and the article have been saying that she mixed state and federal taxes in her claim, but then you go on to say she's only taking about state taxes

Yes, she mixed them. Her point was that undocumented immigrants pay taxes. She points to an article by Albor Ruiz titled [""Corporate giants often get huge tax breaks, while poor, undocumented immigrants have paid billions in state taxes.""](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/corporate-giants-subsidized-undocumented-workers-article-1.2188061) Full stop. This is where she is purporting to get her information. 

So, let's take a look at that article. It references a report from the [Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy.](http://www.itep.org/pdf/undocumentedtaxes2015.pdf)

The title of that report is ""Undocumented Immigrants' State and Local Tax Contributions.""

Ruiz then compares that report and its findings to the website of Senator Sanders. That page is titled ""Top 10 Corporate Tax Avoiders"" and only purports to show that large corporations are not paying their fair share of **Federal Taxes.**

She mixed them, either intentionally or not. Either way, the mixture causes her statement to be false.

&gt;Then there's the fact that nothing in the article links to an exclusive list of companies at play. 

Doesn't have to be. Clinton pointed to the website of Senator Sanders to point out the corporations that aren't paying taxes. Given that she's already couched her statement to specifically call out **New York** corporations, it doesn't make much sense to look at corporations that are not New York corporations, does it? One might call that cherrypicking to use data that is outside the scope.

Here's the tl;dr of the Post fact checking:

* Clinton statement: ""Undocumented immigrants pay more taxes in New York than some New York corporations.""
* Post: *I wonder where she got that information.*
* Clinton team: We used this article by Albor Ruiz
* Post: Well, that article talks about the State and Local taxes that immigrants pay.

Even before Obama had declared, there wasn't a feeling that Hillary was the *only* choice - there were plenty of ""not-Hillary"" picks available in the field of candidates to siphon off her polling numbers.

This time around, especially with everyone focusing so much on the will/won't Warren declare question, and her repeated insistence that she won't, there's been a general feeling that Hillary is basically it, and that contributes significantly to her polling numbers.

1431,"So [here's the results](http://imgur.com/a/9vXxV) of the GW Battleground poll of 1,000 Registered voters. It's a little bit easier to read visually like this (I feel) and draw your own conclusions.

I am disappointed in one big thing with this survey: I'm not the biggest Sanders fan in the world and I don't think he's got a chance in hell against HRC, but at the same time every poll in the last several weeks points to him as Hillary's (and I use this word loosely) biggest competition. Yet he is not included on this survey. It's a pretty big miss.

That being said, it's a pretty decent indicator of what the issues will be this time around: The Economy (23%), Jobs (14%) and Foreign Threats (12%), with the GOP seen stronger on Foreign Affairs (50-40%), slightly stronger The Economy (49-45%) and Dems in favor on Jobs (49-42%), though it will be quite interesting to how the GOP field (who has no candidate with meaningful foreign policy experience) stacks up against the former Secretary of State when it comes to foreign affairs. The poll becomes even murkier because even though ""the economy"" is seen as a top issue that generically favors Republicans, many of the the actual bread-and-butter issues that need to be addressed (Creating jobs, increasing wages and benefits, reducing healthcare and education costs) are traditionally Democratic causes and only a handful of voters prefer traditionally Republican causes such as deficit reduction (13%), tax cuts (7%) and regulation reform (7%).

But as far as the current crop of candidates is concerned, it's probably more accurate to say that Hillary Clinton is the candidate voters hate the least than like the most. And if Scott Walker is going to run for President, he needs to get in sooner rather than later because 47% of those surveyed have no idea who he is. But of those who have heard of him, at 19% he's got some of the lowest unfavorables polled. He has the strongest opportunity for growth out of the entire GOP field (excluding Carly Fiorina who seems to be off the radar of 60% of registered voters).

This is also a good to borderline excellent poll for Marco Rubio because out of all GOP contenders, when it comes to the people who have actually heard of him, 42% would consider voting for him - better than all other GOP challengers. Considering his (relatively) soft unfavorables (50%), he is currently in the best spot for becoming the 2016 GOP nominee, though 26% of voters still have no idea who he is.

So to sum up, it's the economy, stupid, again. The public generally thinks the GOP is better at it until you actually ask them about what's wrong and then the Democrats become the slight favorite. Foreign policy is surprisingly relevant this year and while the GOP is favored here again, it'll be interesting to see a party lacking candidates with bona fide foeign policy experience to take on America's former top diplomat on the issue. Voters are generally split on Hillary Clinton and Scott Walker and Marco Rubio have some homework to do on getting their message out because they both (but especially Rubio) are probably the best possible challengers to Jeb Bush who is becoming increasingly (60%!) unpopular.",2,0.136637080868,0.265846531242,0.485936883629,0.297210889347,1.215,1.0,563,0.0655737704918,31.2777777778,-0.137820512821,0.218482905983

Well, the Democrats have their own issues in that regard. 

For example, the left's opposition to nuclear power has set us back quite a ways. 

Also, people who tend to oppose GMO foods tend to come from the left. 

This idea that Democrats care about science and the GOP doesn't is pretty silly. Both sides suffer from confirmation bias and will use scientific consensus only when it benefits their cause. 

For example, there is near universal consensus among economists that free trade is a smart economic policy. That doesn't stop this sub from circlejerking whenever Bernie Sanders spouts off with some inane anti free trade argument.

1435,"You're right, it certainly does. But politics isn't about votes, it's about influence. Votes are a measure by which we determine whether or not a bill has passed. We also need to consider the things that lead up to that vote. Filibusters, deals being made, speeches, and campaigns for public opinion are all attempts to spread or use influence to change the vote.

Look at Indiana. The vote count for RFRA was enough to pass, but the members of the political community of Indiana who opposed that bill shifted public opinion on the bill and used the influence that public opinion grants to create a massive outcry against the bill, ultimately ending in an amendment passing.

The thing about Warren and Sanders is that they are preaching views that a lot of liberals at this moment are really looking for, and so they gain an advantage in public opinion. That public opinion can then be used to both spread and use that influence to help oppose or support their efforts in the senate.

Also, Sanders winning the presidency would be huge for progressives.

Do you feel the same way about conservative forums?

Because Reddit is actually a much worse political forum.  The levels of groupthink are insanely bad here due to the nature of the voting system.  You get downvoted for the wrong wording, or for questioning ingrained beliefs too heavily.  The same talking points are repeated heavily, and everyone knows the counters to every Republican statistic but gets upvoted for repeating Democrat.

Simplest example: If you say ""43% of poor people don't even pay income tax, we need to tax poor people more"", everyone can *immediately* tell you how this statistic is a trick of numbers designed to make it look like poor people don't pay, because it's derived from federal income tax and excludes other taxes they do pay, and how the Republican party uses this statistic to manipulate it's voter base.

But if I say ""The largest corporations pay less than 4% in net effective income tax, we need to tax corporations more"", I'd be showered in upvotes.  Attempts to explain why this statistic is *just as false* and explanations of how it is derived receive downvotes.  Why?  *Because this statistic agrees with Reddit's pre-existing opinion*.  Because people upvote based on *beliefs*, specifically, anti-corporate and Democrat, rather than discussion.  This stifles any true discussion, because only opinions that agree with people's existing beliefs will rise to the top.  

(I actually had someone here tell me that while my explanation as to the falseness of that statistic made some sense, Bernie Sanders cited it, and he trusts Bernie Sanders over a random person on the internet when it comes to taxes.)

They end up paying much less in taxes.

In other words, it's a subsidy in the form of a tax write off.  It is legislation that directly benefits big oil companies and everybody else has to make up for that lost revenue.

What is the difference if its in the form of a written check or off of taxes?  The end result is the same: This legislation is Bernie supporting the government subsidizing big oil.  After this legislation the big oil companies would end up with less of the Federal Tax burden.

1463,"Subsidy has a specific definition for governmental entities: ""a sum of money granted by the government or a public body to assist an industry or business so that the price of a commodity or service may remain low or competitive.""

What Senator Sanders refers to are not subsidies.

1) Money is not being granted by the federal government (state governments in the article were in fact giving subsidies). Deductions are being taken at an earlier time than would be allowed otherwise without the specific oil and gas tax provisions. Total dollar amounts are unchanged, merely timing differences.

2) These tax breaks do not affect the price of the commodity. As I stated in a different comment, oil companies like Exxon do not control enough market share to alter the market price of oil.

So, yes, these federal tax provisions are beneficial to oil and gas companies, but they are not subsidizing them. 

I personally believe that many of the preferential items given to oil and gas companies should be removed like the immediate deduction of Intangible Drilling and Development Costs or the short term amortization of Geological and Geophysical surveying costs (both of which Senator Sanders' proposal eliminate).

However, some of the other provisions that Senator Sanders put forth in the bill that go too far and hurt oil companies as opposed to putting them on equal footing with the rest of the tax code. Additionally, several of the proposals that he puts forth do not affect large oil companies, which his bill claims are the targets of the piece of legislation (Percentage depletion and part of the IDC deduction).

&gt;A subsidy is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (or institution, business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economic and social policy.[1] Although commonly extended from Government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support - for example from NGOs or implicit subsidies. Subsidies come in various forms including: **direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect (tax breaks, insurance, low-interest loans, depreciation write-offs, rent rebates).[2][3]**

But you'll never get anywhere arguing semantics.

Why not argue based on the spirit and principle of the legislation, instead of the meaningless semantics?  Everybody else considers tax breaks subsidies.  If you and Mr. Sanders don't that's your guys decision to not adopt the same meaning everybody else uses.  

The legislation makes the tax burden less for the companies it is aimed it, and more for everybody else.  This creates more of a burden for the average American tax-payer that must make up for that lost revenue.  Bernie Sanders signed off on it.

So We'll reword it from: ""Bernie is for subsidizing big oil companies""

to: ""Bernie is in favor of giving big rich oil companies preferential treatment when it comes to how they pay taxes to the Federal Government""

&gt; she's estimated to raise $2.5 billion, mainly from banks

Proof? You seriously believe she'll raise at least $1.25 billion directly from banks? I find that extremely hard to believe. Her Senate campaign had a lot of donors from banks, but it was almost entirely from individuals who work there and not even from bank PACs. Which makes it mostly meaningless. I would be counted in that if I donated and am far from an anti-regulation, anti-rich people tax, corporate shill. The numbers from banks still weren't overwhelming compared to the total, [approx. 10%](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=n00000019&amp;type=I) which makes your ""mainly from banks"" comment even more unlikely and her whole PAC total was barely 1%. Individual contributions are 88%.

Either way, don't hate the player, hate the game. I hate the whole concept of these stupid Super PACs as much as anyone, but it's the only way anyone *including Sanders* will have a chance of winning when the other side will most definitely use them and every other dirty trick in the book to win. There's almost no chance Citizens United will be solved before the 2016 election, especially with a Republican majority in both houses. To expect one candidate to shoot themselves in the foot by not playing the game is unrealistic. If Clinton wins the primary, she still probably won't raise as much as her opponent in the general no matter what.

I'm sure everyone's seen this already but if you haven't, check it out. Bernie Sanders is the most on-the-mark, consistent, honest politician I've seen talk, and I think this speech is brilliant. He certainly has my vote and, regardless of whether he wins, he is reshaping the political landscape of the election and he knows it. Voting and supporting him, regardless of the outcome of the election, will only serve to further this immensely positive alteration of the political landscape in the nation.

Everyone knew these were issues, but our politicians have downplayed and ignored them for a long time. All it took was someone from the inside to rise up and start speaking out about it in a straightforward, consistent, and unrelenting way. And Bernie's doing just that. I just think this is remarkable.

It's about attracting the best of the best.  Experience alone does not own a monopoly on determining what is best.  Having a top-tier education is as much if not far more important.

&gt; The US has a ton of fresh grads for the jobs. h1-b visas are used to depress wages.

And many of them are outshined by H1-B graduates.  There simply aren't that many to begin with at any rate.  I know post-doctorates from India who, after completing their studies at a top-tier US institution, still cannot find work here and are thinking about returning to India.  It's tough for everyone.

&gt; ""They only came to the US for a masters degree because it only takes 2 years and gives you the student visa you need to easily get a job in the US and convert to an h1-b visa. They do not get any education from the US, india has a perfectly functional university and schooling system for those that pay for it.

You say ""they do not get any education from the US"" but then state that they got a masters degree here before applying for H1B, again, more than likely at a top-tier US university.

&gt;""The indian workers will accept less pay.

Yes, I know, this was my whole point about the H1B process being a microcosm for the globalized labor market.  In the end, even if you shut down things like H1B, you're still going to have capital chasing after cheap labor.  Anyone who's taken a basic business course knows that labor is a cost to be marginalized, and is typically by far the largest cost in any operation.  Again, Sanders brings up some excellent talking points, but shutting the US out of the global marketplace may not be the best solution to the side effects of globalization, even if one of those side effects is the ""hollowing out"" of the US job market.

1523,"&gt; It's about attracting the best of the best. Experience alone does not own a monopoly on determining what is best. Having a top-tier education is as much if not far more important.

No it is not.  h1-b visas are supposed to be about experienced workers you cannot get locally.  Not the best of the best.  If there is a US worker that can do the job, even if only 90% as well as the indian, you are supposed to hire the US worker.

That is how the h1-b visa system legally is supposed to work. You have no valid justification for claiming otherwise.

h1-b abuse doesn't change what h1-b visas are actually for.  A lack of regulation and enforcement doesn't make you right. It only makes you more wrong.

&gt;And many of them are outshined by H1-B graduates

False.  I haven't met a single h1-b visa hire/co-worker that would be better than someone I went to school with who graduated.  There is so much extra teaching you have to do with an h1-b visa hire because they don't understand how people in the US think.  I would put an h1-b visa hire at requiring at least twice as long to train.  They also have a lower ceiling on how good they can get.

&gt;I know post-doctorates from India who, after completing their studies at a top-tier US institution, still cannot find work here and are thinking about returning to India. It's tough for everyone.

Just because they failed their attempt at using a student visa to get an h1-b visa doesn't mean much.  If they don't have minimal language skills many places won't hire them.  Indians with poor language skills are competing against the indians with better language skills.

Also, it shouldn't be tough for them, it should simply not be an option for them to get a job in the US when we have more than enough US grads to employ.

They have no right to a job in the US, they are not US citizens.  They have no right to even be in the US.

&gt;Yes, I know, this was my whole point about the H1B process being a microcosm for the globalized labor market. 

No, it is just one more way politicians have fucked over the US worker by making us compete more and more with cheaper less skilled labor that businesses deem, ""good enough"".

 &gt;Again, Sanders brings up some excellent talking points, but shutting the US out of the global marketplace may not be the best solution to the side effects of globalization

We aren't shutting ourselves out of anything.  What has h1-b visas gotten us?

So in places like Sweden, France, Spain, Greece, etc. when talk about the ""socialists"" is indeed quite mainstream, they're interestingly not really talking about transitioning their countries to socialist societies but rather about reforming their capitalist countries.

This leads to some confusion in discussion here when people talk about the current ""socialist countries in Europe, like Sweden."" Sweden is a capitalist country, they have a capitalist class, free markets, workers sell their labor on a labor market, etc. It's a very different *form* of capitalism in that it has a very strong welfare state but it is still a capitalist country.

You say this as something with bad connotation I feel.

It's the other 40% that vote. So good luck to Bernie though it's highly unlikely for him to get even the nomination of the Dems.

Then theres the agenda embraced byElizabeth WarrenandJoseph Stiglitz, which is focused more on reforming rigged financial rules and deep structural problems that have exacerbated inequality""

It paints the picture that Warren and Sanders do not believe in boosting wages, economic mobility, and infrastructure.

Um..... proof? I didn't see any mention of hydrogen vehicles in the article nor have I heard Mr. Sanders ever even talk about them. So, unless you can provide evidence to support that ""clearly"" claim... i call BS. 

&gt;Now manufacturing those cars in a commercially accessible manner is on the manufacturers (looking at you Tesla - I am so not dropping $30K on a car).

Tesla makes battery powered electric cars... not hydrogen cars.

And you're wrong anyway. History has taught us that if left to their own devices, the REAL big auto manufacturers (aka not tesla, which is tiny... more like Chevy, Ford,  etc) won't care about the environment unless we force them to.. thats why we have CAFE fuel economy standards from the government.

Also the science can leave some people behind... can you explain what you meant by that? Because i think you're conflating what i said with the price of a Tesla... which would be a misunderstanding

&gt;We need good policy now and that's what Sanders is doing.

I disagree.  In fact that was the entire point of my post.  That sanders claim was incorrect: his policy suggestion would not break our dependence on cars. And it won't, as evidence by Europe, Japan, China and many other places with great public transit, systems we would model ours after, still have TONS of cars.

There are also so many studies out there showing that it could have a negative impact on IQ. While it seems benign to casual users, things can take a turn for the worse very easily.

1701,"&gt; Warren wouldn't even be considered in the ""liberal wing"" of the party if this was the 1980s, she'd be a sensible centrist or even a moderate Republican. 

I don't agree with that at all. Reagan is the most conservative president of the post-war era; at the very minimum, congressional republicans support for him in the 80s would have made them far to the right of Warren. Not to mention that the house was under democratic control during the entire decade, and still allowed quite conservative measures through: at least some democrats would have been far to her right as well.

To put some numbers at it, we can look at the DW-Nominate score of people that served in the 80s in the house/senate and that still serve today. Using the [98th congress house](http://voteview.com/HOUSE_SORT98.HTM) (Jan. 1983- Jan. 1985) and [senate](http://voteview.com/SENATE_SORT98.HTM) as a starting point, and comparing to the only Warren senate we have full data for, [the 113th congress senate](http://voteview.com/SENATE_SORT113.HTM) (Jan. 2013 - Jan. 2015) [and the accompanying 113th house](http://voteview.com/HOUSE_SORT113.HTM) we have:

* Ed Markey, 34th most liberal in the house at -0.522 in the 80s. In the present, he was the 28th most liberal in the house before moving to the senate.

* Patrick Leahy, 12th most liberal in the senate with -0.386 in the 80s. Present is 18th in the senate.

* Barbara Mikulski, 91st most liberal in the house, -0.385 in the 80s. Present is 19th in the senate.

* Chuck Schumer, 105th most liberal in the house with a -0.362 score in the 80s. Present is 25th in the senate.

* Carl Levin, 7th most liberal in the senate with -0.411 in the 80s. Present was 15th in the senate.

* Harry Reid, 156th most liberal in the house with a -0.289 in the 80s. Present is 36th in the senate.

You get the idea. Where does Warren rank today? Most liberal in the senate, with a score of -0.622 -- that's a more leftist rank than even Sanders gets, at -0.523 and 3rd. It's also to the left of the most leftward person in the 98th senate, William Proxmire (-0.574), and would be in the top 10 for the 98th house. It's far less extreme than the republican scores are -- someone as conservative as she is liberal would be just the 10th most conservative senator today (the most conservative, Mike Lee, has a score of 0.991!). Or put another one: she would barely be in the top 20% of most extreme senators in the republican caucus, if she were to be as conservative as she currently is liberal.

So, no. Warren, as she votes and acts today, would absolutely *not* have been a ""centrist or even a moderate republican"" in the 80s. That's just a farcical interpretation of the past. ",5,0.134995039683,0.286784883418,0.47839781746,0.292681597609,1.3,0.9,472,0.0632411067194,18.1538461538,0.03,0.5

1721,"I posted the following comment on /r/sandersforpresident.


Here's a few reasons why he's likely to lose the nomination.  


**1. Hillary Clinton has a historic lead**. This is easy enough to explain. The [RCP poll of polls](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html) Shows her leading her closest opponent (Sen.Warren) by 50%. Even in the recent polls where Warren has not been included, Sanders still trails by 50%. These leads are consistent through the early states, with the possible exception of New Hampshire, where she ""only"" leads by 28% (but that lead has expanded in recent polls with the exclusion of Elizabeth Warren). These are leads she never experienced against Obama in '08. In addition, in multiple nationwide polls, she has led the field by similar margins *among all constituencies*, again in contrast with the liberal discontent that plagued her in 2008. These are steep numbers to overcome, yet they are merely one part of a large hole for Sanders.

**2. Sanders isn't actually a Democrat**. This is one of those things that seems like it wouldn't matter, seeing as he caucuses with them, but it really does. As an independent, Sanders doesn't have the connections with the party leadership that any Senator/Governor would, let alone Hillary Clinton. I don't just mean the DNC and the superdelegates, by the way, I mean the network of activists from DREAMers to labor to gay rights activists and many more in between (If you want to read more about how the party ultimately decides the nominee, I'd recommend reading the book ""[The Party Decides](http://www.amazon.com/The-Party-Decides-Presidential-Nominations/dp/0226112373)"". That structure has already gotten behind Clinton in a big way, which we can know through the amount of endorsements she receives, and again we see a contrast to '08. In '08, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer were begging Obama to run and beat Clinton. This time around, Schumer has endorsed Clinton, along with several other USA. Senators. The best way I've seen is put is from Larry Sabato, Director of the UVA's Center for Politics, saying that Sanders [is an outsider in what is very much an insider process](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2016-president/).

**3. Sanders has no national network**. Unlike O'Malley (in '14) and the Clintons (for the past 6 years), Sanders hasn't, to the best of my knowledge, been going around the country cheering on and campaigning for local/statewide/federal candidates. The Clintons have a tightly coordinated network of organizers and party leaders all over the country. Now, this might be the easiest hurdle for Sanders to overcome, but....

**4. Sanders is at an enormous money disadvantage**. I'm sure you've seen that chart showing how much Hillary has raised vs how much Bernie has raised. In case you don't know, in 2010, the Supreme Court ~~unleashed Pandora's Box~~ removed the cap on independent spending by a Super PAC, in a case known as Citizens United vs FEC. This means that none of the PACs that will be ""unofficially affiliated"" with Hillary Clinton have to disclose donors, and they will have as much money to spend as they please. Sanders will be taking no corporate money, nor will he have a Super PAC. These are noble aims, for sure, but they put him at a severe disadvantage in a race as expensive as this. 

**Should you give up and not support Sanders?** **NO!** While he isn't likely to win, participating and getting involved will shape the debate in the Democratic primary. If Sanders does well enough, then we could see a shift in the DNC to move left as an organization and cover their left flank. That would represent a change in the elected officials from the state level to the national. Hillary isn't likely to be pushed left, but the party can be, and it all starts with Sanders injecting new and disaffected voters into the process.",4,0.106950986866,0.162958120102,0.440867023748,0.275948140678,0.8,0.9,652,0.0606060606061,17.1578947368,0.075,0.28

Republicans know that they can get conservative's eyes to glass over with the words ""free trade,"" but they have to be smart enough to see that there really is nothing free about lopsided trade deals. And, I question whether protecting mega-huge corporate interests should be conservative policy. Exactly like protecting big banks who are too big to fail really should not  conservative policy - remember how all the republicans were fawning over the idea of repealing Glass-Steagal?

Sanders isn't an appeal to a subset of Democrats; his run is an appeal for Clinton to a subset of Republicans/independents.

&gt;It's still an opinion that he doesn't have a chance due to all of the ""evidence"" you used being not much more than opinion of why he wouldn't win.

An opinion that's grounded in trends and historical data, which is as close as you'll get when predicting in politics. 

&gt; I'm asking for the REAL hard evidence that proves ""BERNIE SANDERS CANNOT WIN"" until I see that I refuse to believe that just because some of you people have an opinion of why he won't win, is why he won't win.

I see. By this logic, Vermin Supreme is also a viable presidential candidate, because there's no REAL hard evidence that proves ""VERMIN SUPREME CANNOT WIN"". At some point, you have to acknowledge that data and trends have predictive value, lest you consider all of the jokers who've filed with the FEC to be legitimate threats. 

&gt;...does not mean that you can predict the future or know how the elections will pan out.

You should read the comment. I said he's ""likely to lose"" - not ""he will lose"". Probabilities aren't definitive, and I acknowledge that. Yet I think I have put forward, through trends and historical behavior, as good of an argument as I can to support my side - an argument, I might add, that's more supported than...

&gt; If you pussies stopped being so on the fence on the matter and were willing to take a risk and just fully support Sanders then maybe the election would pan out differently from how you ""expect"" it to go.

Well, wait. Who said I wanted to ""fully support Sanders""? I want to see who else is running. I want to give O'Malley and Webb a chance. Who I *think* is gonna win and who I *want* to win don't necessarily need to be the same thing. 

&gt;Can't expect change if you don't pursue it yourself.

I've been involved in local organizing around city and countywide issues, and I also staffed for the gubernatorial and senate race last year in my state. You don't need to lecture me about change.

&gt;Sanders has more of a chance than Hillary of Jeb Bush do, but then again I'm not afraid of being wrong as long as I've supported my beliefs until the bitter end.

I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure European taxes are very high because of their ""socialist"" programs. There is no such thing as free, because everything has a cost. Either time, labor, money, etc all go into producing anything. So Sanders can't make college tuition ""free"" he's trying to subsidize it. I think it's a step in the right direction and here's why. Precluding almost every crisis there is a bubble that forms and when that bubble pops is when the crisis is realized. The stock market bubble with the great depression, the housing bubble with the great recession are two great examples. Currently young people are in a position where higher education is no longer an extra bonus, it's become a criteria for decent paying jobs (I'm excluding trades here). Also most young people do not have the funds required to pay out the insane costs of college tuition, and the bigger problem is that [tuition is rising.]( http://sites.psu.edu/kmkretzer/wp-content/uploads/sites/15015/2015/04/College-Tuition-Costs.jpg) Because of this nearly everyone that attends college needs help. Whether that be through grants, loans, scholarships, etc at some point they're education is being subsidized. The problem with the student debt bubble is that it is young people that don't have their day figured out let alone their life. With massive amounts of debt some people may not even desire to graduate because they do not want to incur additional costs. When debt grows there becomes a ""bankruptcy point"" where you can no longer keep up with payments and must default. This is bad news for the lenders. Education isn't a material object like real estate or stocks so I can't really predict what kind of effect a ""student loan crash"" would have but it can't be good. I think Sanders is introducing this legislation to avoid this kind of situation, and if he fails he can at least claim he tried. It does open up a huge realm of problems though. Such as what about those that have already defaulted/on the brink, what about those that are just getting started, or who have already finished paying? Also tuition being subsidized by the govt has issues that I believe you've already stated, that it potentially becomes a moral hazard problem, because if theses institutions are assured they will  ""bailed out"" in a sense then they can do whatever they please. There would need to be strict govt oversight into over 100s institutions which just becomes a logistical (and Republican) nightmare. I think it's a good idea and step in the right direction, but there are so many known/unknown ramifications to deal with that it can become very messy and complicated.

1751,"&gt; But Social Security is already redistributionary. It's not a repayment, although it's designed to look like it a little bit. You get more out of it per dollar you put in if you're low income than if you're high income. And you always have since its inception.

""Marginal utility at lower incomes is higher than at higher incomes"" is not the same thing as ""we increased the amount people pay in, but didn't increase the amount they got out.""

I'll put it in numbers to help you out.

Right now if you make $108,000 you pay the maximum possible payroll taxes, and will get back roughly $2,500 per month when you retire.  You get about 1.5x as much as someone who made $50,000.  Which means that while the additional money didn't scale 1:1, it still scaled.

Under Sanders' plan, someone making $200,000 pays in twice as much as someone making $100,000 but gets *zero* additional benefit.

Alternatively, they do get 1.5x as much, and the entire plan is a short-term benefit to social security and an even bigger long-term problem.

&gt;And that's not to mention the disabled and widows who get Social Security and might have paid nothing or nearly nothing into it...it is Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) after all.

Ignoring the ""D"" part of it (which is still relatively few people, and is 100% understood as welfare), survivor benefits is simply that the repayment goes to your heirs, which is the same as any other property interest.

&gt;Do you also think it's fundamentally unfair that higher income earners experience higher tax brackets?

No, because it's well-understood that we have a redistributive tax system.  And because the wealthy (arguably) do enjoy greater benefits from what our taxes pay for at least in some ways.

Nice straw-man, though ""since it'd be silly to make this argument about income taxes, it's silly to argue this about social security.""  Oy.

&gt; ""free trade"" deals that do more to give freebees to corporate IP holders than they do to reduce tariffs 

You should probably have some kind of citation for this.

&gt;(even Krugman, who loves free trade, is against the TPP deal)

Which is a valid argument about a *specific* trade deal.  Sanders' opposition seems to be to any trade deal which might risk U.S jobs (all of them) even if that deal on the whole will benefit the U.S economy.  No serious economist is against free trade in and of itself, but Sanders manages to talk about it like Smoot-Hawley was the best legislation in history.

&gt;and slashing Pell Grants (I presume? What other federal money gets thrown at covering college costs for kids?), then why vote Democrat?

You mean the billions of dollars in loans the government gives out at below-market interest rates?  With no oversight as to the actual costs incurred by the college, or the validity of the tuition rates, much less any kind of oversight in to whether spending $50,000 on a kid studying philosophy with a minor in French is going to yield a positive ROI?

[Or do you mean Sanders' plan to simply have the government pay for college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36a2to/bernie_sanders_to_introduce_bill_to_make_college/)

I'll link you to some numbers, [they're interesting](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2gat21/student_loan_debt_is_exploding_it_has_grown_so/ckhi8oh?context=3)

But you asked ""why vote Democrat?""

In part because there actually isn't a party right now that's pro-choice, pro-gay rights, pro-trade, anti-""just give money to colleges"", and isn't making ridiculously stupid arguments about the minimum wage.

So I go with the group that more closely mirrors my beliefs, and hope to change it.

I love how he is taking inspiration from the Eastern European countries that have always held their own subtle bragging rights over us. I believe that because many of them have never been in complete ""leadership"" of the world positions but are still entirely developed and self sufficient as countries, that they were able to shift to the peaceful positions where they stand, and focus on correcting their economy and educational system. Ending the nonsense wars isn't going to make changes, but pulling ourselves out of them will. So what if another jihadist blows up an Iranian school? I hate to sound insensitive, but that should only effect the people it directly effects, the state of Iran. Just an example, but to me it seems perfectly logical. We need to back the hell off and stop trying to be the Global Police. I mean, people wonder why these extremists in other countries hate and target us the most, it's because we stick our noses in business that doesn't concern us when we have issues of our own to attend to.


The greatest overall problem with the government today (in my eyes) however, is the corruption that people are not widely accused of - religious bias. If you base ANY decisions you make politically off your beliefs, that should be morally wrong and unAmerican.

Every single one of the countries that people (including Sanders) hold up offer higher education selectively.  I am still trying to find a large country that offers a GOOD free higher education for anyone who steps up to the plate.  

Maybe we can find a way to make it free and still be as inclusive as the US system is.  However all I ever read is we should just make it like Europe.  Well if that is the case, 60% ( US = 70% of HS attend college vs 28% of German students attending gymnasium and being entitled to free university, .28/.7= .4) of the past, present and future college students in the US would not qualify under this model.  Part of the reason that the US has become what it is can be attributed to a lack of a rigid selectivity process for college and just about anyone with the desire can find a way to go. 

So are we trying to model it after Europe ( and eliminate over half of the students that attend college) or are we not going to model it after Europe - in which case I want to see the plan.

[*Yochaigal*](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36d40l/a_democratic_socialist_campaign_its_about_time/crdgtdh) responds with an excellent point on Sanders' support of cooperatives. See one link regarding Bernie [on worker ownership](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-unveils-employee-ownership-legislation) and the relevant quote from the other link here:

*Sanders*: ""We need to develop new economic models to increase job creation and productivity. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations which ship our jobs to China and other low-wage countries, we need to provide **assistance to workers who want to purchase their own businesses by establishing worker-owned cooperatives**. Study after study shows that when workers have an ownership stake in the businesses they work for, productivity goes up, absenteeism goes down and employees are much more satisfied with their jobs.""

*Me*: As I understand it, capital circulation requires all three processesmoney, productive, and commodity capitalsbecause they co-determine one another and form a feedback loop of sorts. In the face of a hostile credit and merchant capital system, this is why worker control in relatively isolated production units rarely survives. The most famous exception to this is [*Mondragon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) because they also created their own credit structures and merchant capital outlets *in addition* to their productive assets. I'm sure a lot of this is familiar since you're part of a cooperative. I'm uploading [this book review](http://ge.tt/3MtkbeG2/v/0) of *Values at Work: Employee Participation Meets Market Pressures at Mondragon* which explains further.

[*Yochaigal*](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36d40l/a_democratic_socialist_campaign_its_about_time/crdmwzl): What you're saying here is very true. However, as a founder of two worker cooperatives (shoutout to /r/cooperatives) I will add this: although financial and legal status is still a major issue, every year there are more of us. That means more economic connections - and more capital to work with. For example, in my state (MA) the pioneer valley is full of so many successful co-ops that their co-op-run trade union (VAWC) has created a revolving loan fund for developing more worker co-ops.

There are plenty of other examples I could give, but I'm on phone at the moment and tapping is hard.

I think I included everything in the rewrite.

...

&gt;That's what I was saying, that people who say that it's pretty much a 50/50 between Bernie and Hillary are dead wrong, but also that people who think that if Bernie were to win the primary that that would spell certain victory for the GOP are also wrong.  

I fully believe that Bernie would do just fine against whatever Republican they decide to field. I'm not at all concerned that he wouldn't be capable as the Democratic nominee.

However he will not be allowed to be the Democratic nominee.

Sanders has the unfortunate history of voting and acting based on his principles.  He is the type that as president would act in the best interest of the people as best he could, regardless of the effect on others in power.

That is not something that can be allowed near the White House.

If he was to get into the White House, he would quickly have his hands tied.  But even then he would have the potential to draw attention to a variety of issues. For example he is exactly the type that would push for changes to our stupid first past the post voting system.  There is no way they would allow him to change it, but he could draw a great deal of attention to it.  That is not something that either the Republicans or Democrats want to see happen.

And mind you I don't want this to sound like some conspiracy nut saying that there is a group of Illuminati masterminds behind the Republicans and Democrats, but what I mean is that every one of those Republicans and Democrats will vote in their best interest. And their best interests is to maintain the status quo.

&gt;But maybe you wouldn't actually disagree with that since you were talking about strategic voting in the general, which, speaking just for myself, I certainly intend to vote for whoever the democratic nominee is, mostly for judicial nominations and because none of the GOP candidates will likely do anything positive on the issue of climate change.

Agreed, and a host of other issues similar to that.  The Supreme Court is a long term impact on the decisions that we make for president.

&gt;Though I would disagree that it's a virtual impossibility for Bernie to win the primary.  As best as anyone can tell right now his chances are slim, but that small chance of him winning is dependant on people, maybe like yourself, who would prefer to see him win over Hillary, and who decide to put in work for the campaign, talk about him with friends/family/co-workers, and donate whatever they can, instead of giving in to the idea that he can't win and should therefore receive no tangible support from people who in fact think he is the best candidate.

If sheer determination and tenacity of the supporters were enough to put a person into office, we would currently be enjoying our third term with ron paul as president.

&gt;His slim chances aren't solely based on name recognition and assumed inevitability, a certain level of apathy by those who may actually support him is assumed as well, and he will lose if his supporters don't put in the work for him to win.  Basically, as he himself said, something of a political revolution is needed for him to win, which I think sounds more daunting than is actually the case.

The only way that we're going to see a political revolution is if we have a way to make our actual voices heard. This ""all or nothing"" system of government is largely to blame.  Nearly every presidential election that I have taken part in has ended with me having to vote for the lesser evil. With the exception of the 2000 election, I have always voted Democrat. And that is unfortunate.  The person I vote for should be something that requires a bit of thought. It should require me to listen to several people stances and opinions on issues, as well as their recommendations to solve problems, and then voting for who I feel would do best in the position.

Currently though? I vote for the person who I feel will do the least harm.

These are the things that matter most to me, and I'm hoping they'll be the things that people notice when the debates begin.  He answers questions by telling you what he *will do*, not what his opponents *won't do*.  He tries to give examples of the problems he feels we face, to better frame and ground his positions.  It's very refreshing to see, especially considering our current political climate, where candidates can get away with telling you almost next to nothing about themselves, by diverting your attentions to the inadequacy of their counterparts.

I'm not stupid enough to believe that he'll be able to continue this indefinitely.  Being a good politician means being able to show, not only why you are the right candidate, but why your opponent is the wrong candidate.  Unfortunately, that usually means some form of negative advertising or campaigning.  But, like I said, it's refreshing to see a candidate who's early focus is on really making sure that the people know who he is, what he's about, where he sees problems, and how he wants to fix them.

Except I would say the majority of leftist liberal Democrats thought Obama was one of them in the first election (and to a lesser extent in the second)... the whole ""hope and change"" thing. I still remember reading how Obama was going to be a major shift to the left. But really, he didn't stimulate all that much ""hidden"" progressive vote, mostly because I don't think there is very much hidden leftist vote, despite what you see here on /r/politics, which is far outside the mainstream American electorate.

* **Infrastructure**: ASCE ranked US as D+ on condition of infrastructure. Plan: Invest &gt;$1tn over 5 years in public works projects to revamp our national infrastructure and generate 13 million jobs. If ASCE estimates that if we don't make this improvements by 2020, the US will have lost $3.1tn in GDP and 3.5m jobs.

* **Climate Change**: Carbon credits, fund research (vague still!)

* **Tax Reform**: Has previously heavily advocated (and voted for) an aggressively graduated tax schedule which lowers the burden for lower/middle class Americans, closes corporate and high income loopholes. (Vague)

* **Social Safety Net**: Strengthening social safety net including SS, Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition programs

* **Universal Healthcare**: Single payer system (vague, but look at his record)

* **Financial Regulation**: Instead of allowing institutions to grow so large they must be bailed out, regulate Wall St to emphasize its actual utilities: primarily to facilitate flow of capital and maintain liquidity. Sanders proposes to break up large financial institutions into smaller independent organizations which cannot collude to drive profits.

* **Education**: Make some base standard of higher education free.

* **Trade Policy**: Stop creating policies (NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR) that make it profitable to move jobs overseas. Remove America from the ""race to the bottom"" which China can undoubtedly win.

* **Female Pay Inequality**: Simple, just guarantee equal pay for equal work. Unsure on specifics of implementation here.

* **Higher Minimum Wage**: Raise national minimum wage to $15/hr over the next few years, guarantee no one working 40hrs/week lives in poverty.

* **Strengthen Trade Unions**: Prevent corporations from discouraging/weakening unions which are desired by majorities of their employees.

* **Worker Co-ops**: Instead of providing tax breaks to corporations, provide tax breaks to individuals who choose to purchase portions of their employer-company, thus incentivizing the creation of worker-owned cooperative companies.

This strategy might have worked in the past when all media was controlled by billionaires and multi-national corporations, but social media and the internet have evolved to fill the void for speaking truth to power. 

I believe the biggest problem this nation has is the inequality explained in Robert Reich's movie, ""Inequality for All"" (and everything that led to it, like Citizens United and the campaign financing's corruption of government). Hillary has correctly latched onto the inequality issue as her campaign's linchpin, but her ties to Big Ag are in direct contradiction to her trumpeted (but vague) position on the inequality issue. How can she claim to be ""for the middle class"" when 90% of citizens want GMO labeling, and Hillary's pro-GMO and getting very large donations from Big Ag?!

Iowa saw through her, and has now coined the phrase, ""Bride of Frankenfood"". I really think the name's going to stick because it's so perfect. I thought being pro-GMO was only a vote deal-breaker for me. I hardly know anyone complaining about GMOs like me. I hate that Iowa and NH are the only states getting all the candidates' attention. I'm so glad Iowans have seen through the charade and are holding Hillary accountable, and Bernie Sanders is getting traction because of it. I've been asking (ok hounding) Hillary's Facebook page to post Hillary's positions on the issues. I know, a basic expectation, right? They flat out REFUSE! They insist that her ""silence"" on the issues is ""ok"" and tell me to ""google her"". It's arrogant of Hillary to assume she can ask for support, volunteers and votes without even stating her positions on the issues!

It's funny that you assume I'm American, I'm Brazilian (check my posting history). I can guarantee you neither natural resources nor ocean access make a country economically great. The economic developmentalist path Sanders wants America to take has been the Brazilian path for a century. The results?

It sounds like what you might support is a higher capital gains tax in exchange for subsidizing college. But even that's a false dichotomy - there is tax revenue and tax expenditure and no feasible way to force Representatives to meaningfully relate the two. In truth trying to relate the two is a political tactic. The discussion around what we should subsidize or tax should be a question of economic externalities, and the discussion around what we should spend tax revenue should is a question of what goods produce greater utility when provided by the public rather than private sector (health care, education, utilities.) Economics, not politics, is at the heart of public finance.  

If you want subsidized college, and I agree it's a valid goal, then argue to make that a spending priority. There's no need to disincentivize investment behavior, there's plenty of room in the budget. Our democratic representatives just don't agree that it's a priority.

You're way off the mark. EUFTT is hardly comparable to the Sander's proposal. Two major distinctions that spring to mind are: first, the size of the levy - the EU is talking about a tax that would be more like 0.01-0.1% - Sanders proposes 0.5%, a substantial difference; and second, the scope of application - the EU is aiming to explicitly target financial institutions - Sanders wants to tax ""every $100.00 of stock trades"" ... whatever that applies to.

&gt; The only thing this tax would TRULY hurt is HFT's...

That's not even certain. HFT profits come from trading enormous volumes for small gross margins. HFT exists because there's huge demand for tight spreads in markets and that need is not going away soon. HFT models will adjust to transaction taxes and still race the markets.

&gt; Companies are freely trading trillions upon trillions of dollars, for basically free (tiny tiny administrative tax).

At the very best, this is a justification for transaction taxes that pay for market security and enforcement of anti-fraud and securities laws. Education funding couldn't be further from the activity of financial transactions.

&gt; Tons of investors will actually play markets in other countries to completely avoid capital gains taxes.

... and financial transaction taxes create a new incentive to do just that. It gives way to a race to the bottom where transactions will race to more obscure, less transparent and regulated, lower tax national markets.

&gt; We have kids who can't afford college We have school districts cutting funding to Arts, Music, Sports We have school districts closing early due to no funding

Student loan debt should be forgiven, the United States should have single-payer higher education, federal income taxes should be raised on high earners, wealth and estate taxes should be implemented, there are ten thousand better ways to address the unfairness of education in America.

I support increased education funding, I don't support linking it to transaction taxes. FTT reliant education funding would rise and fall based on the volume of exchange transactions. Education supporters would find ourselves rooting for volatile, chopping markets with lots of transactions to keep the gravy rolling in. When the business cycle peaks and economies enter recession values and volumes will plummet which would make education funding even more cyclically-aligned, thriving in boom times and thirsting in all others.

Education is an easy target for cuts because of complex political factors. If FTT is a huge success, its revenues will almost certainly be plundered by future politicians for the sake of more powerful interests than teachers and middle class families.

America needs education funding that is reliable, not paid for by stock trades.

This is like how certain liberals freak the fuck out about GMO foods *when literally anything they eat is a 'GMO'* because it's a human grown cultivar and not a wildtype plant (which still has selective pressures)

Sure.

Secondly, I don't understand why the tax will be funding college educations. Currently the high price stems from overabundance of demand for college education.

You need to have it like, say Joe makes that 1 trade worth 100, he pays 50 cents, if bob pays say half a cent per trade, that will mean Bob pays 5 dollars in fees rather than 50 cents. 

&gt;HFT is already less profitable per trade than it was. More competition. Many of the large HFT firms have spread to markets accross the world trying to capture some of that old magic.

It's still pretty damn lucrative, and should be stopped in my opinion, and putting a fee to every transaction could go a long way to slowing it down a lot more than this could, and could actually stop it. 

&gt;If you put a small fee on trades in the US markets that would be a huge blow, mainly, to HFT firms that are currently still (despite lower profits) scraping billions from our capital markets every year.

You can keep lowering profits, and still keep them doing what they do, once you turn it into losses, or barely breaking even, then it will stop. What Sanders proposed would lower the profits some, but not by a lot, and almost certainly not enough to stop it.

&gt; 3) Find why college is so expensive and reduce that cost.

There are many people who think that college is expensive because of exactly what Sanders is proposing. College tuition has been increasing much faster than inflation ever since the federal government started paying for people's education and subsidizing their student loans. Most people can attend any college they get into because of those loans and grants, so colleges have stopped trying to make their tuition rates competitive. There is even a college near me that significantly increased their tuition (without changing their services) because it made them look more selective and elite.

In summary, taxing the investors of America (whose capital funds the economy) to pay for tuition has the potential to make the investors poorer, the universities richer, and the students just as poor, but more dependent on the government than they started.

Please feel free to correct my mistakes.

Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is appealing to a very polarised base; but take a look at his proposals.

1920,"So almost everything Sanders says falls apart under learned analysis, but on the surface seems to benefit the population. 

There are several things wrong with this particular policy he's espousing:

The biggest problem is that he's attacking this from the wrong direction. [Extremely high government spending, subsidies, and subsidized loans are exactly the cause of soaring tuition rates.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-college-tuition-costs-so-much.html?_r=0) Here sanders is doing the populist thing of ""Hey students, I'll give you money!"" when the economic thing is to actually stop giving away money to schools. All this will do is immediately cause tuition to go up again, creating a worse problem down the line. 

The economic theory is that schools lately have faced a completely price-insensitive payer: the US government, and so naturally have kept raising prices far beyond inflation or costs or anything else would dictate. 

On the taxing stock transactions side, it's a complicated issue but several points against it:
1. The US economy is still in a VERY fragile economy. GDP growth this year was 0% in Q1, quite a poor number (There's a seasonal winter effect, but still). It's well established economics that a transaction tax slows the velocity of money in the system, which then slows reinvestment and growth. Any macroeconomic participant will tell you that it's a pretty bad idea to do this for the US right now. 

2. Sanders is proposing a gigantic, unrealistic tax. At 0.50%, it's larger than almost every transaction tax in the world, most of which are around 0.10%. The US at one point in history had a 0.04% tax. 

3. Historically, most financial transaction taxes end up creating FAR less tax profits than expected (see Sweden, etc). Most remaining investment moves offshore to avoid the tax, and all you do is kill your financial centers, like NYC and Chicago. Believe me, London, Frankfurt, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sao Paolo, would LOVE to take over the US's position as a financial hub. 

There are many many more points against further financial taxes, but I doubt you could find a single economist who would say this is a good idea for the US right now. 

Anyway, the reason I'm personally not a fan of Sanders or Warren is they push the ""us against them"" fiction and loudly push policies that on the surface punish the ""baddies"" and help the populace, but in reality would have very negative broad-based effects. I don't have all the answers on how to fix the problems that the US faces, but it's certainly not the ridiculously simple solutions that these populist guys tout.

Now that we have that settled, do you agree with the following statement: Income and wealth inequality are problems that need to be resolved? (Not in totality, I am not talking about everyone has the same income and wealth, but something less skewed than it is now).

If you do not agree with the above statement then we will not agree and I'll leave it at that.

If you do agree, what do you propose? Taxing the rich more is only part of the solution. Investment in infrastructure, education, and job training programs may be another part. Raising the minimum wage could be another. Employee-owned business models could be another. 

The ""increase"" in taxes we saw in January were the following;

* Top marginal tax rate increased from 35% to 39.6% - Still well below historical highs.
* Top marginal rate on long-term capital gains and dividends increased from 15% to 20%
* The estate tax was increased from 35% to 40% on estate's worth more than (roughly) $5,000,00 (which ends up being like less than 10,000 families).

I would also not expect such a modest increase in taxes that's only been collected for the last 5 months to have any considerable impact on the economy so soon afterwords.

After tax corporate profits are the highest they've been since before the great depression. The share of wealth and income to the top 1% is the highest it's been since the great depression.

""If your income was in the top 40%, youve likely seen your wealth go up in the past two decades. If you are in the bottom 60, its probably gone down. The top 10% has seen their median net worth increase 61% since 1989."" - http://graphics.wsj.com/inequality-in-america/

So, okay, increasing taxes on the wealthy doesn't solve anything. How do we solve the growing income and wealth gap? If you don't think it's a problem I'd say go check out Robert Reich's movie ""Inequality for All"" where he makes a pretty convincing argument that such extreme disparities in wealth are a threat to democracy itself. And things like Citizens United (which Bernie Sanders wants to overturn with a Constitutional Amendment) only exacerbates the issue - http://mic.com/articles/87719/princeton-concludes-what-kind-of-government-america-really-has-and-it-s-not-a-democracy

I don't know if Bernie Sanders is the solution, but what I do know is that something needs to change. People say change isn't always good, but at this point I don't see how it can get any worse.

2010,"&gt;I think what you're missing is that there is a spectrum for these definitions.

No, I'm very well versed in what the different types of capitalism and socialism are.  I'm just not sure that you know what socialism is.  

&gt;Those European countries are not capitalist countries.

Yes, they are.  Again, let's look at Norway.  They use Nordic capitalism. Nordic capitalism refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state.  

&gt;They use a very large % of their GDP for socialized programs.

Which, again, is a welfare state and not socialism.  A welfare state is a concept of government in which the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. 

&gt;See, you're being lenient with the mark of ""capitalist,"" but not ""socialist.""

To me, it is you who is not being lenient.  You are saying that these European countries, who are self described capitalist are not.  They are socialist in your mind, because you buy into the same definition of socialism as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  There are many different types of socialism such as state socialism, agrarian socialism, common ownership, etc.  Europe meets none of these.  Furthermore, given what you are describing as socialism, there are no capitalist countries in the West, but surely the United States is right?  The biggest difference between Nordic Countries and the US is that they have a larger welfare state, but both the US and Europe have welfare states.  A welfare state is independent of both economic models, as they are found and not found in both capitalism and socialism.  

&gt;Unions playing a large role in deciding where profits go is a more ""socialized"" model than when no unions exist.

Right, but ""socialized"" does not mean socialism.  Otherwise, if I had an ice cream ""social"" at work, then that would be considered socialism because it has the word ""social"" in it.  

Socialism is clearly defined as social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy.  In socialist economics, socialization is the process of structuring or restructuring an economy on a socialist basis, usually by establishing a system of production for use in place of the profit system, along with the end of the operation of the laws of capitalism. In its most developed form, the concept of socialization entails the end of money and financial valuation in the production process.  [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_(economics))

&gt;A business owner can't make decisions about his business while workers strike. 

That's emphatically not true. If he decides to sell the company while workers on strike he has made a major decision.  Unions are not owners of the company.  Unions are just an organization of workers who have a common goal.    

&gt;There's also differing in definitions. See what Noam Chomsky says about political definitions like ""libertarian"" and ""anarchy,"" to see how far definitions can differ.

Everything that I have just defined in this reply is straight from wikipedia, which is referenced to economic textbooks.  If you have taken an economics class in college you would see similar definitions.  You, however have made almost every country socialist, just because you believe that social welfare is socialism which it isn't.  That's a fact, and isn't debatable.  


&gt;Fact is, a living politician called a democratic socialist is synonymous with many social democrats of Europe. Their views are very similar. Sander's views match very well with how many EU countries operate

Fact is there are democratic socialist in the EU, and lots in Nordic countries, but their countries are capitalist states.  Just like Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist in the US, which is a capitalist state.  


&gt;Sanders often advocates for the US to mimic Denmark. Maybe you can argue Sanders misrepresents himself with this label of democratic socialist. But his views are implemented in many countries.


Sanders is pushing for a larger welfare state such as the one in Denmark.  However, Denmark, is a free market economy.  NOw that we know that welfare state does not mean socialism, we aren't going to try and say that a free market economy is **not** capitalism are we?

Denmark's economy stands out as one of the most free in the Index of Economic Freedom and the Economic Freedom of the World. [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark#Economy)

&gt; Socialism is a complete opposite, where everyone has possession.

Now, that is a definition I can agree with, however it contradicts everything else you said.  Nordic countries do not have social ownership of the country.  Unions do not have social ownership of a company.  

&gt;Public educations is a socialized program. Socialized medicine works similarly. See definitions from wiki[1] if you want.

Socialized programs **ARE NOT** socialism.  Social programs are welfare subsidies used to help the population.  It is not social ownership of the means of production.  That is what the definition of socialism is.  Welfare, again, is not socialism.  Just because it has the word social in it does not make it socialism.  This is common knowledge that you would pick up in any economics 101 class.  I find it hilarious how some would not like the way FOX news vilifys socialism and then use the same definition for socialism themselves.  

&gt;Because we live in a democracy, this use of taxation is socialist.

No, that's wrong.  Taxation is not socialism.  This conversation is exasperating because you fail to grasp or don't want to grasp, the simple definitions of what welfare, capitalism, socialism, and taxation are.  I don't mean that to be rude, but it's like me talking to someone and them telling me that the sky is not blue, and that I am the one who is close minded, when it is obvious to anyone else that the sky is blue.  The school of economics disagrees with what you say socialism is.  The countries you say are socialist declare themselves as capitalists.  There is clearly nowhere we can move forward with in this conversation.

First, most politicians are smart enough to (a) recognize what sorts of questions will be asked of them, based upon their previously stated positions, and (b) will have prepared ready responses regarding issues they're asked about all the time.

This on the other hand has no chance; as soon as they want to end this long speech, they just have to get cloture. The vote on cloture is the important action.

Sen. Paul making a long speech against these programs is a good thing, debating is supposed to be part of what Congress does.

Because this is about the role of large overbearing government should play in our lives. Sanders believes that government is good, and can do everything for everyone. This is a filibuster on large government more than anything, of which Sanders is a proponent of.

Sanders is also an extremely partisan politician, and has one of the worst track records for working across the aisle. He has specifically gone after Republicans that hold some of the same views he has, for just being Republicans. He will go out of his way to not work with Republicans, even if he has the same views and beliefs with them.

The most recently is Loretta Lynch. He criticized Republicans for being against her nominations, saying they had no real reason to be opposed to her nomination. When, many Republicans, especially Rand, were against her because of Asset Forfeiture. Lynch is a Wall St. insider, and is extremely soft on financial criminals, you think he would join with Republicans and add that to the debate, but nope, he criticized Republicans, then applauded when he rubber stamped her nomination and blamed Republicans that it took so long.

Personally, I agree with [Lawrence Lessig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2z9lV3W1g)'s assessment that monetary corruption within the political system is the root of this problem. This one problem screws over the people again and again, as they find that any time that corporate interests conflict with public interests, the corporate masters get their way. The monetary corruption problem has be be solved first so that other social reforms can take place unhindered.

As for how we do that, a few dedicated groups I know of are:

* [Mayday PAC](http://mayday.us) - Lessig's ""SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs""

* [Wolf PAC](http://wolf-pac.com) - PAC formed by Cenk Uygur (from The Young Turks) to gain momentum towards a constitutional amendment through state legislatures for overturning Citizens United and getting money out of politics

* [Rootstrikers](http://rootstrikers.org) - Lessig's pre-Mayday group for action on this issue

2077,"Here is what Sanders mentioned his main objectives were in his AMA yesterday.

&gt;Great question. And let me repeat what I have said many times. The only way we deal with the major issues facing our country -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens United, demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, making college affordable for all, etc. -- is when ordinary people put massive pressure on the Congress.

Not addressing the fact that he wants people to act through the government, by putting pressure on their congress to pass laws, we can go through all of those one by one.

* raising the minimum wage to a living wage

Sanders wants to raise the minimum wage by forcing companies to pay more, or else. He doesn't want to address the root cause to why people aren't making a minimum wage, he just wants the government to step in and tell people to pay more.

[Source](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/237072-republicans-blocks-sanders-minimum-wage-amendment)

* rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure

Sanders only thinks this is possible by taxing people, and spending money. He thinks government spending $1 Trillion dollars will completely fix the problems.

[Source](http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/230866-sen-sanders-files-1t-infrastructure-bill)

* addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens

Sanders believes the way to fix climate change is to tax companies more, and subsidize clean energy, and have the government offer rebates.

[Source](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-boxer-propose-climate-change-bills)

* overturning Citizens United

By literally proposing a Constitutional Amendment. Nothing says ""The Government is the only way to fix our problems"", by literally calling for a change to the basis of all of our laws.

* demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes

You can't say that taxing people, means the government isn't the solution.

* making college affordable for all

Again, he doesn't address any reasons why college is so expensive, mainly because of government subsidies, but wants to tax people more, to subsidize it even more.

2090,"I wish everyone would realize how bad an idea this is.  I sorta wish a GOP introduced it than everyone here wouldn't be so blinded because their savior Bernie Sanders is the one behind it and would be able to critically look at the idea. 

There was a post earlier that was saying how more and more people are getting degrees only to work at Starbucks or someplace.  This makes perfect sense.  If everyone who wants to go to college is able too then you diminish the value of the degree greatly.  Or rather I should say, if everyone who THINKS they need to go to college.  

There's very very few jobs anymore that you can get simply based on having a degree.  Maybe 30yrs ago or so having a degree would get you a decent job right out of school now employers are flooded with new college degree applicants and it really becomes not about the degree but who you know inside the company. 

The current system is government guarantees student loans. A student gets a loan after being bullshitted that they're going to get a great job and that college is an investment in their life!!  Colleges knowing that students can get funding jack of their rates year after year.  Student graduations with tens of thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands in debt that they must pay off.  Sanders plan does nothing to incentivise colleges to lower costs or make cuts. Sure it will be ""free"" as in you won't see a bill each month but it will be far from free in reality. 

So what should the solution be?  

*1. I think we should cut off all guaranteed loans this will force colleges too lower rates or else not enough people would be able to attend.  

*2. Cooperate with the states to create some sort of merit based tuition assistance program.  Everyone that has a 3.0 or higher gpa out of high school would qualify. The program would pay between 50-70% of your total tuition costs based on your gpa and you'd need to attend a state college of the state you're a residence in. If a student would like to attend a private or out of state college then they'd only be awarded whatever the federal contribution would of been.  

*3.  If a person has a gpa lower than 3.0 they have the option of simply paying out of pocket to the school they desire or they can go to the more affordable community college.  They also can reapply to assistance in 2years.  So if they maintain a 3.0 gpa in their first 2 years of college then they can get assistance for the remainder.

*4.  Everyone getting this assistance would be need to maintain at minimum a 2.5 average year after year.  If they fail to meet that requirement they would go on probation for a year, if they still don't bring their grades up in that year then they lose 50% of their assistance.  If after that they are able to bring their average back up then full aid is restored.  If they aren't able to then they lose their aid completely and have to wait 2 years or 3 semesters to reapply again.   

I think this will work much better then the ""free"" college for all idea because the taxpayers would be secure in knowing they are investing in the future by helping the best and brightest.  Students would learn the value of personal responsibility and doing the best job they can in school in order to get the most assistance and since that assistance doesn't pay 100% they would still need to either get scholarships, private loans, or work part time to make up the difference, this will teach them financial responsibility as well and finally while probably won't have the same effect at reducing college tuition if we were to just cut off all aid and let everyone pay for themselves. I believe it would still have an effect at reducing tuition rates since government wouldn't be guaranteeing 100% of the cost.

2121,"&gt; I'm taking from this that you are one of the people who believes that Hillary Clinton wants to work to rectify the injustice of maldistribution. 

All this sounds a bit too much like ""Claude Hooper Bukowski"" who believes in God and believes that God believes in Claude.  I don't think anyone is that naive. 

I think Hillary would favor ending maldistribution.  I think that the roots of maldistribution in the US go back to Nixon, that Nixon was a violation of the good that some Republicans had done, and by some I refer to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, and that during the Eisenhower period and then Kennedy-Johnson period the US had made dramatic strides toward reducing maldistribution.

No person is all good or all bad, although Nixon was certainly a prototype of evil and much of the problem of rising maldistribution we have faced and face today appear at least to be related to Republicans who followed Ford.

But part of the problem of rising maldistribution was because of the success at reducing maldistribution that America had experienced up to and including Lyndon Johnson: successes like recovery from the depression, like the GI Bill, like the end of racism in sports but these became associated with Johnson and with the Democratic party.  Johnson too did great things for civil rights.  But as result, Republicans formed a coalition against Johnson based on increasing maldistribution. And various outgrowths of the Republican party since Nixon have geared toward increasing maldistribution ""in reaction to"" what Johnson and the Democrats had achieved, because the Republican party could capture a a huge reactionary movement against civil rights.   Objectively you could not say that Johnson and the Democrats were ""united"" at their core on many issues, they were largely united in support of economic freedom for all  including those who had been wrongfully oppressed.   

The Republican view was that they could create a party by trying to stop this and thus became opposed to any efforts like the GI-Bill, like dual-use and its ability to provide research education which themselves provide both business and military research and capable entrants into the growth economy, and therefore competitive advantage for the United States.  Thus the efforts of Republicans, regardless belief or slogan wind up as both a full attack on the economic advantage of the United States, an abuse and ultimate deterioration of military power, an attack on economic freedom and an attack on sustainability.
 
Today  I hear the RW deplore terms like democracy and equality and one-man one vote, which are  words I grew up with that I associate mathematically with the very strength of this country.  But their attack on these words, as ideologically based as they may seem are an attack on the strength and resilience of the United States.

Does Bernie Sanders understand all of that?  Maybe.  But if we think that some single politician is ""God"" and God believes in Claude, that is not likely to prove correct or useful whether its Sanders or Clinton or whoever.

2136,"I see a lot of people focusing on the amount they have been fined and questioning whether or not they made profit. This is missing the point in my opinion. We are giving banks free reign to break the law and if they get caught the worst possible outcome is losing money. This is the same risk people take when trying to start a new business, how can you justify treating breaking the law as a business venture? It's a dangerous precedent.

As for why they are not being punished, I think most people are aware of why, they just don't like to admit it. No doubt there is a series of factors, one of which is these banks are some of the biggest donors to candidates on both sides of the political spectrum. Most of our politicians are not willing to bite the hand that feeds them.

Another reason why they are not treated like criminals is they are too big to fail. Pushing for criminal charges could have a negative effect on the economy because these banks are so large. Holder himself admitted that they are too big to jail, he later tried to retract this statement because the outrage it caused but we all know he was telling the truth. The HSBC drug money laundering case acted as a litmus test to determine whether banks were too big to jail or not. Once again the DOJ, being led by the current AG Loretta Lynch, opted to settle for a fine.

These banks are above the law and they know it. They openly lobby against reform and donate to politicians who will help maintain the status quo and gut bills like Dodd Frank. Some people like Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders have been tackling these banks hard but there is only so much they can do. Warren herself has admitted that taking on this trillion dollar industry scares her because they are so powerful. A great piece of insight into how powerful these bankers are came though one of Warrens books. In it she writes about how during a meeting with Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon she confronted him about his bank breaking the law.

Martin O'Malley is pretty disliked within his own state, campaigned heavily on gun control (goodbye southern swing states) and will likely crater as he's trying to commandeer a sector of the base Hillary already commands.  

Sanders can unify the far left of the Democrat base, but those blue-dog Democrats aren't going to go for him (and as you venture from the North-East and Pacific Coast, they become far more prevalent).  He's going to have some real problems in Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada (which constitute 75% of the first four primaries).  When we get to Super Tuesday, he's probably not going to carry the following states: Colorado caucuses, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and North Carolina.  He's going to be so far behind by that point that I can't imagine he stays in the race.  

I'm personally going for Rand Paul and I think that he has a better shot, though still not good, than Sanders does of getting the Nomination.  The Republican field is a hell of a lot deeper at this point than the Democrats, so I can't guess how it will go.  However, it's safe to say that the establishment favors Jeb Bush and to a lesser extent Scott Walker (and then Marco Rubio).  The Republicans are in a bit of a civil war so it is feasible that a dark horse could emerge, but we'll see. 

That being said, the Rand Pauls' and Bernie Sanders are likely there solely to steer the national conversation; which while I abhor Sanders' fiscal policies, I agree with him on a lot of Social and Civil Rights issues.  

That's my take on things though, because if we end up with another Clinton Bush ticket, that would mean that for at least 41 years of my life on this planet (at the time of the end of that term) I would have seen presidents from only 4 families (Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama.  An argument could be made that I saw Carter in the White House, but only for a few months and I 6 months old when he left office) in the White House and only three families since I was 9 years old.  That's certainly a problem.

&gt;Sanders had originally used the language of Ron Pauls HR 1207, which passed in the House as an amendment last year, but later changed his amendment under pressure by the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration. Sen. Vitter reintroduced an amendment with the original Audit the Fed language.

&gt; Ron Paul: Bernie Sanders, who was supposed to introduce my amendment and brought it up and at the last minute changed it. And I did have a conversation with him [on Friday, May 7]. He did describe it as, well that was the best he could get, it had to be watered down a bit. There was no way the other one would be passed, that argument.

&gt;I think he has one point. If his bill as it is written, even though its much different than my bill that I introduced, it probably would be better than the rest. But my point to him was that it would be important that we have the Senate at least be on record they havent voted for a much cleaner bill. If it doesnt pass, then offer his as a substitute and pass it. Under those circumstances I may well support it but I would want to go for the best bill.

 &gt;But it looks like Vitter may be introducing the much cleaner bill and I know Jim DeMint has worked hard on it. He would be supporting it to come up. Quite frankly I dont think it will pass. I think Bernie is counting the votes, he claims he has to have 60 votes to pass anything. But you know, if Dodd is supporting what Bernie wants to do as well as Reid has said that he would support Sanders, and if theyre supporting it it means the president is going to sign it, and if theyre all supporting it, **I would be very suspicious that the Fed is quite aware of this and theyre satisfied with this and maybe they think theyre getting off the hook.**

1. Socialism isn't objectively bad, it's just closer to how European countries are run. There is a lot to like, especially in terms of how the society cares for the lower class. I think the left wing of US voters likes Bernie because he is the most left politician in our Senate, and therefore fully supports most everything that left wing voters like. He's a zero compromise left wing candidate. That would be comparible to someone like Rick Sanatorum or Ted Cruz on the republican side.

2. Hillary being un-electable is pretty much only a reddit thing, which is a tiny subsection of the population and not representative of the population at large. From the beginning Hillary has been absolutely dominating the polls against republicans and other democrats alike. This is where the inevitable aspect of her candidacy comes in. 

Personally I'm not really high on Hillary or Sanders. Hillary is a pretty middle of the road democrat, who would probably be more like Obama than anything else. Sanders is great ideologically for me (as a liberal), but is unlikely to win in a general election. They are both OK I guess.

Anyway, if you are new to politics and interested, I would recommend NOT getting your information solely from reddit as there is a lot of crazy on here. Read other news sources, from reputable sources, and come to your own opinions. Personally I like to look at the candidates stances on the issues / policies and stay clear of manufactured news stories, or character politics such as ""how will so and so relate to me, if they eat arugula spinach"".

SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: THE TRANS - PACIFIC TRADE (TPP)
AGREEMENT MUST BE DEFEATED

The Trans - Pacific Partnership is a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largest multi-national corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy. It will also negatively impact some of the poorest people in the world.

The TPP is a treaty that has been written behind closed doors by the corporate world. Incredibly, while Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry and major media companies have full knowledge as to what is in this treaty, the American people and members of Congress do not. They have been locked out of the process.

Further, all Americans, regardless of political ideology, should be opposed to the fast track process which 
would deny Congress the right to amend the treaty and represent their constituents interests.

The TPP follows in the footsteps of other unfettered free trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA and the Permanent Normalized Trade Agreement with China (PNTR). These treaties have forced American workers to compete against desperate and low-wage labor around the world. The result has been massive job losses in the United States and the shutting down of tens of thousands of factories. These corporately backed trade agreements have significantly contributed to the race to the bottom, the collapse of the American middle class and increased wealth and income inequality. The TPP is more of the same, but even worse. 

During my 23 years in Congress, I helped lead the fight against NAFTA and PNTR with China. During the coming session of Congress, I will be working with organized labor, environmentalists, religious organizations, Democrats, and Republicans against the secretive TPP trade deal.

Lets be clear: the TPP is much more than a free trade agreement. It is part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system. If TPP was such a good deal for America, the administration should have the courage to show the American people exactly what is in this deal, instead of keeping the content of the TPP a secret.

10 Ways that TPP would hurt Working Families:

 1. **TPP will allow corporations to outsource even more jobs overseas.**
  * According to the Economic Policy Institute, if the TPP is agreed to, the U.S. will lose more than 130,000 jobs to Vietnam and Japan alone. But that is just the tip of the iceberg.
  * Service Sector Jobs will be lost.
  * At a time when corporations have already outsourced over 3 million service sector jobs in the U.S., TPP includes rules that will make it even easier for corporate America to outsource call centers; computer programming; engineering; accounting; and medical diagnostic jobs.
  * Manufacturing jobs will be lost.
As a result of NAFTA, the U.S. lost nearly 700,000 jobs. As a result of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, the U.S. lost over 2.7 million jobs. As a result of the Korea Free Trade Agreement, the U.S. has lost 70,000 jobs.
The TPP would make matters worse by providing special benefits to firms that offshore jobs and by reducing the risks 
associated with operating in low -wage countries.

 2. **U.S. sovereignty will be undermined by giving corporations the right to challenge our laws before international tribunals.**
   * The TPP creates a special dispute resolution process that allows corporations to challenge any domestic laws that could adversely impact their expected future profits. 
   * These challenges would be heard before UN and World Bank tribunals which could require taxpayer compensation to corporations. 
   * This process undermines our sovereignty and subverts democratically passed laws including those dealing with labor, health, and the environment.

 3. **Wages, benefits, and collective bargaining will be threatened.**
   * NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and other free trade agreements have helped drive down the wages and benefits of American workers and have eroded collective bargaining rights. 
   * The TPP will make the race to the bottom worse because it forces American workers to compete with desperate workers in Vietnam where the minimum wage is just 56 cents an hour.

 4. **Our ability to protect the environment will be undermined.**
    * The TPP will allow corporations to challenge any law that would adversely impact their future 
profits. Pending claims worth over $14 billion have been filed based on similar language in other 
trade agreements. Most of these claims deal with challenges to environmental laws in a number of countries.
The TPP will make matters even worse by giving corporations the right to sue any of the nations that sign onto the TPP.
These lawsuits would be heard in international tribunals bypassing domestic courts.

 5. **Food Safety Standards will be threatened.**
   * The TPP would make it easier for countries like Vietnam to export contaminated fish and seafood into 
the U.S. The FDA has already prevented hundreds of seafood imports from TPP countries because of salmonella, e-coli, methyl-mercury and drug residues. But the FDA only inspects 1-2 percent of food imports and will be overwhelmed by the vast expansion of these imports if the TPP is agreed to.

 6. **Buy America laws could come to an end.**
   * The U.S. has several laws on the books that require the federal government to buy goods and services 
that are made in America or mostly made in this country. Under TPP, foreign corporations must be 
given equal access to compete for these government contracts with companies that make products in 
America. Under TPP, the U.S. could not even prevent companies that have horrible human rights 
records from receiving government contracts paid by U.S. taxpayers.

 7. **Prescription drug prices will increase, access to life saving drugs will decrease, and the profits of drug companies will go up.**
   * Big pharmaceutical companies are working hard to ensure that the TPP extends the monopolies they have for prescription drugs by extending their patents (which currently can last 20 years or more). This would expand the profits of big drug companies, keep drug prices artificially high, and leave millions of people around the world without access to life saving drugs. Doctors without Borders stated that the TPP agreement is on track to become the most harmful trade pact ever for access to medicines in developing countries.

 8. **Wall Street would benefit at the expense of everyone else.**
    * Under TPP, governments would be barred from imposing capital controls that have been successfully used to avoid financial crises. These controls range from establishing a financial speculation tax to limiting the massive flows of speculative capital flowing into and out of countries responsible for the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s. In other words, the TPP would expand the rights and power of the same Wall Street firms that nearly destroyed the world economy just five years ago and would create the conditions for more financial instability in the future. 
    * Last year, I co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Harkin to create a Wall Street speculation tax of just 0.03 percent on trades of derivatives, credit default swaps, and large amounts of stock. If TPP were enacted, such a financial speculation tax may be in violation of this trade agreement.  

 9. **The TPP would reward authoritarian regimes like Vietnam that systematically violate human rights.**
   * The State Department, the U.S. Department of Labor, Human Rights Watch, and  Amnesty International have all documented Vietnams widespread violations of basic international standards for human rights. Yet, the TPP would reward Vietnams bad behavior by giving it duty free access to  the U.S. market. 

 10. **The TPP has no expiration date, making it virtually impossible to repeal.**
   * Once TPP is agreed to, it has no sunset date and could only be altered by a consensus of all of the countries that agreed to it. Other countries, like China, could be allowed to join in the future. For example, Canada and Mexico joined TPP negotiations in 2012 and Japan joined last year.

2281,"You have to remember Sanders is a socialist. The soundbite is that trade agreements ""kill jobs"", which may or may not be true depending on the nature of the agreement, but when he talks a little longer about them, it becomes clear that he opposes them for the simple reason that the mobility of capital erodes the negotiating power of labor. Whereas before a trade agreement it may have been possible for a national-scale union to successfully negotiate decent wages from a corporation, once a corporation is able to move jobs to and from other countries, the negotiating power of the union is undermined unless it too scales up to international level. This is not just practical for socialists, but ideological. Economic efficiency is not the top priority. They want labor to control capital. Thus, Sanders is being as consistent with his ideology in opposing trade agreements as Rand Paul is with his own in supporting them.

The fact you think words like ""treason"" or ""economic suicide"" fit like a glove scares the hell out of me.  Trade agreements are an important part in keeping up with the global economy.  If we fall behind, it can be disastrous.  Trade agreements are a necessity in the emerging markets, and they also help claim resources we need for cheap.

The one actual complaint I hear about TPP is that trade agreements ships jobs overseas and hurts wages.  Even Bernie Sanders agrees with those.  It's not true.  Trade agreements expand the free market area in the world.  Capitalism drives jobs overseas and lower wages.  Trade agreements provide opportunities for corporations to expand into other countries.  During the month of March this year, car sales by GM and Ford in China almost reached the US sales figures (443,192 vs 485,804).  This could not have been done without China and the US lowering tariffs on each other.  

We will always see jobs being shipped around the world to the lowest bigger.  What makes the US special is that we have lots of protections like copyright, trademark, and patent protections.  We provide the best opportunities for corporations, we just have a much higher employment cost.  To circumvent high employment cost, we would either have to allow corporations to expand most around the world, increasing revenues and profits, or we have to lower our minimum wage, and other wage expectations.

Now Warren's fan club, who are finally starting to learn that ""no means no"" are splitting their vote between Hillary and Bernie, and that sounds about right. Now Hillary is starting to poll in the high 60's and low 70's. Barring a major fuck up of epic proportions, Hillary is untouchable.

There are those who will bring up how in 2008 Hillary was the presumed candidate and that she was beaten back then by Obama. Now, there's a ton of reasons why that comparison isn't appropriate not the least of which being that Hillary now has a 5 year stretch as Secretary of State under her belt. But the real reason is because at about this time Hillary was polling in the mid-30's and Obama was polling in the mid 20's with at least 2-3 other challengers of quality. Any unpartial observer would have concluded that Hilary was in a very strong position to win but was very much not untouchable.

Someone might think that all Hillary needs is strong competition. And while that might be true, it's important to remember that Hillary '08 wasn't beaten by a man -- she was beaten by a movement. Bernie Sanders doesn't have a movement; he has a fan club. That makes him a lot more like Dennis Kucinich '08 than Barack Obama '08. And her other possible future competitors (who will likely be announcing in the next week or so) have all the charisma and draw of a cold bowl of soggy oatmeal. The wonky law and order technocrat types might like O'Malley and the blue dogs might like Jim Webb and like the 4 people in Rhode Island who have heard of him will like Lincoln Chafee. But that's not a whole lot of Dems. More likely than not these guys are auditioning for Hillary's cabinet and won't be launching a serious offense.

Is Hillary beatable by a Democrat in 2016? Maybe... but the stars would have to align exactly and they just aren't.

2336,"&gt;The fact you think words like ""treason"" or ""economic suicide"" fit like a glove scares the hell out of me. Trade agreements are an important part in keeping up with the global economy. If we fall behind, it can be disastrous. Trade agreements are a necessity in the emerging markets, and they also help claim resources we need for cheap.

I might consider buying your argument if trade surpluses had resulted from Free Trade.  Tragically, the large and growing trade deficits that have only resulted from Free Trade undermine your argument since they prove that the U.S. has been losing out to Free Trade from the onset.  How is it we both look at a hollowed out U.S. economy and greatly eroded middle class, but see radically different economic results?  That is evidence of a massive economic policy failure from Free Trade, ***not*** success.  Albert Einstein once defined insanity as ""doing the same tghing over and over again while expectiung a different result"".  Economically speaking, that is precisely what Free Trade has always been in the U.S....economic insanity.

&gt;The one actual complaint I hear about TPP is that trade agreements ships jobs overseas and hurts wages. Even Bernie Sanders agrees with those. It's not true.

Bernie is right and you are mistaken on this count.  U.S. economic history proves he is right.  Look it up!

&gt;Trade agreements provide opportunities for corporations to expand into other countries. During the month of March this year, car sales by GM and Ford in China almost reached the US sales figures (443,192 vs 485,804). This could not have been done without China and the US lowering tariffs on each other.

You're glossing over the very reason that the U.S. even has trade agreements.  It is ***to benefit this country and its people***, NOT corporate shareholders who do not share their wealth and returns with the vast majority of the American people or country.  Again, U.S. trade deficits undermine your argument entirely on this count.  It should be pointed out that Ford, GM and every other multinational corporation can STILL conduct business in China without Free Trade.  They simply can't offshore their manufacturing to China, Mexico or anywhere else and sell back into the very U.S. market, they are hellbent on abandoning, without Free Trade...the real reason Free Trade exists.

&gt;To circumvent high employment cost, we would either have to allow corporations to expand most around the world, increasing revenues and profits, or we have to lower our minimum wage, and other wage expectations.

You're making a purely supply side argument here and a deeply flawed one at that.  Since you brought up the auto industry, who do you suppose would be left to buy overpriced cars without the income to do so if the labor practices you embrace were to worsen as you're proposing.  As it stands, consumer demand in the U.S. has plummeted from those labor/pay practices and there are no substitutes anywhere else in the world.

Oh, I've heard arguments that global wages will ""rise"" from globalization.  While they've definitely inched up to the point workers in Mexico and China make about 20% of U.S. workers, they will never reach what U.S. workers once made because U.S. wage levels are falling behind.  Based on the current path, the global wage equilibrium point will end up being much closer to Chinese/Mexican rates than U.S. wage rates/income levels.  How do I know this?

2337,"&gt; That IS what you said. ""Because they're fundamentally good people. I can see that in their actions."". Knowing about economics or finance isnt the same as knowing about policy and the wide reaches and impacts a policy will make. 

Sure, but they know more than you or I do.

&gt;Again, you just made up $12. So you dont actually know what the result of that is. You dont see a problem with that? You are supporting the policy, you should know the specifics.......

Just made up? No, I think a reasonable living wage is somewhere between $10 and $15 an hour. If you really want, we can go back to when wages stopped keeping up with inflation and extrapolate from that. It would probably be even higher than $15, though.

&gt;You cant repeal or leglislate out a court ruling

You can pass new legislation with the same effect.

&gt;Oh its not worth it? How do you know, lets see the math....

Let's call it an opinion. Because forcing yourself to stick in the past just to save a few jobs is fucking asinine.

&gt;Capital gains? You mean the same capital gains that joe average has on his small account? 

Is average Joe making any sort of appreciable amount, there? 

&gt;Inheritance? You mean the tax which anyone competent in estate planning can already get around? 

I mentioned closing loopholes, too, didn't I? Don't fucking ask me which ones in particular.

&gt;The tax which is actually in reality a very small issue in terms of money? Interesting place to start.

Is there a larger source of non-corporate tax I'm missing?

&gt;What gets to stay what has to leave? What projects stay what projects go? What about commitments to other countries? to the UN? Those are legally binding after all.

Uh, the people who usually make those decisions, I presume. 

&gt;Based on what analysis and metric are you measuring ""need"" ?

Based on the fact that we have a military the size of the next 9 or so nations combined and most of what we do is use that to make those who make up the military industrial complex rich.

Why have one big healthcare system waiting to fail and bring down the whole economy when you could have 50 different single payer systems? 

It's not ""too complicated"" seeing as the EU has many different single payer systems.

Why not just amend the constitution to say all people have a right to healthcare then use the power of the federal government to force states to do it? When we integrated schools we didn't create a federal school system (but a lot of idiots think we did), we just forced states to integrate.

Sanders is a senator from la-la land and he listens to his constituents. Woopty shit. His constituents are from the weirdest state in the union. There are a few small pockets across the country that share the same concerns as Vermont and they are just other versions of la-la land. 

You can't take Asheville North Carolina or Portland Oregon and declare them as a lens to American opinion without debasing your entire view point. And that means you can't take Vermont to use the same way either. Outside of those rare places it is fantasy, pure and simple. Sanders voting record is for all intents and purposes a glitch in a glitch filled system

Just one single aspect alone derails his voting record as anything more than vapor; There are more people in the city of Boston than the entire state of Vermont.

Think about that for a second. One city that can't tie its own shoes without someone getting punched in the taint or knocked up has more people than the entirety of Sanders' constituency... 

And if you think that sort of disparity has no effect on the outcomes of a candidate in national elections then you are gonna have a sad time every time. 

I love my Vermonster neighbors I really do but they are in no way any indicator of American public opinion or reality. And their politicians in the belt way are in no way an indicator of how the system works or can work.

Her platform is available.  There are 4 major points\*:

 * Build the economy (""of tomorrow not yesterday"")
 * Strengthening families and communities
 * Protect America from current and future threats
 * Getting unaccountable money out of the political system.

You guys are talking like this information isn't out there.  It is.  It's important enough that she made campaign finance reform one of her major planks.

Not that she has any more chance to do something about it than Sanders does (which is about zero).  The most important thing that happens is that Democrats continue to be elected to the White House, and continue to appoint Supreme Court judges.  Thomas and Scalia can't live forever, and unfortunately, due to gerrymandering and voter restrictions, the house is out of reach for Democrats until there's either a sea change or the courts fix it.  

Which is why it's important to nominate a Democrat that can *win the general election*.  And I hate to be the voice of reason here, but Hilary is polling well ahead of any potential Republican challenger already; whereas Sanders is polling in the ""who is that?"" zone.  I'm not in love with Clinton, but she's good enough and she can win.  Sanders is the Ted Cruz of the left - appeals to the base, throws some firebombs, and ultimately unelectable - no matter what his diehardest of fans think.

 Invest in our crumbling infrastructure with a major program to create jobs by rebuilding roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants, airports, railroads and schools.

 Transform energy systems away from fossil fuels to create jobs while beginning to reverse global warming and make the planet habitable for future generations.

 Develop new economic models to support workers in the United States instead of giving tax breaks to corporations which ship jobs to low-wage countries overseas.

 Make it easier for workers to join unions and bargain for higher wages and benefits.

 Raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour so no one who works 40 hours a week will live in poverty.

 Provide equal pay for women workers who now make 78 percent of what male counterparts make.

 
 Reform trade policies that have shuttered more than 60,000 factories and cost more than 4.9 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs.

 Make college affordable and provide affordable child care to restore Americas competitive edge compared to other nations.

 Break up big banks. The six largest banks now have assets equivalent to 61 percent of our gross domestic product, over $9.8 trillion. They underwrite more than half the mortgages in the country and issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards.

 Join the rest of the industrialized world with a Medicare-for-all health care system that provides better care at less cost.

 Expand Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and nutrition programs.

 Reform the tax code based on wage earners ability to pay and eliminate loopholes that let profitable corporations stash profits overseas and pay no U.S. federal income taxes.

These graduates are now competing in a globalized labor market that their parents simply did not have to deal with, and laborers in places like China and India are paid a tiny fraction of what our workers are paid to do similar, if not the exact same, work.

It's IMHO actually quite sustainable and what I described is a short term problem that will smooth out in the long term.  Unfortunately, this is an issue where a short term problem can be acutely painful for us, and where the long term outcome, while good for more people, is not necessarily good for us.  The question is are we willing to bear this short term pain while the rest of the world's wage levels rise to our level, and poverty levels diminish? (this is all basic economic theory, i.e. perfect competition leading all to an equilibrium point) Do we have a reason to do this, when no one is going to thank us for it?  In fact, more than likely, when other countries become just as wealthy as us, they'll also be able to field a military just as potent as ours.  Is that in our interests?

These questions are very difficult to answer.  IMHO there is no good solution, only ""less bad"" ones.  Recommend reading realpolitik literature to get an understanding of this kind of problem, although I'll warn you that realpolitik is chock-full of ""less bad"" solutions, and little to nothing that would make you feel good about politics in general.  The thing is, IMHO realpolitik asks the right questions, and asking those questions are the first step towards getting a viable solution, even if that solution is morally ambiguous at best.  A viable solution is better than a pipe dream.

&gt;""profit from that industry is more important that our long term survivability as nation.

Yeah, you've described another economic dilemma, i.e. private vs public good.  Private actors tend to ignore public good, and when that happens you get market failures that the private sector cannot correct.  You're right, if those failures remain uncorrected then the whole system goes to shit.  The thing is though, Bernie Sander's solution seems to be to nuke the private sector and turn it all public.  That brings with it a completely different set of problems.

So, I suppose what you want at this point is an explanation as those problems will be.  I believe ""deadweight loss"" is the applicable concept.

The government simply is not capable of determining optimal price levels in the economy...only a market where people can actually express their economic preferences can determine that optimal price level.

Yes/No ansers are stupid.

FOR EXAMPLE:

""Robin hood taxes"" (A term which implies taxes that are meant to take only from the extremely wealthy and give to the extremely poor) sound nice on papaer, but this particular bill ABSOLUTELY affects more than just the extremely wealthy.  

I, am NOT an extremely wealthy person.  I currently have something like $10,000 in my retirement account right now.  That retirement fund is located in ETF, whch by their very nature, make frequent, predictable, and planned out trades in order to maximize their return.

Without adding another dollar to my retirement account, due to compund interest, the measly 10k that I have in my retirement account stands to grow to something along the lines of $400,000 by the time i retire.  Now, obviously, I plan on continuing to contribute to that fund, but lets just put that aside for a moment.

a half percent fee on EVERY TRADE for a high-trading-volume ETF like the one that I hold could be potentially DEVASTATING to my retirement fund.  Since I plan on my fund being worth at least 1 million dollars by the time i retire (but hopefully more), I stand to loose HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of dollars from this tax, just from silly back of the napkin math.

Begging the question

Now that we've identified the problems, it's time to construct a response.

People listen to stories like this because our contemporary public discourse follows a pattern of political announcements followed by media and then public reactions.  The audience is expecting political grandstanding, the media is happy to portray political grandstanding, and Sanders is running for President, so he should be expected to do some political grandstanding.

The government funds our military, but the quality of our Armed Forces has not diminished to the point where they're barely any different or better than any other organized military force.  In fact, one might argue that the government-run US Armed Forces are the best-performing and most organized military force in the world.  Government funding does not destroy the things it funds.

When you address 'reddit' from a comment thread on reddit, you're addressing yourself.  By commenting, you imply that you've used your head to construct a comment, but then you admonish yourself to use your head.

Whether or not Sanders' proposal is socialist, which depends greatly on your definition of socialism, characterizing it as ""bullshit"" either means that you view all political grandstanding this way (which incites one to wonder why you're in a forum for political discussion), or that your understanding of socialism warrants a particularly derogatory tone of address towards the policy.  Either way, the comment is not substantive, and merely highlights your own thoughtless bias.

You could conversely say that Clinton ""has a policy initiative record to back it up"", referring to her time as Secretary of State.  You could also look at her voting record as a New York senator from 10 years ago.  Saying she has no prior record to infer positions from is incorrect.

In addition, Sanders is laying out his positions early, because he knows that the farthest he's going to get is the debates and the Democratic primary.  His time is much more limited than Clinton's, so he's A.) trying to get his platform out early, and B.) trying to differentiate from Clinton.  Clinton, on the other hand, can afford to play a longer, better orchestrated campaign.  Sanders is turning a necessity (getting issues out early) into a talking point (""why isn't my opponent getting their issues out early?""), but that's clever marketing - making lemonade from lemons.

And make no mistake about it: Sanders has no chance.  He is running to make sure that the issues are discussed - and it's a good thing, because his issues need discussion.

2501,"Thanks for the corrections. That is all true. Although, I disagree about Bernie not having a chance.

I feel like the only people who *really* want Hillary are the media (because they love a good Clinton headline), and the Dem/Rep political machines (because she is so ""electable/centrist, or because their entire playbook is anti-Hillary). Otherwise, she is pretty right wing and I don't know a single person (and I have a wide variety of friends) who are actually into her.

Bernie doesn't have Dem support (yet), and they will fight it. However, he does have many advantages: a record that backs his platform, and a platform most people, especially young people, agree with. He also appeals across parties (all my evidence is anecdotal on that though). He seems to be the only candidate that actually wants what the public wants. In a year where the republican candidate is almost guaranteed to be weak on issues, he is definitely electable. In terms of debating, I think it will be interesting. Clinton is good, but Bernie is pretty direct and knows his facts. I have been impressed by his every appearance. Clinton, never. And lets not forget if elected, the presidential line from 1989 onwards will look like this: Bush, Bush, Clinton, Clinton, Bush, Bush, Obama..Clinton. Doesn't sound very democratic, and I am sure everyone is waiting to bring it up. The only thing Bernie is missing is money. He's got everything else.

IMO he only has no chance if the public doesn't help him and we let the media and Dem machine define him. As a democrat and liberal, I have zero interest in Hillary. Zip. She has never done anything of note for us. She voted for Iraq when it was CLEARLY the wrong thing to do. She supports TPP. She'll probably be the same as Obama if elected. She has big money donors, and she works with and runs with that group. If elected, she is not going to do anything to fix the problems this country faces. 

Even if he is not electable I am supporting Sanders till the last day of his campaign because he actually has a lot of the same views I do and will say them on TV, unlike other politicians.

2503,"&gt;Why not, exactly? Any society I want to be a part of has a role for art historians, too. Of course, if too many people major in art history, then those people still face the risk of not finding a job in their chosen career. Obviously that's a natural deterrent that would still be present if higher education were provided by society.

I don't think the government should subsidize education for jobs that are not in demand. That doesn't mean that you can't receive federal or student loan aid to make that choice, but you should bear the risk for your choice, not the federal government. The point of subsidizing degrees for jobs in demand is to curb behavior and to convince people to study nursing instead of art history. If someone is very passionate about art history and thinks that is their calling, they are more than willing to pursue that, but taxpayers shouldn't pay for that risk. In my opinion, subsidizing education should be an investment in expanding the tax base, not a free pass to do whatever you want.

&gt;Of course not, who said otherwise?

Lots of people! Why do you think Sanders is trying to make college/university free? So that as many people as possible can attend. Other coutnries have free secondary education, but they also weed out students who aren't cut out for it.

&gt;But it sounds like you didn't get the primary point of your liberal arts education, which was to teach you not just what to think, but how to think. Plenty of art history majors go on to have rewarding careers in other fields.

Trust me, I completely understand that. But unfortunately I think the value of a liberal arts education doesn't mean much to everyone. Lots of smaller state ran schools, no offense, don't have very competent programs.

And her foreign policy chops mean little to me because she voted for the Iraq War which was clearly at the time a terrible idea; but it was popular, so she voted for it. 

I'd rather try and get the right person elected and fall back on Clinton if needed.  Sanders is quite electable, IMO, for the reasons I listed earlier.  I do believe the President can do something to fix the problems the country faces and can change the political climate.

Her planks mean nothing to me because they are not specific and she has done nothing about them. Her plank discusses income inequality but she's not doing much to stop TPP. She also wants to get money out of politics, but ""maybe would consider"" repealing Citizens United. The difference between Bernie and Hillary is one candidate has done something about their beliefs and plans to do something further, so I actually believe them. Meanwhile, Hillary isn't doing anything about her planks right now, and she is Secretary of State running for office. She may talk a good game during the primaries, but when elected, it won't stick.

I was following the last primary season. Clinton did not wow me even during debates, although she is proficient. Money is important, but money also comes and goes.

And then as for Healthcare, I mean for god sakes single payer used to be referred to as ""HillaryCare"". It was widely considered that her biggest failure as First Lady was not getting anyone on board the single payer train that she worked hard for.

And then the other comments made in that post aren't actual policy but just opinion, which you continue to get confused. Just because Clinton accepts donations from wealthy donors, doesn't mean she isn't working for policy that decrease their influence. The only difference between Clinton and Sanders is that Clinton actually stands a chance. And that chance only exists because she accepts donations from wealthy donors. Because she understands the problems she is campaigning on. She understands that the political system is broken and that the only way to turn back citizens United (a ruling made in favor of a corporate sponsored propaganda film against her... The same corporate funding that continues to tarnish her reputation...) is to accept donations that will allow her to actually win.

2560,"Well, in this case, like many of his other ideas, he actually has no plans, and is only rhetoric.

However, we can actually look at some of his other plans to ""tax the rich"" to see who he thinks the rich are. Back in February, he [proposed expanding the SS tax](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-on-congress-to-strengthen-and-expand-social-security), which would subject the top 9% of wage earners (anyone earning between 118k to 250k, to the same SS taxes as 1% salaries. So, his plans do effect many more people than the super rich. That plan actually creates a huge barrier to anyone in that salary range to move up.

Also, this current plan is only about taxing income. Most rich people don't make high incomes, any most of their wealth comes from investments. This plan would disproportionally effect people who earn money, rather than the mega rich 1%, who in effect, have compensation other than in the form of income.

So yes, if you have a business that makes, let's say 250k, which is not a lot for a small business, and are not a corporation, you are effected more than say a CEO that makes $16 million in the form of stock options, and other non income forms of compensation.

You should know that we have a progressive tax system in this country, and has been ruled by SCOTUS numerous times, that it's only allowed if the rates were fairly applied across the board to income brackets. Meaning, you can't unfairly target one bracket for higher rates, without raising the rates on the other brackets. This has been upheld several times as only being constitutional, when the Uniformity Clause isn't violated. Which means you can't specifically target one group of people for higher taxes, and raising the top bracket, would also raise every other bracket, for it to hold up to any legal scrutiny.

So, if you raise the tax brackets up for the top 1% of earners, which is ~300k, that means that the next few brackets would also raise sharply. If you look at the tax bracket history in the 40's and 50's, which is when Sanders wants to take us back to, you would see that there were 20-30 brackets, and even being in a medium income would still be above our upper tax bracket today. A top 10% wage earner in the 50's would be around 70k a year, which would be a 80% tax when the highest tax was 90%.

In order for his plan to survive any legal challenges, taxes would have to be uniformly applied across the board. Generally this has been done by putting the median income as the middle bracket, and going from there. So, in order for you to get a 90% top bracket, that means that the tax bracket for anyone making the median income (which is about 45k), would be subject from anywhere between a 40%-50%, which is more than double what the group is paying now.

While Sanders' war on the rich is a noble cause, he forgets that we are equals in this country, and you can't fairly target specific groups, without targeting all groups. This means that his tax on the rich, means more taxes across the board, and would disproportionally effect wage earners, rather than the super rich that can afford the tax, or can afford other forms of compensation, rather than worrying about paying for the mortgage.",1,0.175656565657,0.163424327281,0.470681818182,0.184419626247,0.625,0.75,581,0.0335365853659,27.6666666667,0.05,0.05

I see that bigger picture, but I'm not convinced Sanders will, in fact, do so, because I'm not convinced there are policy solutions.

&gt; The deregulation and defunding of those agencies is what allows this to happen and is very much the issue.

We actually do agree there, I went a bit too far in my counterpoint. That said, getting those changes will require a massive shift in how our society views the purpose of regulation. I'm not convinced a president is the best person to lead that argument - the president needs to govern first, not fight social battles. I think both Sanders and Warren can do more good as senators in that fight than either could in the Oval Office.

&gt; Or is it a lifestyle choice to have the same operation cost 90k in California and 4 digits in Louisiana or wherever it was?

Those are real benefits to having a single-payer system. I do not disagree. I counter that by saying those discrepancies are not the drivers of overall health care costs. ""Lifestyle choices""^1 that are common in the US (high sugar diets, high obesity rates, increase in sedentary jobs) is by [this report](http://www.aetna.com/health-reform-connection/aetnas-vision/facts-about-costs.html) and others expected to contribute some $4 trillion to US healthcare costs and productivity losses due to chronic illness (by 2023). Fixing the $3k/capita gap between the US and Norway on healthcare expenditures will not be solved by making everything cost the same across the board (prices will most likely meet somewhere in the median of the range, evening out on the whole). Instead, it will require some shift in society's attitudes towards what a healthy population can do. Frankly, I don't see any policy mechanisms that can achieve that - the US is just an unhealthy population.


My overall and entire point is not that any of the issues Sanders identifies aren't pressing concerns - it's that I don't see any effective policy solutions to them as a whole. What I see as needing to happen is a shift in how this country sees itself, and that doesn't come from the President. Sanders and Warren will be much more valuable as spokespersons for this ideal of liberalism in the Senate than they could be in the oval office.


1. From a non-medical perspective, that's an absolutely terrible phrase.

But unlike Sanders, all three are taken largely seriously by the national political press, and for good reason: They have significant bases. Paul gives a voice to libertarian-leaning conservatives, Huckabee to many evangelicals, and Cruz to some combination of the two. They dont need to win their nomination to be worth covering seriously. The same should be true for Sanders. 

This is the central argument of the article, and I think it falls flat on it's face because it ignores the actual polling data that he cited. The difference between the first and second tier of candidates is less than 5 points.

&gt; And Im no economist, but if I knew that Id be working for 90 percent of the year for free

That's not what Sanders is saying, and that's not what a 90% marginal tax rate means.

Right now income tax works as follows (I'm simplifying because it gets far more complex than it should):

For every dollar you earn up to $9,225 you pay 10% income tax

For every dollar you earn **between** $9,226 and $37,450 you pay 15%

For every dollar **between** $37,451 and $90,750 you pay 25%

and so on until the top tax bracket if you earn more than $413,201 you pay 39.6%

This means, if you earn $500,000 a year you are paying 39.6% tax only on the money between 413,201 and 500,000.  You are not paying 39.6% on all 500,000.  Your total effective rate would  actually be roughly 31% when you calculate the taxes for each bracket (10% for the first 9,000, 15% for the next 27,824 and so on.  Sanders wants to raise the tax for the top bracket back to what it was when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, which was 90%.  The very wealthy wouldn't be paying 90% on all of their money, just on the amount of money they earn over $406,000.

Personally, I think the brackets themselves would have to be adjusted if there was a 90% tax at the top, but I think this is a step in the right direction.",2,0.251731601732,0.200954540718,0.534307359307,0.3296847888,0.65,1.0,254,0.0243902439024,36.2857142857,0.294444444444,0.45

Our general election winners in Presidential years:

* Barack Obama, a Republican House, and a Democratic Senate

* Barack Obama, a fully Democratic Congress

* George W Bush, a fully Republican Congress

* George W Bush, a Republican House, and a split Senate

* Bill Clinton, a fully Republican Congress

* Bill Clinton, a fully Democratic Congress

You say one person, party, or ideology *should* win, but does that mean you think voters *should* vote a particular way?  Or are you simply saying that the real, existing preferences among voters will translate to a Democratic victory, if all other things were equal and individual voter decisions were all that mattered?

The way I see it, the voters *should* vote.  Who they vote for is irrelevant, but if it comes down to it I can see real difficulty for Sanders against:

* Jeb Bush (established name and money)

* Chris Christie (proven immunity to scandal and helpful 'connections' of questionable scruples)

* Ted Cruz (more widely recognized than Sanders, likely to have a fundraising edge)

* Bobby Jindal (more charismatic or appealing than Sanders, aesthetically)

* Rick Perry (with a noteworthy immunity to logical argument)

or

* Scott Walker (superhero-popular among neocons, already has Koch backing)

If the Republican nomination is a slugfest through April, Sanders has a chance because it's not he but Hilary who will be sized up one-by-one against the GOP contenders.  If they can settle on a nominee before there's any chance of a fight in the primaries, the Democrats will be competing against each other on their credentials as combatants of political ideology.

But you can't dismiss the question by putting up a strawman of $30 underwear.  If we made textiles from Asia that expensive, Americans would buy (and therefore, produce more) clothing made in America.  The added cost might be just pennies on every dollar.

Voting third party in a presidential election means that votes that would usually go to either party would not go to them, but to the third party. Third parties are usually not centrist, but left or right at varying extremes - so the votes they take away tend to be from one side.

This causes a spoiler vote, think 2000 George Bush election. Third party votes took away from the electoral college and gave it to the Republicans, giving George Bush the win without winning the popular vote.

On top of that, the government is rigged to run with a Republican or Democratic president. The party you are not a part of is going to constantly try to sabotage you within congress. If you are a third party, neither democrat or republican, both parties are going to be fighting against you because it is in their best interest to make your term look terrible so their party has  a better shot next term.

No, third party is a waste in presidential elections. Want to vote an independent or third party congressman or senator? Go for it, they tend to play ball with Democrats or Republicans in congress and get things done.

&gt;President Barack Obama stated that the decision ""gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washingtonwhile undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates"".[58] Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, ""this ruling strikes at our democracy itself"" and ""I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest"".[59] On January 27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, ""Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law[60] to open the floodgates for special interestsincluding foreign corporationsto spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."" On television, the camera shifted to a shot of the SCOTUS judges in the front row directly in front of the President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his head side to side while mouthing the words ""Not true"".[61][62][63][64][65][66]

&gt;Democratic senator Russ Feingold, a lead sponsor of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, stated ""This decision was a terrible mistake. Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president.""[67] Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat, stated that it was ""the worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case, and that the court had opened the door to political bribery and corruption in elections to come.[68] Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards, along with constitutional law professor and Maryland Democratic State Senator Jamie Raskin, have advocated petitions to reverse the decision by means of constitutional amendment.[69] Rep. Leonard Boswell introduced legislation to amend the constitution.[70] Senator John Kerry also called for an Amendment to overrule the decision.[71] On December 8, 2011, Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the Saving American Democracy Amendment, which would reverse the court's ruling.

The Supremes got it wrong.  Some of them (Alito) obviously never understood what it was about: power and disenfranchisement.

Naturally someone who supports the pink satin pants would try to claim that opponents ""support a rewrite of the first amendment.""


&gt; The Supreme Court reversed this decision, striking down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from making independent expenditures and ""electioneering communications"".

&gt; The United States Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by a nonprofit corporation. The principles articulated by the Supreme Court in the case have also been extended to for-profit corporations, labor unions and other associations.


All that's from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC

1.     TPP will allow corporations to outsource even more jobs overseas.	
   	
   According to the Economic Policy Institute, if the TPP is agreed to, the U.S. will lose more than 130,000 jobs to Vietnam and Japan alone.  But that is just the tip of the iceberg.	
   	
          Service Sector Jobs will be lost.  At a time when corporations have already outsourced over 3 million service sector jobs in the U.S., TPP includes rules that will make it even easier for corporate America to outsource call centers; computer programming; engineering; accounting; and medical diagnostic jobs.	
   	
          Manufacturing jobs will be lost.  As a result of NAFTA, the U.S. lost nearly 700,000 jobs.  As a result of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, the U.S. lost over 2.7 million jobs.  As a result of the Korea Free Trade Agreement, the U.S. has lost 70,000 jobs.  The TPP would make matters worse by providing special benefits to firms that offshore jobs and by reducing the risks associated with operating in low-wage countries.	
  
    
2.     U.S. sovereignty will be undermined by ... corporations... .
   	
   The TPP creates a special dispute resolution process that allows corporations to challenge any domestic laws that could adversely impact their expected future profits.	
   	
   These challenges would be heard before UN and World Bank tribunals which could require taxpayer compensation to corporations.	
   	
   This process undermines our sovereignty and subverts democratically passed laws including those dealing with labor, health, and the environment.	
   	
3.     Wages, benefits, and collective bargaining will be threatened.	
   	
   NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and other free trade agreements have helped drive down the wages and benefits of American workers and have eroded collective bargaining rights. 	
   	
   The TPP will make the race to the bottom worse because it forces American workers to compete with desperate workers in Vietnam where the minimum wage is just 56 cents an hour.	
  
 	
  
4.     Our ability to protect the environment will be undermined.	
   	
   The TPP will allow corporations to challenge any law that would adversely impact their future profits.  Pending claims worth over $14 billion have been filed based on similar language in other trade agreements.  Most of these claims deal with challenges to environmental laws in a number of countries.  The TPP will make matters even worse by giving corporations the right to sue any of the nations that sign onto the TPP.  These lawsuits would be heard in international tribunals bypassing domestic courts.	
  
 	
  
5.     Food Safety Standards will be threatened.	
   	
   The TPP would make it easier for countries like Vietnam to export contaminated fish and seafood into the U.S.  The FDA has already prevented hundreds of seafood imports from TPP countries because of salmonella, e-coli, methyl-mercury and drug residues.  But the FDA only inspects 1-2 percent of food imports and will be overwhelmed by the vast expansion of these imports if the TPP is agreed to. 	
  
 	
  
6.     Buy America laws could come to an end.	
   	
   The U.S. has several laws on the books that require the federal government to buy goods and services that are made in America or mostly made in this country.  Under TPP, foreign corporations must be given equal access to compete for these government contracts with companies that make products in America.  Under TPP, the U.S. could not even prevent companies that have horrible human rights records from receiving government contracts paid by U.S. taxpayers.	
  
 	
  
7.     Prescription prices will increase, access to life saving drugs will decrease...
   	
   Big pharmaceutical companies are working hard to ensure that the TPP extends the monopolies they have for prescription drugs by extending their patents (which currently can last 20 years or more).  This would expand the profits of big drug companies, keep drug prices artificially high, and leave millions of people around the world without access to life saving drugs.  Doctors without Borders stated that the TPP agreement is on track to become the most harmful trade pact ever for 
access to medicines in developing countries.	
  
 	
  
8.     Wall Street would benefit at the expense of everyone else.	
   	
   Under TPP, governments would be barred from imposing capital controls that have been successfully used to avoid financial crises.  These controls range from establishing a financial speculation tax to limiting the massive flows of speculative capital flowing into and out of countries responsible for the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s.  In other words, the TPP would expand the rights and power of the same Wall Street firms that nearly destroyed the world economy just five years ago and would create the conditions for more financial instability in the future.	
   	
   Last year, I co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Harkin to create a Wall Street speculation tax of just 0.03 percent on trades of derivatives, credit default swaps, and large amounts of stock.  If TPP were enacted, such a financial speculation tax may be in violation of this trade agreement.	
  
 	
  
9.      [It] would reward authoritarian regimes... that systematically violate human rights.	
   	
   The State Department, the U.S. Department of Labor, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International have all documented Vietnams widespread violations of basic international standards for human rights.  Yet, the TPP would reward Vietnams bad behavior by giving it duty free access to the U.S. market. 	
  
 	
  
10.      The TPP has no expiration date, making it virtually impossible to repeal.	
   	
   Once TPP is agreed to, it has no sunset date and could only be altered by a consensus of all of the countries that agreed to it.  Other countries, like China, could be allowed to join in the future.  For example, Canada and Mexico joined TPP negotiations in 2012 and Japan joined last year.

   Last year, I co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Harkin to create a Wall Street speculation tax of just 0.03 percent on trades of derivatives, credit default swaps, and large amounts of stock.  If TPP were enacted, such a financial speculation tax may be in violation of this trade agreement.	
  
 	
  
9.      [It] would reward authoritarian regimes... that systematically violate human rights.	
   	
   The State Department, the U.S. Department of Labor, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International have all documented Vietnams widespread violations of basic international standards for human rights.  Yet, the TPP would reward Vietnams bad behavior by giving it duty free access to the U.S. market. 	
  
 	
  
10.      The TPP has no expiration date, making it virtually impossible to repeal.	
   	
   Once TPP is agreed to, it has no sunset date and could only be altered by a consensus of all of the countries that agreed to it.  Other countries, like China, could be allowed to join in the future.  For example, Canada and Mexico joined TPP negotiations in 2012 and Japan joined last year.

Trying to pretend like following an ideology is exactly the same as following a religious faith is a really dumb and simplistic mindset. Religious doctrine can certainly *be* an ideology but pretending that agreeing that the poor shouldn't be left starving in the streets is the same as believing in a religion is just pathetic.

It's also adorable how you try to shroud your distaste towards making people's lives easier by attacking the very notion of ideology while maintaining the status quo (the definition of conservatism) is also an ideology. Funny how that works.

Class struggle is a really important thing because of Neo-Conservative policies that resulted in wasteful Middle Eastern conflicts and a global economic crash. Lone people can't create these conflicts in people's minds, they exist because they're *actually there*.

Do you really think that motherfucking Bernie Sanders made people aware of the unchecked power of the super rich? Do you really think people hold up signs that say ""Black Lives Matter"" or hold gay pride parades or feminist marches because they want to stir shit up and spend their time fighting tooth and nail for this or that stated goal or change for shits and giggles?
