That's because they are in Islam, they are all arguably Infidels in the eyes of each others. they have to implement religion into the curriculum and that's what their religion says. And you can't just remove religious studies from schools, they are so indoctrinated it will just feed into their ""evil westernization"" narrative and piss them off.

I am always so fascinated with Israel's pompous attitude on the matter. Its as if you think we don't understand that the UN and America gave you everything you needed to invade what is now your country, and then have the audacity to act as if it was smoke and mirrors and Gaza just simply came from nothing. I agree with the nation of Israel as an idea, whole heartedly would like to see it prosper, but actions do speak louder than words or ideas. 

What happens if someone is drunk in one of those buildings and asleep? What if someone is sick? Regardless, this is much more than bombings. Gaza is a wasteland, with poor sewage, little infrastructure, and a blockade blocking any supplies to rebuild at pace needed. They are forced to travel into Israel nonetheless (if they can) and are accosted by dozens of restrictive checkpoints to check their identity etc which can make going out and buying something a day's errand. I think the average Israeli poorly understands what the situation in Gaza is like, similar to how many Americans have no idea what Tijuana and South America is really like. They have never seen true poverty. Perhaps from so much experience roaming Gaza, the military does understand the situation in Gaza.

And you're right. Sadly Gaza will be a pivotal fuel in causing both Israel and the West to fight this nonsense ISIS in Iraq and Syria for at least the next 20 years, radical Jihad as a whole probably the lions share of this century.

The US has been warned by countless world leaders, journalists, analysts and experts that our policies are benefiting and creating the very same terrorists we have sworn to destroy. 

That is an undeniable irrefutable fact.

The US is not supporting secular/moderate rebels according to the testimony of the FSA's southern commander:

[""The bits of the FSA that continue to oppose Nusra and the Islamic State blame the West for their loss of power. The Syrian people will welcome any support if the West continues to abandon us, the FSAs commander for southern Syria, Abu Fadi, told me in Jordan. Abu Fadi said that, contrary to reports in the US newspapers, he had received almost no American help. None of his men had been trained in the camps that supposedly exist in Jordan. No weapons had been handed over. We have had some new boots and jackets, he said with a snort. Thats all.""](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041901/assad-now-has-the-enemy-he-wants/)

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nODxF4jOjCs) 

Additionally, a western diplomat makes the startling revelation that the vast majority of Syrian rebels are Islamist thugs:

""The official was his governments main conduit to the Syrian rebels. I asked him what percentage of the rebels western countries could support: what percentage were not jihadis, not committing human rights abuses, looting or kidnapping  and were militarily effective?""

[""There was a silence. Finally, he said: Thirty per cent. It was a devastating admission. Then he paused and said he had been considering only the first three criteria. Adding in military effectiveness, you would have to say the West could support only 10 per cent.""](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041901/assad-now-has-the-enemy-he-wants/)

Hassan Aboud of Soquor al-Sham and Abu Ayman of Ahrar al-Sham, another Islamist group, said that whoever was vetting which groups receive the weapons was doing an inadequate job.

there's the rub, you can never know that for sure.  Now i just did a bunch of reading on youths in war through history, and while many armies have used boys from the ancient Greeks to the US in WW2, at least they knew it was wrong, that it was immoral.  They did it to their shame.

87,"Okay some examples please?  
  
Here lemme give you some:  
  
* Quran 15:85: And We have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth. And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.  
  
* Quran 29:46: And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, ""We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.""
  
* Quran 22:40-42: **Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory.**
 [They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, ""Our Lord is Allah ."" And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.
[And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to Allah belongs the outcome of [all] matters.  
  
* Quran 8:37-41: Say to the Unbelievers, if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), **their past would be forgiven them**; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and **there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere**; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do. If theyrefuse, be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help. And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to Allah,- and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing,- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.    
  
* Quran 2:190: **Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.**  
  
* From the Prophet's life: After conquering Makkah from the tribe that killed his family and friends, and opressed him for years, the Prophet simply said ""You are free""  
  
* Or the fact that Muslims are prohibited from killing prisoners of war until they are tried in court. They were traditionally either let free or ransomed for money or education for the uneducated. What is ISIS doing?  
  
* Here's a great quote by Crusader Oliverus Scholasticus after losing a war to the Muslims and becoming a POW: Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God[i.e. Muslims]? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.

And I would like to point out that due to the way a number of factors have arranged themselves, it is almost impossible to portray an idea and have it escape being painted by the same brush, painting the entire middle east the same color -much like the Red Scare.

To understand the silence, you must look at recent history. For the longest time, the middle east has been getting the short end of the stick. The US's failed endeavor in Iraq is exactly what created ISIL; many people forget that. Some even speculate that ISIL was founded by foreign intelligences, and unexpectedly grew to what it is today. For too many years, you had the brutal dictators suppressing protest indiscriminately in their countries, and the populations were hopeful that the knight in shining armor, protector of the free world, America the Great, would come and save them from their misery. When no help came, they eventually reached a state of learned helplessness. When the warlords and rebel leaders fell under the influence of ISIS, only because of ISIS's battlefield advances, they brought with them order. However shitty of an order it is, it is better than free-for-all chaos -not knowing if you will survive the next hour. The people who remained have been branded as ""ISIS controlled territory"", but these people are just trying to live and feed their families. These civilians could no longer give two shits about whether Bashar is removed or not. Because the world turned its back on them, they no longer care, not about themselves, not about geopolitics. 

What does this have to do with what happened in Texas you ask? Well, due to the way the media has been portraying Islam, and due to a number of events caused by fanatic madmen, there is a very negative perception of Islam in the West. As ISIS gains territory and influence, and its propaganda spreads far and wide, its recruitment numbers goes up. They love this. Of course this has nothing to do with ""Islamic State"" and everything to do with power and money. You hear about ISIS doing really shitty things, things that somebody who feared God would never think of doing. Why? Because there is no God in the equation, and this has nothing to do with Islam. It has to do with money and power. 

Now comes along Bubba #1 and Bubba #2. I dont know about Bubba #2, but Bubba #1 is a convert to islam. Perhaps he isnt happy with his current life in Arizona. Perhaps he suffers from psychiatric problems. Who knows. He has problems. He hears about this ""Draw Muhammed"" event in TX and thinks to himself, ""shit, they cant do that to MY prophet! Im going to shoot them"" He posts on his Twitter that he is doing to do ""Jihad"" (which means struggle. You can do jihad on your toilet.. its not only violence, but thats another topic) and applies some bullshit hashtag announcing to the world his intentions. He goes to TX, shows up with Bubba #2, gets shot and dies. 

ISIS propagandists pick up his tweet and think its great, and in the interest of furthering their propaganda, they claim responsibility for this idiot's actions, and BAM all of a sudden, this random Bubba from Arizona is no longer relevant, and they just hijacked the media headlines all over the world. 

Now let me back up. Why the silence. Do you understand how the above game is unfolding? Its much bigger than me, and you, and Fred, and Bubba. Most of the Muslims living in western countries have come to realize this, due to paying attention to the recent history, and the political events that have happened in the last few years. I dont have statistics for you to satisfy the one guy whos going to comment ""post source"" but I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that the average Muslim household in America/Europe/Canada/Etc is more ""up to date"" on ""current events"" than the next guy. Shit some people on the street in America dont know who the current President is. Of those that do, few can count back 10 Presidents ago. 

There is silence because we all know, this is bullshit and there is little we can do to stop it. The more ISIS gets airtime on the media, the most this bullshit is going to happen. We can ""outcry"" all we want (and we do, you just dont see it on the news as much, because it isnt as juicy of a story) but little will change. ISIS is the new Communist. The Military Industrial Complex needed another boogeyman to perpetuate its self, and now, it is Islam. Shame really.

Also you say ""two muslims tried to cause a mass shooting""... I dunno if I agree with you there. Like I said, Bubba #1 is a convert, and God only know what kind of deranged shit has been fed to him by God knows who. 

So there. Hows that for silence? 

I do appreciate your post though.

 The fact that the fertilizer is crossing particularly through this Turkish town is the interesting bit.  The Syrian side has been controlled by ISIS for over a year.  The border which is open only for Syrians to cross is only guarded by a few border guards that are often seen wondering about.  Theres a shisha cafe on the turkish side that claimed it had regular ISIS fighters as patrons, being that smoking is haram on ISIS towns.  I've also read about a guy that had a different wife on each side of town and crossed the border everyday (probably not true but illustrates peoples perception of how penetrable the border is here)

Since middle of last year, the town has been the main point of entry for foreign ISIS members to enter Syria.. and also has a deep history as a smuggling route into Syria.  Theyve been smuggling cigarettes through here for decades.

177,"The issue here is fundamentalism. To deconstruct fundamentalism a little more, fundamentalisms are movements which coalesce around the idea that a specific orientation to a religion, is the only correct one, thus casting only the believers in a righteous light and excluding non-believers (moderate Muslims in this case) as sub-human enemies bound for Hell. Although it might be tempting to imagine that ISIS as a fundamentalist movement is oriented primarily against the West, its not. ISIS and its fellow travelers within fundamentalist Islam derive their identities more from being holier-than-thou in relation to other Muslims than to the West.  The West, is just a prop, a windmill to be charged as a display of piety. 

The bulk of ""Moderate Muslims"" as you term them, do not understand this. They merely see themselves as crappy Muslims, which, by the standards of fundamentalists, they are. The exception here is ethnically Muslim Westerners living in the West, who, to varying degrees, actually have Western values, but seek to accommodate their own ethnic and religious heritage and family obligations as we all do. These seem to be the people you are talking about. They are relatively few. It actually would be silly to ""hate"" these people. They are confused and desperately trying to accommodate fundamentally incompatible worldviews. 

ISIS is not ""trying to wedge"" anything. They are just fundamentalists, doing what fundamentalists do: casting themselves as God's favorites and condemning anyone who does not toe their line to Hell. That is it. Period. 

Your imaginary journey into the motives of ISIS is an unfortunate distraction however, when we need to be thinking about how pernicious fundamentalism in general is to human society, and how Islamic fundamentalism is *particularly* harmful, here in the West and everywhere else in the world.

Not even remotely true, you are perpetuating an untruth and a terrible strategy. Terrorist organizations tend to be full of division and bad actors. They are often held together by strong, educated, well financed leaders. If you rapidly take out enough of their top leadership, you end up splintering and fracturing the organizations as internal divisions take hold and grow. These are not the most disciplined characters in the world. 

The US decimated 'Core Al-Qaeda' by taking out it's top leaders one by one. Al-Qaeda ended up in a substantially weaker state and it splintered into sub groups without central leadership. It's ability to launch high value attacks has been severely limited. 

ISIS is even worse. Their ranks are full of criminals who lack discipline and direction without the leadership of key ruthless individuals. Taking out ISIS leadership is EXACTLY what needs to be done. You of course won't get rid of Jihadi's but you will be able to collapse the organization into something that is far more impotent and unable to easily hold territory.

You will never eradicate Jihadi's by force. You just have to keep them weak and divided. The only thing that will destroy these movements is time. Education, urbanization, social and cultural change.

""A fundamental orientation denotes a strongly pronounced return to ""true"" teachings in their historically primal form"".

Muhammad was a brutal warlord who abused religion to make people die for him, bring him 20% of the war booty (Quran 8:41), and let him gain control over the cash cow (Kaaba) in Mecca. He made it allowed by Allah to take prisoners of war (Ma malakat aymanukum) as sex slaves (Quran 4:24). ISIS is doing the same today, so it's basically fundamentalism on jihad. Most fundamentalists aren't on jihad however.

Anyway, it seems clear that ISIS is not a misinterpretation of Quran/Hadith, but simply a fundamentalist, more original interpretation.

Think about it. if you knew that your child was going to literally be tortured alive for the rest of eternity if they became a sinner, how should you treat those who try to spread corrupting influences into your community? Do you react with pluralism, tolerance, and acceptance? Taking up arms seems like a totally reasonable way to defend your community and your faith given the extreme circumstances that the enemies of God have put you in. 

Also, FYI, try reading these holy books. The Quran teaches that you should be killed for apostasy, adultery, and other crimes specified by Muhammad. The other religions teach similar things.

No...just. No. Evangelicalism includes wide swathes of Protestant Christianity. Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and more. There are about a quarter of a billion people that fall under that broad category. I think you are intending to say fundamentalist evangelicals.

Which, while also incorrect, is somewhat more plausible. Lord's Resistance Army is ""high control group"" or cult. Calling it Christian is akin to calling David Koresh's group Christian. I mean, you can do that if you want. But at some point it loses all definition.

Fundamentalist Christianity does have somewhat broader support. But it is in no way similar to ISIS, or the Taliban. I'm not saying they don't have significant issues.

In the period following the Second World War, the US has engaged in covert operations and coup attempts in Syria due to their support for Socialism and Russia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Syria

This means that the primary choice of opposition was radical Sunni Islamists due to their rejection of the inherent secularism of socialist leaning governments:

http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-s-uprising-in.../29221

This has lead to decades of violence and conflict between the Syrian government and the Sunni radicals, and terrorist attacks against Syrian Christian and Alawite minorities. The Sunnis due to their lack of political dominance in the country have instead resorted to terrorist attacks against civilians and government officials in order to oppose the secularism of the Syrian government, the government forced into a position to protect Syrian civilians has lead to increasing violence between the two factions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Syria

Unfortunately, Syria's current uprising is not secular or based on the desire for democratic reform. The majority of the Syrian protesters and rebels have always been dominated by radical Sunnis who have wanted a government based on Sharia.

Syrias uprising is not a secular one. Most participants are devout Muslims inspired by Islam. By virtue of Syrias demography most of the opposition is Sunni Muslim and often come from conservative areas.

http://foreignpolicy.com/.../islamism-and-the-syrian.../

Iraqi politicians stated numerous times that if the US backed the Syrian rebels it would destabilize Iraq, which as they called, happen exactly as they said it would.

The idea that secularists and moderates ever had a chance to be the dominate rebel military opposition in Syria is a nonsensical fantasy. -Patrick Cockburn

Additionally, a western diplomat makes the startling revelation that the vast majority of Syrian rebels are Islamist thugs:

""The official was his governments main conduit to the Syrian rebels. I asked him what percentage of the rebels western countries could support: what percentage were not jihadis, not committing human rights abuses, looting or kidnapping  and were militarily effective?""

[""There was a silence. Finally, he said: Thirty per cent. It was a devastating admission. Then he paused and said he had been considering only the first three criteria.

Just turn the oil economy on its head and hurt millions of lives through turmoil by ending it overnight? No, that's irresponsible so you need to try to first end your energy reliance on them. The way to do this is to look 2 fold at first how much oil you can produce domestically though investment in things like offshore drilling or shale and secondly to bring other emerging technologies onto the main stage like solar. 

I'm just saying, a lot of people pretend as if it's some great hypocrisy that the U.S. is allied with S.A. but really it's more like having an unsavory amoral uncle that your embarrassed you know but is your only good source of gas, and you need gas to get to work in the morning. 

The U.S. needs Saudi right now and the big domestic support of fracking and shale despite some potential environmental consequences is due to the need to de-fund Saudi; it's ironic if you think about it, environmentalists are really helping terrorism through hurting domestic energy efforts and slowing our weening from Saudi's tit. Every dollar worth of oil sent to the Saudi's helps then reinforce their Islamic theocracy based on Wahhabism which is the ideology that all the bad guys like Osama and ISIS are all about. 

This sheds some context on why the Saudis are desperately dropping the bottom out of oil to stop both emerging domestic sources and alternative energies. When you've got a lot of something you want to raise the price as high as possible but not to the point that your addicted customers look for alternatives. S.A. got greedy and allowed U.S. shale to exist by $60+ barrels. At $35 barrels, shale doesn't exist and even R and D companies like Tesla struggle. Saudi wants this

I can understand why you think it might be relevant, but I believe it to be completely irrelevant. I also object to the framing of this issue. This is about refusing to do an immoral act, no matter what the consequences. It is ISIS that then decides to slaughter your entire family. 

The father doesn't have the right to sacrifice his daughter to 'save' the rest of his family. 

&gt; If not, then it's much harder to justify letting everyone die or one person live a life where they wish they were dead. What does everyone dying accomplish?

Let me ask you something. Suppose you had 6 children, and ISIS told you that they would let one live, if you would behead the other 5 yourself. Would you do it?

People and comments like this are what is wrong with society generally and reddit specifically. Anyone wanting to run away from ISIS should be encouraged and anyone running embraced.

The conflict in the middle east and in the world generally is fueled by poverty, ignorance, desperation, and fanciful idealism. To act like teen girls from britain joined ISIS or wished to join ISIS for the express purpose of raping babies is ludicrous and goes to show your own perverted state of mind, and the minds of those who find agreement with your sentiments. 

Most people who see negative coverage of ISIS assume it is merely western propoganda. Are they going to believe the western media when the western powers have spent the past two decades dropping more bombs in the middle east than have been dropped in history up to that point? What about the 500,000 children that the Clinton administration helped kill in Iraq with all of their glorious freedom loving bombs?

The West discredited itself with huge segments of every population int he world capable of paying attention. It is not unreasonable for them to assume that the words of ISIS leaders are legitimate and a new world, a new *just* world exists and that is what ISIS fights for. Or maybe as children and teenagers sometimes do, they want adventure and excitement without a conception of the cost and consequences. I have worked in the field of mental health including children and the very idea that these people should be tortured by ISIS for your own amusement is as ridiculous as it is disgusting. Quite a feat for you there. 

Perhaps you and the rest of the ISIS critics could do something about Western powers toppling Governments and arming extremists so that they may carry out their horrific crimes before you so joyously celebrate the rape and torture of the 'right people'.

That's a bastardized paraphrasing of what the law and science say.

Yes, they can be aware at an intellectual level that ISIS has committed atrocities.  Yes, they know that they are allying themselves with these people.

The reason there are laws to protect minors is because the [human brain does not fully mature until around age 25.](http://hrweb.mit.edu/worklife/youngadult/brain.html)

It is particularly believed that the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with planning, problem-solving, and related tasks, is not fully developed which can hinder responsible decision-making.

So at a biological level, they can be considered physiologically and psychologically hindered in making rational decisions.

Nobody is saying ""16 year olds don't know that murder is wrong.""  Almost any child knows that.  It's that the part of the brain that normally jumps in and says, ""Hey, we shouldn't murder this guy"" isn't fully developed, so many believe that it is unethical to try these people the same as fully matured adults in many cases.  The former example is knowledge of morality, while the latter is moral regulation of one's actions.

And all of that is without even taking into consideration how much more malleable and easily influenced a teenager is.  An authority figure or loved one can hold significant influence over younger people who don't have the life experience to compare against what they're being told.


That being said, I have no sympathy for these girls and they should be punished.  It's not like this was a crime of passion or anything like that, they made a calculated decision to join a group associated with heinous crimes against humanity.

Who's to say they're not training these ""poor innocent girls"" to make and spread poisons, or to use social media to influence opinion from a domestic standpoint and among people who they actually know?

If this story is true then the girls need to be investigated thoroughly to ascertain whether they committed crimes and dealt with accordingly.

My Idea of (x) Cells is not that of the TV.
Take a dive into any of the Dark nets and you will see training in the types of disciplines you describe taking place left and right - along with a whole caboodle of other nefarious things.

My point is, to be a realistic terror 'cell' you must operate with some subterfuge and decorum.

Once contact is made get them to download and execute a file to establish secure comms to a darknet relay (this would be with a one time pad algorithm, obviously)  from there you have untraceable communication.  (this is happening for sure, you can see people drop off standard forums after such a request) From here you can send them a GPS tracked pre-paid Android phone* with a different encryption pad and a vanilla OS.   From here you can setup a couple of local meets with throw away juniors of different cells who don't know anything to ensure their offer of compliance is legitimate.**   Feed nefarious data and skills and hope for the best - link ups with other minor cells for hands on stuff if necessary.  Create minor theaters for them to test their skills (Stink bombs on the Metro, lasers on autobahn junctions, whatever)

Then send you them the info for the money shot.  

Luckily British intelligence is pretty hot on the above mentioned scene, and more and will wait until now to pounce generally.

What you don't do, is drag them through the borders, through the media and through the inevitable constant surveillance.

Unless: 
a) It's a deliberate (and futile) attempt to waste the resources of Great Britain  
or b) They are stupid scared little girls who's life and outlook on life will be forever changed.

I'm going with b. And I wish them the best.  Stupid 16 year olds with stupid friends.  If they manage to live through this, they may contribute to things.

Let alone the fact that Iran's *government* (which is important) supports many terrorist organizations, said multiple times they want to annihilate Israel, are holocaust deniers, said they want to destroy the US, are hanging people in public squares for various crimes etc. etc.

We will never defeat an enemy we do not understand. We will never defeat an enemy that we continue to play into the hand of.

ISIS is an interesting mutation of terror organizations in the Middle East as they are the first (at least in the last couple decades) to legitimately pursue statecraft. Keep in mind, they're primary motivation of taking the battle from Syria to Iraq is their refusal to recognize the [Sykes-Picot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) agreement. This has been made explicit by ISIS. 

It is also important to remember that ISIS is not made up of bloodthirsty barbarians looting and pillaging the desert haphazardly. They are calculated. They know their enemy. The reason they behead journalists is because they know it disgusts the West. It makes you feel. To make you FEEL vehemently is exactly what they intend to do. When you are angry, disgusted, vindictive, you make emotional decisions instead of calculated ones. This is exactly what is happening to Jordan right now. They are getting more and more invested in a fight that has the potential to ignite a growing [refugee crisis](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/jordans-quiet-emergency/374803/). Notice it's never a well-adjusted middle class suburban kid who joins ISIS. It is routinely the isolated and disenfranchised.

So I implore you, as a matter of national security, go out and meet a Muslim. Discuss Hijab with a woman choosing to wear one. Ask a Muslim what Muhammad says about peace. Ask how their religion informs their life on a daily basis. If we are going to value diversity, we need to take a hard look at the degree to which we self-segregate.

The Hadith has pearls of wisdom like this

(715)Chapter: Regarding 'Azl (Withdrawing Before Ejaculation)(49)     

Muhairiz said I entered the mosque and saw Abu Said Al Khudri . I sat with him and asked about withdrawing the penis (while having intercourse). Abu Said said We went out with the Apostle of Allaah() on the expedition to Banu Al Mustaliq and took some Arab women captive and we desired the women for we were suffering from the absence of our wives and we wanted ransom, so we intended to withdraw the penis (while having intercourse with the slave women). But we asked ourselves can we draw the penis when the Apostle of Allaah() is among us before asking him about it? So we asked him about it. He said it does not matter if you do not do it, for very soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

                                                                                  ""                "" .

There is a warning of a potential terrorist attack and we have responses like =&gt;

|""Well when you consider ISIS is an artificially generated, military industrial complex sponsored,""

Upvoted? Seriously what drugs or religion are you people on? Given the past, yes it is likely that there will be more Islamic terrorism in Australia.  Intelligence services pick up this and publish it because that is what they are paid too do. However so many here are obsessed with political overtone despite the constant string of attacks and attempted attacks against various western countries in the past several  years. Looking at the complete mess that is the middle east, it is likely to continue. The more successful attacks there are the far more restrictive and over seeing will spy agencies become and yet all people here can do, when attacks are occurring in a repeatable manner is complain specifically about such warnings. If you are blaming restrictive laws on our government instead of issues with an ancient religion I think you have misplaced the root cause.

Now if intelligence services do not act then it is likely that more attacks would be successful thus escalating problems even further as well as the restrictive laws. We have a religion that generates and empowers extremist to the point that what was once the cradle of modern civilization is now a mess beyond description and yet all people can come up with here is: 

|""Well when you consider ISIS is an artificially generated, military industrial complex sponsored,""

An entire region of multiple countries have all ended up in a total mess and are largely unable to exit that mess due to extremist being empowered in those countries as a function of Islam, a pattern which is fairly replicable across Islamic countries around the world and through various time periods regardless of outside interaction.  It is to the point that its effectively a statistical ensemble.  If we want to maintain multiculturalism without specifically dealing with the issues around Islam due to the taboo of political correctness then it is likely that we will incurr more restrictive laws to prevent terrorism as the population responds to the threat of bombings and beheading and similar. In this manner the mass population(average sheeple) and how they react will lead to this later.

Remember, agencies that give these warnings generally don't want too. Each time they give a warning and nothing occurs they look bad.  Whats more, for the people working at those agencies it means more work and more overtime resolving associated issues instead of going home to their families.

I find it quiet interesting, that this subreddit, instead of looking at the root cause, which as 99% of large scale terrorist cases happen to be closely related to islam, rather look at a government and people trying to respond to that threat and minimize the impact. Yet in leaning this subreddit, leans to the left, which tends to science like and against things like ""religous chaplains in school"", and supportive of vaccinations. Islam however on average tends to empower people who are far more to the right and extreme of ""religions in school"" and being against vaccinations as is seen in many examples in the middle east. Yet so many here avoid that obvious link in contradiction with the values they display.

Yes it can argued that we, as part of the west are part of the stabilization of the middle east.  However part of that problem, is that Islam empower those with extreme ideals in those countries. Due to its ability to empower those who are extreme, it weakens the societal fabric that makes those countries very fragile and easy targets.
It has in effect made them easy targets for our corrupt and thus our implication.

I would argue that the following is likely, and not really a choice, but more likely a statistical outcome that is probable regardless of who is in power:

1.There will likely be more terrorist attacks associated with Islam. It is likely that Islam, as a function of its own contradictions within the world for which we live, will always lead to a small percentage of its follower engaging in very undesirable behavior such as terrorism.  In the case of countries where it is significantly dominant, those countries are likely to have instability regardless of outside influences as a function of the issues with islam.

2.Non islamic countries, as a response to terrorist attacks will have their populations demand more action from governments over time.  They see an obvious and simple threat to their daily lives on average and will demand action. Governments that get into power will oblige. We as a result will loose freedoms.

I would argue some of this may be mitigated by:

3.If a dialog is started, openly non aggressively, from the LEFT, that there are problems with Islam that need to be changed in order for it to be compatible with modern **multicultural society** then their is a chance that we may reduce terrorism to the point that it becomes ""insignificant in the publics eye"" and we can start increasing our freedoms as we should.The line of dialog should be along that there is a small percent of people from islamic backgrounds, as a function of islam, that are empowered by islam to do terrorism is an unacceptable percentage as compared to those from other value systems and as a result islam needs to change in order for its followers to meet standards such that its followers commit terrorist attacks at a rate that is in line with the rest of the population.

I would also argue that this line of dialog will not work, as it is now, where only right by enlarge criticizes the issue with the religion and that is because the right on average tends to be overly aggressive with the deport them or hang them all argument.

4.In order to reduce short term impacts, the west in general needs a longer term discussion about weather its proactive interventionist policy in middle eastern countries is correct.  Should we adopt a stance similar to china's no interference policy? Should if we intervene, such as the US in iraq, be required to stay in order to ensure that said country does not deteriorate into a worse mess in such way as to take responsibility for our past actions?  Perhaps we also need to work on a system of accountability for our politicians which currently seems to be lacking.

The fact that you, in 2015, choose to ignore this and act like it's not part of your religion does not infact remove it from the Qu'ran.

I don't know why I bring this up specifically, except to say we have a lot of rules and notes on interpretation of Qur'an. You can't just extract a line from it. You're reading a translation of a work of poetry. For one thing, it'll sound horribly wrong. Secondly, there are so many hafiz or people that have read the book hundreds of time, that you'll get called out on it immediately. My grandmother, for example, can hear a line of Qur'an and tell you the next few lines verbatim, she'll know the context and the surah (chapter), she'll know if you changed *one letter*, and she's certainly not exceptional. We read this book religiously, repeatedly. We read through the entire thing every time a loved one dies. Our prayers consist of the first chapter of the book (17x daily obligatory), plus 17 other chapters of the book daily (usually we pick the short ones!). The reason I bring up the Christians is not to rant, but just to point out : this is not the equivalent of citing the Bible, it's entirely different.

This in a point of view of a person that grew majority of his life in US and childhood in rural Bangladesh under fairly devoted moderate muslim parents, and I only saying this as other areas of people may question explanation. Anyway, When I was growing up, my parents did the typical thing every muslim parents do, which is to send their kid to madrasa (religious teaching school - equivalent to Sunday school) where they would tech all the kids how to read Arabic and recite the Quran. Its a hard thing to read if your native tongue in not that language. throughout all the teaching, there one thing that always stuck, which was a question, how will we know when day of judgement come. There are quite few narrative written about it, some with fairly strong chain of narration, some with weak. So we know that major part of Quran just repeats the stories in the bible or torah, which are all about War that was conducted and called upon by God, so you can see how it is perceived that the definition of religious life boils down to struggle. So the violent nature of the book really does dawn upon the people who are trained to never question it. skipping fast forward a question is asked to muhhamed about how his followers will know day of judgement will come, the signs are as follows:

1. Death of Mohammed - pretty self explanatory, when he does, things start falling apart and god starts the time clock on the end of the world.
2. Fire in the west - this was rather a vague sign but scholars have sometimes described as an actual fire and other time as turmoil in the west which lot of the uneducated muslims relate to the current arab world struggle with the west occupying their country and space which creates anger.

skipping few minor signs (in my opinion)

one of the last one is the last struggle. This is suppose to be a fight between believers and non-believers. This story relates to the coming of the messiah and reincarnation of Jesus. The story boils down Jesus being the savior (muslim's believe he will return as a follower of Mohammed and not as a Christian). The story portrays and ending with the believers winning and living in peace amongst each other. What ISIS is doing is reiterating this fictional story that almost every child around me learned and saying that the time is here. We need to fight for our religion and get to the peace.

I left out lot of the story as it can get very long to discuss in detail but hopefully you get the picture why these assholes say is the religion of fighting against infedels. It also doesn't help that the Quran mentions a struggle that happened during Mohammed's time when he was conquering Mecca. I can tell the story if you want to hear it.

Just because acts are carried out in the name of Islam, doesn't mean that they were motivated by it. I could blow myself up in the name of Reddit, yet nobody would blame Reddit. Suicide is explicitly forbidden in Islam yet suicide bombings are the goto tactic for terrorist organizations.

We should really consider the social, economic and political issues facing the Muslim world when trying to explain why the Middle East is a disproportionately violent place. In the case of Islamic terrorism, acts committed in the 'name of Islam' tend to have a very clear political motivation. No major terrorist organization in the Muslim world has been grounded solely on the grounds of ideology. Al-Qaeda was founded during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and recruited from all over the Middle East by portraying the conflict as a religious struggle.

These organizations use twisted Islamic rhetoric as a means to compel their followers. This makes strategic sense for terrorist organizations because if people believe that the atrocities they commit are in line with certain religious principles they are more likely to act. Violence is a product of observable factors like power struggles and oppression; not ideologies like Islam that are completely open to ones interpretation.

I just don't understand how they think *any* god would want them after all they've done and continue to do. After reading this from they wikipedia article for Devil(Islam)

*""The primary characteristic of the Devil is hubris.[2] His primary activity is to incite humans and jinn to commit evil through deception, which is referred to as ""whispering into the hearts"".[3] The Quran mentions that Satans are the assistants of those who disbelieve in God: ""We have made the evil ones friends to those without faith.""[4]""*

I wonder if their motivations are actually evil, and they (ISIS) are liars about their faith. They definitely ""whisper into the hearts"" of people they recruit. They manage to convince them that Islams god is okay with raping children (does the reason matter?), among other things most religions would consider entirely evil and without justification.  

Personally, I have emotions sometimes that make me want to denounce all of Islam as a bad religion that has no place in the future, if humanity is ever going to find peace. But that is wrong, ISIS does what they do with the intent of making me and the rest of the non-Islamic world feel that way.I think they have perverted, and twisted your religion for this. I may never understand how they find that acceptable. It's perplexing to think about.

I believe your message is shared by the vast majority of Islamic peoples. My rational mind manages to push out narrow minded emotions. If anything, I'm interested in such a controversial religion that walks such a fine line in peoples minds. In the western world we grow up with images of religious figures being white, all media depicts Noah, Adam, Jesus, Moses as an ethnicity they just couldn't have been. Until ISIS made me wonder why they thought it was okay to do they things they do, I had no idea how closely tied Christianity and Islam are, historically.

We should really consider the social, economic and political issues facing the Muslim world when trying to explain why the Middle East is a disproportionately violent place. In the case of Islamic terrorism, acts committed in the 'name of Islam' tend to have a very clear political motivation. No major terrorist organization in the Muslim world has been grounded solely on the grounds of ideology. Al-Qaeda was founded during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and recruited from all over the Middle East by portraying the conflict as a religious struggle.

These organizations use twisted Islamic rhetoric as a means to compel their followers. This makes strategic sense for terrorist organizations because if people believe that the atrocities they commit are in line with certain religious principles they are more likely to act. Violence is a product of observable factors like power struggles and oppression; not ideologies like Islam that are completely open to ones interpretation.

As far as I know, this is not true. Do you have a reference of some kind? No militant groups held territory as far as I know. They existed and of course being something that exists they existed at some place or another but they were underground. They may have even declared what they believed their territory to be but held less actual control over it than a mafia gang holds over some neighborhood they say they control.

They also don't go around and arrest hundreds of people without any reason and then refuse to tell us where they're being detained.

&gt;We are not anywhere close to killing a leader every 4-5 weeks.

I didn't say leader; I said senior management. And yes, senior ISIS members are killed on a regular basis. The point I was making here is that management attrition is detrimental to an organization's ability to function in a coherent manner. This is not a controversial point to make and I'd challenge you to find me a respectable source that supports the notion that organizations do not suffer from a regular loss of leadership.

&gt;Look at early christianity. MASSIVE persecuation by the strongest empire on earth (Rome). Did that get rid of christians?
Look at the entire history of islam. constant internecine battle. did it end them? no.

Read my post again, I specifically acknowledged that leadership decapitation does not end terrorist networks or defeat the ideology from which they have grown. My argument is not that killing leaders will destroy the network; my argument is that leadership decapitation produces operational hindrances and reduces the effectiveness of the network.

&gt;Its a very foolish to buy into the western simplistic propoganda (DIRECTED AT US IN THE WEST) that these people are ""just terrorists"". Thats not even remotely how they percieve themselves. They see themselves as 100000% muslims religious crusaders, not as ""an organization"" as we see them in the west.

The fact that they have particular motives or a particular self-image does not change the fact that terrorist networks are organizations of people. They have finances, a chain of command, recruitment practices, and objectives. 

&gt;Did we end ""terrorism"" when we killed bin laden? no. Its WORSE today. Did we end it when we killed zarkawi? No, its WORSE.

No, we didn't, and that's not what I'm arguing.

My point is not that dismantling an organization will end terrorism or even a particular terrorist network. I am arguing that terrorist organizations are far more dangerous when they have competent, coherent leadership structures. The al-Qa'ida of the late 1990s/early 2000s brought us the African embassy bombings, the USS Cole attack, and 9/11. These were all high-casualty, highly effective operations conducted with rigorous planning, training, and financing. Terrorist networks without effective leadership are far less capable of conducting these kinds of operations due to failures of organizational management. The disaggregation of al-Qa'ida after 2001 rendered it incapable of conducting attacks that were even remotely close to their previous efforts. Just because they still exist does not mean they haven't suffered from the deaths of their leadership. It's generally accepted within terrorism and political violence scholarship that AQ Central (its original formulation) no longer exists in any meaningful capacity.

You seem to have the ""Battle(s) of Fallujah"" confused with the invasion. The Iraqi Army melted away in front of the U.S. invasion force and surrendered after 2 weeks of fighting from 19 March to 1 May 2003. The city of Fallujah was pro-American and secure so there was very little U.S. forces there. After former Baathist and foreign fighters infiltrated the city the 1st and 2nd Battles of Fallujah commenced. 1st (early 2004) Battle was 2,200 U.S. troops vs 3,600 insurgents with 27 U.S. casualties. 2nd (late 2004) Battle was 10,000 U.S. troops vs 4,000 Insurgents with 95 U.S. casualties. 

You are also confusing the ""paid immense amounts of money to the defending generals"" with the ""Sons of Iraq"" Sunni tribal leaders that General Petraeus bought out to leave the insurgency at a much later date.

You are also confused with ""Then after the war the USA went back on the immigration deals with these generals and abandoned them and cast them out of the new army and power structure."" 

There was never, ever, not in a million years going to be insurgents immigrating to the U.S. -I don't where you get this shit from. Also it was Maliki who pissed off the ""Sons of Iraq"" (active 2005- 2013) by purging the Sunni from the government/Armed Forces after the U.S. left.

Well, the poorest countries don't. And as you yourself said, these countries ain't exactly stable (which is probably why they are so poor) so they should be spewing ISIS recruits from every orifice.

Meanwhile EU nations are both rich AND stable and they have generated thousands of ISIS recruits.

Think of an old saying: Idle hands are the devils plaything.

Then look at the list again. The biggest source of terrorists are those nations where there are idle hands.

Libya is a prime example. The country wasn't exactly poor nor unstable under Ghadaffi. But it had many idle hands, educated young people sitting at home with benefits because there weren't enough jobs. Then the restraint was released and the country has exploded into a cesspit of terrorism. 

In truly poor countries, the people are to busy just surviving to listen to hate preachers. Notice how few of the western ISIS recruits were active members of society. Most were unemployed, giving them plenty of time to radicalize. 

That's the secret, you can't just blame financial poverty. Because the fact that many of the western recruits were not poor by any means.

But far more of them were idle rich (middle class), not self made rich but their parents made it and they lived of it.

And then you can start looking at western/white terrorism and drag in cults and wow! Suddenly we have a ton of research that matches perfect. Idle spoiled rich (as in not having to work for a living not in them being millionaires) kids looking for a goal in life. That is the western ISIS recruits.

Not sure how linking to me to a random song that exists about a historical thing that happened (with ""the art of history"" actually written clearly on it) actually supports whatever it is you're saying.

You read like the ramblings of a madman, with these apparent delusions about this christians vs muslims holy war that's going on with all these knights riding around in the middle east singing to brass bands. This isn't a thing that happens.

What has actually happened is time moved on, the world moved on, other big events happened across hundreds and hundreds of years and through eras, and many generations lived and died, and humanity is now a much more mature species, with a (believe it or not) much more peaceful planet. There are populations of people who are unfortunate enough to live in a part of the world strife with war, dictatorships and religious extremism. ISIS are a group on a religious war against all religion that is not theirs, not just against christians.

You can't blame christianity for the state of the middle east. The middle east has always been a war torn zone - before islam or christianity were even an idea. Look at the Assyrian empire, Egyptian dynasties, the Macedonians, the Selucids, the Romans, the Timurids, the Mongols, various city states, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on. War, invasions, genocide, etc.

Just do yourself a favour and step back, and realise that there isn't a 'side' that you have to take.

Welfare may make some aspects of becoming a jihadist easier. It could provide people with more free time to study the teachings of radical clerics. It could also assist in some of the travel costs. But it's possible the money could be sourced from other places such as shady charity organisations and unknowing family members.

I don't think you have shown a strong causal link between welfare and jihad, in fact you've barely demonstrated a correlation. 

With respects to ISIS and anti-western propaganda. As I'm sure you know, ISIS is an offshoot of Al Qaeda's Iraq branch. So one should expect anti-western propaganda given their pedigree. This has increased in frequency with the entry of western and regional powers into the conflict. Al Qaeda was created largely as a reaction to the close relationship between 'heretical' Arab states and America, so the joint aerial campaign must annoy ISIS to no end.

In any event, my main point was that young men who join ISIS and Al-Nusra don't see themselves as evil. These young men left europe driven by a confessionalistic passion to defend their fellow Sunnis. They aren't blowing up buses in downtown Copenhagen, they're manning the frontlines of a war they see as protecting their co-religious. I don't see how you can discourage people empowered by such righteousness with solutions such as suspending welfare payments or other simple solutions.

One of the reasons I think ISIS has been so much more successful in recruiting than Al Qaeda is that ISIS has a far more visceral call to arms. Al Qaeda dealt in abstractions in explaining how America was oppressing muslims around the world. It was a very esoteric argument that only found very few supporters amongst muslims.

Obama's strategy is sound - he still attacks and cripples ISIS with surgical strikes when needed, while not overcomitting.

1048,"&gt;The official positions of both the PLO and Israel is that they want a two-state solution and both have been willing to negotiate towards a solution. What you are suggesting is that the international community override whatever the parties to the dispute want. How will that solve the problem if the stakeholders have no say?

Your reading comprehension is terrible. I said both states have to be involved in the solution, explicitly.

Words are but wind. Both sides claim to be open to the 2 state solution but Netanyahu has made it abundantly clear he is not. Particularly with the recent appointment of Ayalet Shaked who literally called for the Genocide of palestinian mothers.

It goes without saying that many of the Palestinian pre-conditions for negotiation have been completely unconstructive and impossible to meet. 

&gt;I only disdain international recognition where it's based on politics, not reality, and runs in the face of international law. And the 1948 agreement was entirely correct. It had a defined boundary, defined governments, and defined populations. It abided by the rules. Yes, the lines were drawn by someone else, but with the acquiescence of the population (at least in Israel's case), and unlike Sykes-Picot were done after considerable study and not based on imperialist political aspirations.

The 1948 borders would be fine in my eyes, and in the eys of international law. I'd prefer a more up-to-date solution with the same kind of comprehensive investigation that enshrined the first. However do you deny that Netanyahu is clearly not interested in appeasement or diplomacy?



*Incidentally, all this talk of defining the population is moot*, in the study of International relations defining a population is secondary to simply controlling the territory and population.  Here's an excerpt of David Kilcullen, a distinguished academic with a focus on ISIS and the middle east talking about what defines statehood with concern to ISIS:

&gt; Well, without getting too geeky about it, in international relations we normally say that a state needs to have four characteristics. It needs to control the territory, it needs to control the population, it has to have a government that exercises some form of control and it has to be capable of entering into relations with other states. So if we look at all four of those, right now, ISIS controls an area about the size of the Netherlands or Switzerland, slightly larger, about a third of both Iraq and Syria. As it's lost ground in Iraq and of course recently regained ground, it has also gained ground in Syria. It has a population under its control about the size of Israel or Norway or Singapore. It has a government that is not just military people; it has a taxation system and a court system, police, it runs electrical power, water - all those kinds of things in the cities that it controls. And then finally, it sells electricity to the Syrian Government, it trades oil and antiquities on the international market, it has an international spokesman and an international support network. So it doesn't - it's not a requirement in our understanding of what a state is that it should actually be recognised by other states and of course Islamic State is not recognised by any other state.

So the primary problem with a Palestinian state is that the PA does not control Gaza, and cannot control the militants and miltia who are governed by Hamas. Asides from this, Palestine under the PA in theory meet all these criteria. The PA is open (though somewhat intractable) on what they believe is there's, they have external links, and they have shown in the past the ability to govern and continue to govern some territories to this day.

Israel could choose to empower the PA, if it wished, rather than follow this bloody status quo.

&gt;Actually most of them aren't. They were born into the refugee 'camps', which are really cities, in countries like Lebanon and Syria.

Born there because their parents are refugees. That makes them Palestinian refugees. They do not get automatic citizenship from Lebanon or Syria.

&gt;Are we including the ones in camps in the Middle East or the ones further afield? How many generations do we include? Are there any other requirements? These are questions that need to be answered before a projected Palestinian population can be ascertained

Indeed however what you're suggesting is that because these questions need an answer, we should just not answer them at all and stick with the status quo.

&gt;Israel doesn't object to Palestinians moving to a new Palestinian state, and that's not the issue here

You asked what the population of this state would be asking me if refugees would return. I simply said ""Let's say yes, because it'd be hypocritical to for Israel to oppose that idea"".

&gt;I am not, and have never claimed that there is no such thing as the Palestinian people. My issue is that there is no defined population for the purposes of statehood, which is a requirement under international law.

This could be corrected within a few hours if you had people around the table. All the numbers exist and this is a trivial matter for lawyers, economists and assorted social scientists. 

Constructive dialogue like what you and I are having do not feature in any of the negotiations or peace-talks. I do not exclusively blame Israel, both the Israeli government and various PA/Fatah/Hamas in the past have all engaged in fierce rhetoric to gain support at home that sabotaged negotations.

I don't think you were proven right. I think that allowing a superior fighting force to regroup, rearm, recruit and plan for 4 years on how they will invade Iraq is not the same as the place just falling apart after the US left. ISIS is not a civil war issue, or a new issue, it's the same enemy that you engaged. But rather than destroy that enemy, we allowed them safehavens. There would be no issue if the US and UK and any other countries continued the policy of leaving no safe haven for terrorists. But they didn't. They declared it was no longer our job, Syria was magically off limits until 2014 when ISIS invaded and the press and the people of the US and the west looked at their governments and demanded they do something. So we did. We started bombing again. We continued arming untrained and unaccountable militias. And so far, peace is no where on the horizon. Instead, ISIS is dragging those unpatriotic military and police force members from their homes and executing them in Rahmadi.

&gt;Nevertheless, doing something just for the sake of doing something, without any real hope of ultimate success, is pointless.

I couldn't agree with you more here. That is my entire point about using untrained and unaccountable troops and having no stated plan to stop the enemy.

We've been bombing ISIS in Iraq and SYria for a year now - I have no idea what the end game is other than keep dropping bombs, supplying weapons, and hoping for peace to break out. Do you?

You claim that you had no mission in Iraq, but it seems to me you clearly did; to help restore order to Iraq after removing Saddam. You participated in securing the first ellections in that country in 35+ years. I'm not sure why that doesn't bring you extreme pride and answer the mission question for you.

And the ""democratically elected government?"" Government of the Shiites, by the Shiites, and for the Shiites. No, I'm not proud that I helped to provide a facade of legitimacy to a regime that deliberately oppresses a huge portion of the population. Democracy isn't magic, it is not an inherent good in itself, and it shouldn't be a surprise that it makes a mockery of itself in a country torn apart by ethnic hatred, and in which nearly a quarter of the population can't even read.

And the ""bases"" ISIS has in Syria and Iraq are first and foremost the homes and hearts of its sympathizers in Syria and Iraq. You keep going on about ""finishing the job"", as if there is a job here for our military. There is not. The presence of Western militaries in Iraq and Syria will do nothing more than extend the instability and chaos far into the future. You continue to promote military action, but you haven't bothered to establish how military action will lead to peace and stability in the region. At most, we can maintain some semblance of order while we occupy the place, but our presence can only promote and spread ISIL's ""bases"" in the region, because those bases have no physical existence and ultimately cannot be attacked by an army.

There is some hope, in the long term. The Kurds are capable of at least holding their own region, the majority Shiite areas will never be fertile ground for ISIS recruiting, and Assad's government in Syria is, whatever its faults, a formidable opponent of ISIS. If we grant some support to these groups, eventually ISIS will fade into insignificance.  Their activities depend on support and financing from outside, and there is no guarantee that they will continue to receive this. The longer the conflict continues, the harder it will be for them to dredge up funds. They live on propaganda, and propaganda becomes more and more difficult when there is no apparent progress to speak of, and no Evil Empire around to point to. But the presence of Western militaries in Iraq or Syria would provide them with an enormously powerful propaganda weapon. It isn't just that military action wouldn't be useful; it would actually make the problem worse. This situation will take years, probably even decades to resolve itself. That's true no matter what we do, and we should probably get used to that idea.

The harsh truth is that the West needs the energy security of keeping the major ME OPEC exporters on side who are promoting sectarian violence as a means to counter Shia influence and this means that a lot of the current atrocities and sectarian violence are likely to continue.

If the West acts we will likely see repercussions in the price or supply of oil that could cripple Western economies/draw us into a war against the KSR and their allies.

&gt; [Assad is] trying to make himself the protector of Syria against extremists, when he himself has even been funding some of those extremists  even purposely ceding some territory to them in order to make them more of a problem so he can make the argument that he is somehow the protector against them, he told reporters on January 17.

&gt;Several sources have claimed that ISIL prisoners were strategically released from Syrian prisons at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011.[156] The Assad regime has bought oil directly from both ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front.[103] United States Secretary of State John Kerry has stated that the Assad regime has tactically avoided ISIL forces in order to weaken moderate opposition such as the Free Syrian Army,[157] as well as ""even purposely ceding some territory to them [ISIS] in order to make them more of a problem so he can make the argument that he is somehow the protector against them"".[158] An IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center database analysis confirmed that only a small percentage of Assad regime attacks were targeted at ISIL in 2014.[152] The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has stated that the Assad regime has operatives inside ISIS,[159] as has the leadership of Ahrar ash-Sham.[160] ISIS members captured by the FSA have claimed that they were directed to commit attacks by Assad regime operatives.[161]

&gt;Some portions of visa secret information, thousands of documents from the MOFA's automation system and secret emails will be published gradually so as to keep Saudi puppets always in fear of their identity disclosure.

1227,"a) American weapon transfers to rebels in Syria were extremely small, and, realistically, have contributed virtually nothing to ISIS. ISIS funds itself, captured (and outright purchased) plenty of weapons from the Iraqi army, and got weapon donations from large regional players. The region is currently flush with small arms.

This is a different situation; obviously, a lot of American weapon aid to the Iraqi army does wind up in ISIS's hands, including stuff that we really don't want there. But Iraq wanted the American army out, so there's not much America can do but bombing campaigns and risk-managed weapons transfers (for example, sending AT-4's instead of Javelins).

b) I think you misunderstand what fuels involvement in ISIS. Especially for local members, there are multiple reasons for joining with ISIS, from tribal conflicts, to sectarian conflicts, to religious motivations, to a sociopathic drive for meaning and glory. No matter how we look at it, however, bombing them, even with serious collateral, will not dramatically strengthen their recruitment drives because they *are not fighting America.* They are fighting a war of territorial expansion to establish a caliphate that controls the Levant - that's why they are called the Islamic State of *Iraq and the Levant* - or they are fighting to secure themselves from Shia oppression, or they are fighting to gain territory/hold territory against neighboring tribes, or they are fighting because they are psychos - I mean that literally, not just to denigrate them.

The ""bombing creates more rebels"" theory has a certain, if incomplete, appeal to describe Al-Qeada, particularly in Yemen (among other places), but not to the American-led bombing campaign against ISIS in Iraq. If there is US activity that breeds support for ISIS, it is, paradoxically, American support for the largely Shia Iraqi army, because they have committed some of the actual attacks on Sunnis that have made joining ISIS appealing.

Now, this article notes that the religious motivations of many ISIS members includes an opposition to modernity that is easily represented by America and other developed democratic societies, but bombing people does not make them religiously opposed to modernity; it may make them opposed to the American-led bombing campaign (including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc.), but, again, ISIS is not fighting America.

In the period following the Second World War, the US has engaged in covert operations and coup attempts in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries due to their support for Socialism and Russia (just as in South and Central America, Africa, and South East Asia):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Syria

This means that the primary choice of opposition was radical Sunni Islamists due to their rejection and violent opposition to the inherent secularism of socialist leaning governments:

http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-s-uprising-in.../29221

This has lead to decades of violence and conflict between the Syrian government and the Sunni radicals, and terrorist attacks against Syrian Christian and Alawites. The Sunnis due to their lack of political dominance in the country have instead resorted to terrorist attacks against civilians and government officials in order to oppose the secularism of the Syrian government, the government forced into a position to protect Syrian civilians has lead to increasing violence between the two factions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Syria

Syria's current uprising is not secular or based on the desire for democratic reform. The majority of the Syrian protesters and rebels have always been dominated by radical Sunnis who have wanted a government based on Sharia.

Syrias uprising is not a secular one. Most participants are devout Muslims inspired by Islam. By virtue of Syrias demography most of the opposition is Sunni Muslim and often come from conservative areas.

http://foreignpolicy.com/.../islamism-and-the-syrian.../

Iraqi politicians stated numerous times that if the US backed the Syrian rebels it would destabilize Iraq, which as they called, happen exactly as they said it would.

The idea that secularists and moderates ever had a chance to be the dominate rebel military opposition in Syria is a nonsensical fantasy. -Patrick Cockburn

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nODxF4jOjCs) 

Additionally, a western diplomat makes the startling revelation that the vast majority of Syrian rebels are Islamist thugs:

""The official was his governments main conduit to the Syrian rebels. I asked him what percentage of the rebels western countries could support: what percentage were not jihadis, not committing human rights abuses, looting or kidnapping  and were militarily effective?""

[""There was a silence. Finally, he said: Thirty per cent. It was a devastating admission. Then he paused and said he had been considering only the first three criteria. Adding in military effectiveness, you would have to say the West could support only 10 per cent.""](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041901/assad-now-has-the-enemy-he-wants/)

Hassan Aboud of Soquor al-Sham and Abu Ayman of Ahrar al-Sham, another Islamist group, said that whoever was vetting which groups receive the weapons was doing an inadequate job.

Your over simplified argument could be turned right back around on the united states for propaganda use in the opposite viewpoint. ""America is a huge threat.

They've killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, and are stealing our natural resources. They installing puppet dictators which cater to their economic and geo-political agendas.""

Its a legitimate statement, but provides no context and is oversimplified. And that's all we get from the mainstream media regarding the threat of ISIS. And yet, ISIS provides such utility for the United States. They were our gateway into Syria, they provided the UK and Canada the public fear they needed to pass far-reaching 'anti-terror' legislation, they allow our continued interventions in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. My basic question is, what does ISIS gain by making these threats against the west? They want to establish a caliphate state in the middle east, how does broadcasted beheadings of 2 Americans and the burning of a Jordanian, the claiming of attacks in the US (Texas art contest), and endless threats, even with nuclear weapons, against the west, help further that cause? These things only benefit the players who benefit from these endless wars in the middle east. I think our support of Saudi Arabia, our support of Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war, our 2003 invasion of Iraq, our overthrow of Gaddafi, all show without doubt that our intentions in the middle east are in no way to spread democracy and support peace.

And an additional point I want to make about the use of American propaganda. Think about the accusations we made against Saddam in terms of massacring his own people, suppressing uprisings, and his brutal dictatorship. Well... what are we doing right now? Saddam may have suppressed the Kurds and Shia's in northern Iraq, but now we (through the current Iraqi Ayatollah and other proxies) are massacring and suppressing the Sunni uprising which is ISIS, many of which are residents of Iraq (many are former dispersed Iraqi National Guard). So we run the same dictatorship that Saddam did, just in a different perspective. Not to mention, per Paul Bremer's orders of the new constitution of Iraq, the Ba'athist's are banned in the state, hows that for democracy? Conditions are no better in Iraq, and by most standards they're significantly worse. We've just reversed the roles. 

You might say, hey, ISIS is terrible, and does terrible things. That may be true, but what do you think the Sunni and Ba'athist setiment against the Shia's and Kurds were under Saddam?

&gt; a movement for the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel.

Then anti-Zionism is by definition the opposition to that movement. Since Israel currently exists, then what that means, is that anti-Zionists want to destroy that nation. A person who is an anti-Zionist cannot be loyal to the state of Israel. He can be loyal to a different state, like Palestine, but not to Israel, since he is opposed to it's very existence.

Sure, someone who isn't a Zionist is not necessarily disloyal to Israel, but someone who is anti-Zionist is, by the very definition of the word.

In your example of Egypt, would you say ISIS operatives in Egypt are loyal to Egypt? Obviously not. ISIS wants to destroy Egypt, and unite the middle east into a Muslim Caliphate.

Same thing with those who describe themselves as anti-Zionists, just on a smaller scale. They want to destroy Israel, and unite it with Palestine.

1307,"Yes, the basic talking points fed by the west. ISIS has losses of over 20,000 military. Iraqi security forces have losses of about 9,000.

Yes, terrible things are happening because of ISIS, terrible things have happened because of United States interventions.

My question is, how are we still continuing the spiral of more and more war and conflict, and who are the players in the background making enormous profits off of these conflicts. 

I would support what you're saying if western interventions to these conflicts were actual solutions, but they're not, and we just end up doing the same horrific things as our enemies, and creating many, many more of them. We destroy infrastructure, displace large groups of people, create even more poverty than before, then brand any uprisings on terrorism. We use these new enemies to build up popular support for more war, and the spiral of insanity continues, and its clearly working again, as many people believe ISIS is a new threat that must be dealt with by western intervention.

Again, my point is, that the West is not rattling off 24/7 about the threat of ISIS because they're a realistic threat to the United States or the UK, but because it is used as a pretext to continued intervention. How can we sanction Iran, fight ISIS, sanction Syria, work with Assad, fight Iran by proxy in Yemen while working with Iran to fight ISIS, fight Hezbollah by proxy while Hezbollah fights ISIS, support the Sunni's in Saudi Arabia while supporting the Shia's in the Iraqi Security forces, and then somehow sell that ISIS IS A THREAT TO THE WORLD.

...***What?***



Nowhere in that incoherent rambling does a single coherent point emerge.  Cherrypicking a few lines here and there, spouting nonsense clearly inspired by the propaganda you've heard, but not nearly intelligent enough to succeed as such, ignoring the actual reality of the situation that I had just explained...this is nonsense.  Here are the facts, once again.  Read over them carefully and see if you can understand.


The United States wants foreign governments that they can control to some degree, either by exerting direct control on the leadership or having similar goals on a geopolitical level.  This usually ends up as supporting dictatorships, since it's easier to control a single dictator than an entire voting populace.  


Most countries in the middle east are majority Muslim.  Therefore, a democratically elected government will generally be based on Muslim principles, just like the majority Christian USA has a government based heavily on Christianity.  


To exert control over Muslim majority countries, it is helpful to spread propaganda promoting hate and Islamophobia.  ""Terrorist"" and ""islamist"" are buzzwords frequently found in this propaganda that are essentially meaningless--the propagandists have succeeded in convincing people they are bad things, and thus when thrown at an 'enemy' gullible people such as yourself start to hate just like you're told to do.  


Further, the military-industrial complex that exerts tremendous power over the American government needs a constant state of war in order to survive, and thus a constant enemy.  Communism filled that role for a long time, but ever since the Soviet Union dissolved there has been a void.  A boogeyman is necessary, so the war on Islam began.  



The racism and Islamophobia of this campaign is due to several factors, many of which are part of the propaganda you receive.  First, there is the obvious fact that the United States consistently refuses to recognize a Muslim-led democracy, instead branding the winning parties terrorists, such as the Muslim Brotherhood.  The secular dictatorship of Sisi was considered better because it allowed western powers to continue to control Egypt and it was consistent with the war on Islam.  Calling a group ""terrorists"" because you disagree with them and they are Muslims is a common tactic, really.  Look at Hezbollah; the US calls them a terrorist organization despite the fact that they are basically the de facto Lebanese army and only defend the country against invasion, not only that but they are *right now* defending the Lebanese people against ISIS.  


But the western media doesn't acknowledge these groups for what they are.  They'd rather see ISIS proliferate so they can continue the campaign of hate against Muslims.  They want to convince you that ISIS is somehow representative of Islam despite the fact that these so-called ""islamists"" and ""terrorists"" are fighting against them.  



And some people are gullible enough, or just hateful enough, to think that a secular dictator like Sisi or Saddam Hussein or Assad is better than a Muslim-led democracy.  They cheer when Sisi's forces imprison and execute political opponents because the media says those people are *Muslims* and of course all Muslims are evil, right?



To summarize, they want you to fear Islam and believe it is somehow a cause of violence so that they can install secular dictators who they can then control.  The truth is Islam is no different from any other major religion in its support of or likelihood of inducing violence.  But Islam is most common in the middle east, and so is oil.  Outside powers want that oil, and they need to control the region to do so.  Attempts in the past resulted in decades of turmoil that continues today, attempts in the present revolve around racebaiting and propaganda.

The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire led to the rise in the ""Middle East"" of Western powers, such as Britain and France.

After WWII when france and england ceased to be world powers the US stepped in to keep the territories Communist free as it would have seriously boosted the USSR. Its not cut and dry as america is the cause.

* The amount is relatively low.

* They are not top-notch anti-tank weaponry. The AT-4 was invented in 1983 and fielded in 1987. It is not a serious threat to tanks, and will do exactly what the US proposes it will do: destroy suicide bomb cars and ISIS tacticals, which are, even if you just view combat footage, clearly both demoralizing and effective offensive ISIS tools that they use to overrun Iraqi positions. From the AT-4 wikipedia:

&gt; It is intended to give infantry units a means to destroy or disable armoured vehicles and fortifications, although it is not generally sufficient to defeat a modern main battle tank.

* The weapons are 1-use only, without the possibility to replace the ammunition. Again, from the wikipedia:

&gt; The launcher and projectile are manufactured prepacked and issued as a single unit of ammunition with the launcher discarded after a single use.

* ISIS is fantastic on offense, shittastic on defense. The reason is that the Iraqi army puts up a horrible defense, not that ISIS has strong operation-level skills. Certainly, 1980's infantry anti-tank weaponry will not make ISIS a much greater offensive threat (to add: ISIS already has anti-tank weaponry), and as for ISIS's defense, ISIS has lost virtually every major defensive engagement in the past year. On the other side, AT-4's will definitely help the Iraqi army fix up its defense. So, as weapons transfers go, this seems well thought out.

1352,"&gt; you've probably had lots of advantages that the bulk of daesh's members have not.

Meaning absolutely no disrespect, I cordially reject your idea that membership in Daesh/ISIS/ISIL --or whatever else you want to call it-- is driven solely or even predominantly by poverty and/or political and social disenfranchisement or lack of privilege.  

Were this the key element behind the formation of such an organization, we would expect to find equally vehement groups gaining strength and even taking power in the many regions of the world where people are even poorer and more disenfranchised than in the Middle-east.  Nor would we expect to see western converts since, after all, if members of ISIS were driven to join purely on the basis of being poor, westerners would not, as you rightly point out, fit the bill.

However, none of the above is actually the case.  In point of fact, ISIS attracts young men of all stripes, whether economically disenfranchised or not, and as such is the case, I think that any reasonable analysis has to conclude that once again, ideology is, if not the sole driver, at least a huge component behind what is going on with ISIS.

ISIS provides easy answers to everything in a strictly encoded and enforced set of social and religious laws that to the weak-minded must represent something very much like stability, certainty, in what otherwise may often appear to be a very chaotic world.  As a former employee of mine once said --a guy who'd done 12 years in prison for attempted murder-- ""some guys like being in prison. They don't have to worry about anything; everything is taken care of, it gives them a sense of security.""  

Ultimately then, I reject your idea that economic factors are the only or even primary driver behind membership in ISIS.  While economic reality may play a small role, the primary driver is to do with ideology and the notion of having all one's questions answered and taken care of by a simplistic doctrine that tells it's followers that they are on God's side.

&gt;A pissed off population managed to give the the largest, most technologically advanced, most practiced, most skilled military in the world some real heart ache;

The ""largest skilled military"" was not even using its full strength at all. Most of the attacks on US troops were hit-and-run style attacks and planted ieds by the Iranian/Syrian-backed insurgents and AQ terrorists. It wasn't even a ""war"" with ""battles"". It was just criminal activities in various cities. It wasn't like how ISIS is rolling up and taking over a city.

US had 3x as many troops in Vietnam and dropped 210 million more bombs on Vietnam than in Iraq.

The surge worked just fine, and that was barely 180,000 troops. In Vietnam we had 540,000 troops deployed.

And when I am talking about Vietnam, don't make the assumption that we didn't devastate the North Vietnamese army with 1950s-60s technology (or cite the idea that we ""lost""... If by ""lost"" you mean retreated, then sure but that's not relevant to how successful the US army was there. A propaganda victory for the North vietnamese is hardly a loss for US forces. The US lost politically not militarily). We have way better technology now. We demolished over 1 million enemy soldiers in Vietnam. We destroyed that country and few people actually realize just how devastating the US forces were.

So just remember that, while people talk about how ""we get bogged down in war"" or ""can't achieve victory in some of our wars."" They're talking about the reality of (a) when an enemy doesn't surrender and make peace. (b) when US Armed forces lose troops in a slow-style bleed. ... In other words, people's definition of ""loss"" for the US is different from the original definition of ""loss"". It's basically ""why didn't you have total control and complete peace and total surrender of the enemy?"" It's a higher standard for the US. 

A standard where body counts, enemy loss of territory, and enemy loss of property, aren't being factored in.

 Instead, for enemies of this superpower, the only thing that counts is ""willpower"", did the enemy surrender? So all the enemy has to do, is not surrender and keep fighting, and eventually the US decides to go away. The terrorists have figured this out already. They learned it from the North Vietnamese.

I actually don't know as much as I'd like about Daesh's demographics, other than that it's predominantly men from the Levant, supplemented with Caucus mercenaries and a small percentage of European/Americans. This is backed up by numbers given by the [CIA/UN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ISIL#Troops_in_Iraq_and_Syria); showing around 15k foreign members, most of which are from Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. I'm making a leap by assuming the people coming from poorer countries are, themselves, poor, but I think that's about as good as estimates get.

&gt;Were this the key element behind the formation of such an organization, we would expect to find equally vehement groups gaining strength and even taking power in the many regions of the world

But we do. Boko Haram has made the news lately as a Daesh-like force in Africa. Hamas (while older) engages in more traditional terrorism, but maintains a similar set of enemies as Daesh (even though they consider Daesh their enemy) and uses similarly callous tactics, the Uyghurs in northern China / India have been growing in strength, and there are dozens of smaller brigades that arise independently but have recently pledged themselves in service of Daesh.

The document proves that the intelligence community foresaw the rise of ISIS when they would follow there current strategy to isolate Assad by backing radical sunni forces which even was considered as an strategic asset, as it would help to drive back emerging shiite forces in the middle east.

So ISIS has been created with full support of western forces while their governments used the self created terrorist thread to justify the expansion of mass surveillance at home.

At the time happening, the goverments narrative was that only moderate rebel forces would be supported, what most likely was nothing more than an outright lie.",-2,0.0647575757576,0.124789545667,0.461636363636,0.210041568349,0.273571428571,0.465,151,0.0740740740741,37.75,0.175,0.275

So much so, that even when Saddam was caught and seen in the court shackled, the Iraqis began to sweat with fear even though he had 0% chance of freedom.   It is easy to see how ISIS came to be and how their terroristic actions against their own people (for decades) translates directly into what you see today.  Koran is more or less an excuse for some of their actions.

To expound upon this even more, his people were so suspicious of each other and their leaders that they were and are demoralized to the point that they just don't care.  That is why the US had so much trouble attempting to stabilize the country and its government.  The people were unable to reform without corruption and were separating and segregating even more than they were before and this led to extreme terrorist groups, half ass police and military which is impossible to correct without a willingness to unite.

Listen: I am not trying to say that there are not beautiful or morally relevant sections of the Qu'ran.  There are passages that are wonderful, poetic, and true in a sense widely recognized by almost every ideology on the planet.  But there are also sections that imply that the correct way to deal with apostates is to *kill them*.  There are sections that explicitly state that women are worth *much less* than men, and that their proper place is in a subservient and obedient role.  I'm not saying we should throw the baby out with the bathwater, I'm saying that the bathwater is gross.  Christianity, being rooted in many of the same traditions as Islam, has gross bathwater too.  The babies are great in both.  And I'd even argue that the majority of these texts consist of the ""baby"", and are not problematic with modern ethics.  

But to suggest that the influence that these holy texts have over their respective religions is inconsequential is, frankly, ridiculous.  We are talking about the most influential books *on the planet*.  I'm not talking solely of religious texts, I'm talking about books period.  Name a tome that has carried more cultural weight and influenced more of human society than the Bible or the Qu'ran or the Vedic texts like the Bhagavad Gita.  

Again, to clarify (although I think I've been pretty clear) I am not condemning Muslim people simply because they are Muslim.  I know, love and respect many people of the Muslim faith.  The same could be said about Christians, or Hindus, Buddhists, you name it.  My problem is with the texts that inform these people's ideology.  And the thing is, most religious people pick and choose sections of texts they tote as ""infallible"" and ""unilaterally true"".  In that way they can be simultaneously moral and religious.  Do Christians beat their slaves as the Bible compels them to?  Some might, but only the wackos that the religion as a whole denounces today.  The vast majority do not adhere to this practice because modern society has evolved past this, and Christianity has had to reconcile.

1524,"&gt;Please quote where I said that slavery is okay ? 

It is true that apologizing for slavery in an Islamic context doesn't mean you are for slavery yourself. I apologize for that, but I won't apologize for considering your words slavery apologism. If you're against slavery, I suggest you refrain from slavery promotion and condemn it unconditionally.

&gt;If Muslims followed Islam there would be no slavery because of all the rules and incentive to free slaves. 

There are examples of Mohammed being against freeing slaves, for enslaving, for trading slaves, being for the rape of slaves (according to my own morality, which I won't apologize for via some misplaced notion of moral relativism). According to these examples, ISIS would have cause to disagree with you and instead keep on enslaving and raping.

&gt;look at the social status of the Mamluks as an example.

Look at the social status of castrated African slaves as an example; the men, women and children having their life destroyed, torn apart and forced into lifelong slavery, all because Mohammad couldn't say these three words: ""Slavery is wrong"". Historical acts of Muslim slavers shouldn't be cause for Islamic apologism... no more than the Ottoman practice of impalement, for example. ISIS isn't arguing for Islam on the basis of something like Mamluk slaves or the Ottoman empire, but on the basis of the original Islam as they read it.

&gt;I referenced scriptures and backed my statement with historical and factual data, what do you want ?

I want you to explain why you're apologizing for slavery. Is it because Islam is so stigmatized in the worldthe religion of the around 2 billion Muslims and risingthat you need to give them a hand? I want you to explain things like Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 459; Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 41, Number 598; Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3432; Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 47, Number 765... and what its implications are via the Sunnah. Why ISIS is any less justified in their acts and religious rationale than some moderate Muslim with their own version, especially according to the referenced sacred texts.

&gt;Just because it's against your agenda it is ""very convenient""?

My anti-slavery agenda? Undoubtedly so. It's very convenient to defend Islam by defending the type of slavery it promotes. It's wrong to anybody but the fundamentalist Muslims, but if you want to defend slavery, go ahead. 

&gt;You cannot justify the actions of DAESH with the scriptures, it's as simple as that.

I'm waiting for DAESH to torture people to death, just like Mohammed (Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 261...). They are already killing people whom they deem apostates, or who actually are apostates (Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 260), just like Mohammed commands.

However, the call of ISIS is different than the call of Muhammad, peace be upon him. Muhammad, peace be upon him, called to singling out Allah in worship, and due to oppression and breaking of peace treaties, they went to war with the pagans. 

ISIS, on the other hand, is coming out of nowhere, calling to establishing the khaleefah at all costs. This is not the call of the prophets. ISIS is calling to the khaleefah and only mention monotheism when it is politically convenient for them and as a smoke screen to hide their true intentions.

That's okay friend, I just wish to have a constructive discussion. I don't consider myself an apologist, I'm merely fighting misconceptions of what is slavery in Islam (most people think of the transatlantic slave trade). 

&gt;There are examples of Mohammed being against freeing slaves, for enslaving, for trading slaves, being for the rape of slaves (according to my own morality, which I won't apologize for via some misplaced notion of moral relativism). According to these examples, ISIS would have cause to disagree with you and instead keep on enslaving and raping.

Can you give me examples, be sure to research your subject before posting discrepancies or disputed historical allegations. I find it surprising considering that the teachings of Islam regarding slaves are quite the opposite, why didn't Islam follow the bible or the torah ?

&gt;Look at the social status of castrated African slaves as an example; the men, women and children having their life destroyed, torn apart and forced into lifelong slavery, all because Mohammad couldn't say these three words: ""Slavery is wrong"". Historical acts of Muslim slavers shouldn't be cause for Islamic apologism... no more than the Ottoman practice of impalement, for example. ISIS isn't arguing for Islam on the basis of something like Mamluk slaves or the Ottoman empire, but on the basis of the original Islam as they read it.

But Muhammad clearly said that tormenting slaves is forbidden, you shouldn't blame theology because some Muslims didn't follow his teachings. Judging the stupid actions of some Muslims is fine, but my point is that they cannot be justified by the scriptures. 

&gt;I want you to explain why you're apologizing for slavery. Is it because Islam is so stigmatized in the worldthe religion of the around 2 billion Muslims and risingthat you need to give them a hand? I want you to explain things like Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 459; Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 41, Number 598; Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3432; Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 47, Number 765... and what its implications are via the Sunnah. Why ISIS is any less justified in their acts and religious rationale than some moderate Muslim with their own version, especially according to the referenced sacred texts.

First of all you have to read the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim, today hadiths are more important than the Qu'ran in the Islamic corpus (hadiths and notes from scholars are used for tafsir and interpretations of the Qu'ran) but many of them are false and contradicts the Qu'ran itself. DAESH strong point isn't theology, they get destroyed by scholars on a daily basis, I don't care about their interpretation of x hadiths if it's contradicting the Qu'ran, the Qu'ran is pretty clear when people need to be punished : 

&gt;The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes, and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of Allah , if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.

Don't you see the problem ? The Qu'ran doesn't need interpretations, interpretations happened after when the Islamic corpus was formed and for political reasons, why should we allow interpretations ? The answer is ""because some scholars centuries after the death of the Prophet said so based on reports who contradicts the Qu'ran and some of them have poor chain transmission or contradicts other hadiths in the same collection"", is this logical to you ?

&gt;My anti-slavery agenda? Undoubtedly so. It's very convenient to defend Islam by defending the type of slavery it promotes. It's wrong to anybody but the fundamentalist Muslims, but if you want to defend slavery, go ahead. 

As I said, stop with the petty comment and insults. The ""fundamentalism"" you're talking about is not fundamentalism it's simply cherry picking, today jihadists rely on scholars and reports, fundamentalism in Islam is the Qu'ran.

&gt;I'm waiting for DAESH to torture people to death, just like Mohammed (Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 261...). They are already killing people whom they deem apostates, or who actually are apostates (Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 260), just like Mohammed commands.

Thanks for proving my point by using hadiths who contradicts the Qu'ran, you should really read about the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim there is a great book in Arabic by Gamal al-Banna and in english you have ""Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy"".",1,0.0831140350877,0.175484780881,0.476026872737,0.279869546738,1.0,0.9,832,0.0648535564854,25.2121212121,0.256944444444,0.701388888889

1565,"&gt;(most people think of the transatlantic slave trade)

Christian slavery apologists sound just like Islamic slavery apologists. One might as well say that most people think of the Muslim-operated trans-Saharan slave trade when they hear Islamic slavery, if most knew it had existed. Slavery is slavery to me. Mohammad failed in ending or simply condemning it in principle, and the results have echoed through the centuries, in the despair of slaves specifically. Today it's Yezidis, hundreds of years ago it was Africans, Europeans, Caucasians etc. Rationalize or fantasize about the great Mamluks all you want, I wouldn't dare to fantasize anything positive about an abhorrently immoral practice such as slavery. I don't care what most people think, I care about what slavery is, and slavery is slavery. Apologia of slavery is what it is, Islamic, Christian or secular. Today nobody apologizes for people who watched heretics burn in Europe hundreds of years ago, nor do they apologize for the ""kind"" Western slave owners... but Islamic slavery apologetics abound, apparently. All because the Quran encourages slavery, and because of the bizarre moral relativism Muslim religionists hypocritically employ when they, conveniently, aren't arguing for the divine objective morality that's supposedly in the Quran.

&gt;Can you give me examples, be sure to research your subject before posting discrepancies or disputed historical allegations.

The historical allegations belong to the Hadith, which I did not compose nor do I condone as having any historical or ""divine"" value. What history Islam, and Mohammed especially, has without the Hadith, I do not know. If the Hadith needs to be interpreted in some contrived way, in my eyes that only serves to condemn Islam even more, for such a religion is obviously full of ways to exploit humanity. Other than pointing out slavery as being explicitly condoned in the Quran, even without the Hadith, of course all the minutia of slavery practices is up for grabs by the Islamic sects. Criticize me for not aiming to become an Islamic scholar here and now, but do you have any criticism of the specific Hadith I posted, which ISIS follows in their quest to be the most Islamic? ISIS is who you have to fight, via authoritative interpretations or otherwise, not me. Islam ""in general"" has already lost me.

&gt;But Muhammad clearly said that tormenting slaves is forbidden, you shouldn't blame theology because some Muslims didn't follow his teachings. 

Mohammad clearly says many things, depending on what you consider authoritative. Point out which Hadith are unacceptable to you, otherwise Mohammad can be shown as being very much for mistreating all humans, within the conditions of his version of divine morality, of course. Aside from the pathologically pacifist religious figures in some other religions, religions tend to take the right to impose harm on humanity in the name of divine guidance. I don't believe you that Mohammad is against mistreating anybody, as long as it served his purposes as prophet of God while still alive.

&gt;Don't you see the problem ? The Qu'ran doesn't need interpretations, interpretations happened after when the Islamic corpus was formed and for political reasons, why should we allow interpretations ?

Tell that to Muslims, and believers of other religions with respect to their own sacred texts. I'm not here to defend ISIS's interpretation of Islam, we don't need that, I'm here to condemn religious dogma as a guide to behaviour. 

&gt;...contradicts the Qu'ran and some of them have poor chain transmission or contradicts other hadiths in the same collection"", is this logical to you ?

The Quran itself isn't logical to me, much less the people who've circled and interpreted it with whichever extra text for the last 1400 years. I've even heard condemning criticism of all the Hadith, not just ""some"". I trust myself to be objective enough to go against any ancient Islamic scholar, whom you think had the right idea about Islam, and show him to be immoral according to what most of us, at least in the West today, consider morality.

&gt;As I said, stop with the petty comment and insults. The ""fundamentalism"" you're talking about is not fundamentalism it's simply cherry picking, today jihadists rely on scholars and reports, fundamentalism in Islam is the Qu'ran.

You take the right to be insulted by what I said; feel free, I think it's a good thing. I want the right to be insulted as well, since the only way to correct certainty in falsehood is through a process which tends to feel insulting or degrading. And I do indeed take insult at your slavery apologism, and I take insult to Islam and the Quran. It's a horrible religion. I am certain enough that slavery, no matter how ""Islamically proper"" via the ""holy Quran"", is immoral; with the Hadith or no. Criticize people for cherry picking, I've no reason to believe you're not doing the same with your own interpretation of Islam.

&gt;you should really read about the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim there is a great book in Arabic by Gamal al-Banna and in english you have ""Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy"".

I may look it up. Nonetheless, I will also reiterate my point: I'm not in danger of raping people because Mohammad didn't say slavery is wrong. Some, some Muslims seem to be. That is not my fault. It's not my burden. Even if it was, a kafir such as myself wouldn't be accepted by the 2 billion Muslims as an authority on proper Hadith interpretation. Nothing about what Gamal al-Banna says will fix my view of Mohammed or Islam. Not because I'm not willing to learn, it's because the Quran condemns itself enough, and surely some authentic Hadith (according to you and Gamal, if you two are the authoritative standard) will suffer the same condemnation. Muslims say ""To you your religion and to me mine."", my religion is to despise religions like Islam, and individuals like Mohammad.",3,0.0986906005872,0.235469343169,0.456840656151,0.296513913038,1.5,1.0,1026,0.0683760683761,20.52,0.275,0.60625

The Sunnis and Shias more than likely would fail to come to terms.  ISIS happened because the Syrian war gave them the power in east Syria and Iraqi division allowed them to pull from the Sunni anger.

Even if we beat ISIS it'll only be a matter of time before another offshoot pops up.  I simply don't see a democracy in Iraq satisfying both the groups.  One of them's going to get shafted and then Saudi Arabia and Iran will capitalize to fight the other through Iraqi proxy.  Even right now people are cheering that Iran's backing up militants against ISIS, but that's just going to end up cementing Sunni anger against Iraqi government since they'll be pulling from Shia militias and Iran.

USA won't commit to empowering Assad and the rebels are a hotbed for terrorist groups.  Not to mention there'd be very troubling issues if Iraqi government decides they won't welcome Western forces like they refused to do in 2011.  You might remember Obama removing all combat troops, that was because Iraq refused to give them immunity.  If they stayed you'd essentially make it clear to the Iraqi people that unless your government is accepted by the Western standards, we'll simply walk over your sovereignty.  Because if troops started getting arrested or not welcomed in Iraq, would we simply remove their government's power?

Fact of the matter is Syria and Iraq are extremely connected.  Democracy simply won't work because it ends up with extremists gaining more power or people getting mad due to getting shafted.  Obama doesn't want to send ground troops because that means even after we beat ISIS, we have to play nation-builder and figure out a way to build a government that both Syrians and American leaders approve of, which simply won't happen because America is hardlined against what the Syrians would want.

1575,"You're right, I didn't. I felt it would have been long winded but here it is imo: the world as it's power structures are organized now (UN, NATO etc.) are extremely unipolar, and America is that pole. After WW2 America basically forged a New World Order (no not the lizard people one ;)) in which the idea of sovereign right (meaning war for territory is a huge no-no) were held above all else, this was a reaction to the Soviet annexation of Eastern Europe. This world order was only half of the puzzle until the Soviet collapse however, and right as they fell Saddam tried to invade and annex Kuwait. What Saddam was doing more than just ""getting his"" was provoking the US and their World Model, because he was demonstrating that even without the Soviets that the US would not respond to an attack on a sovereign nation for their territory. The US did not want there to be another alternative World Model in which rogue nations could ignore UN resolutions or pressure from the West, so they invaded but didn't take him out, respecting his sovereign rights but trying to force him to conform to their World Model.

After 9/11, the game changed and shortly after Saddam kicked out UN weapons inspectors, proving once again he was a geopolitical black hole and did not answer to the global community, effectively spitting in the face of the power structures the US has been trying to put in place since WW2 and especially post-Soviets. We laugh at it now, but Saddam having WMDs and being internationally unaccountable, and looking to nurture an ""axis"" World Model where rogue nations can do as they please with their neighbors (and potentially fund terrorism which would erode our power by proxy attrition) was a very real existential threat to the world order built by NATO and the US. He had the ingredients to do it, and there is a chance he sent his weapons to Bashar al-Assad because he is a Russian vassal and the Russians still have an interest in an opposing World Model. They would have a lot to gain from making America's excursions in the name of their world order look foolish. Who knows if it happened like that but we do know from Russia's annexation of Crimea that they are politically in favor of a different world order, where there are no sovereign rights.

On ISIS and Assad, I believe Obama is playing a dangerous game trying to wield chaos to achieve geopolitical goals. ISIS is not a sustainable organization, their wrath breeds contempt in  the people around and under them. They will crumble. Assad is far more stable in peace time, and if his regime survives he will continue to generate legitimacy for the Russian World Model, which undercuts American power, so in American interest the Obama administration is trying to turn ISIS back into Syria to take down Assad, because ISIS is making us friends out of foes (Iran is closer now imo than anytime since 1979) and Assad makes foes out of friends due to Syrian regional political and economic power, and also gives the Russians power in the Middle East. We can't take out Assad directly either unless he scorns the international community like Saddam because that looks bad when we try to make sovereign rights a staple of our world order. 

tl;dr In the middle east, Saddam and Assad (and Iran as well) give power to an alternate world order which is crafted by Russia and is effectively the shadow of Soviet world order.

It works great for Israel, America, Russia (as long as it can keep selling T-72s, and keep Bashar propped up). Meanwhile the civilians and soldiers are being massacred.

But hey, Salman said hes going to deal with it.

""Bush also vowed to destroy al-Qaeda but then he falsely accused Saddam of supporting al-Qaeda and invaded Iraq.""

---The decision to remove Saddam occurred years before Bush was even president. In 1998 President Clinton signed into [law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act) to remove him with 100% Senate support. In fact President Bush publicly stated there was no connection between Saddam and 9/11 even during the thickest fighting during 2006-07.

You'll find Al Qaeda was ,in fact, created by Bin Laden in response to Christians being in Saudi Arabia. Both of the founders of these groups were religious zealots not some conspiracy.

1618,"&gt;can't be compared to the transatlantic slave trade ? Do you deny the rights they had ? 

I deny the necessity to discuss rights of slaves in the context of religion. Historians have their objectivity, Islamic apologists do not. I deny the rights slaves had ""in Islam"" because I deny the use of relativism outside of objective, historical academic study and I consider the idea of human rights under slave ownership as self-contradictory; I don't care about any other than the most basic human rights. Religions aren't history fan clubs, they are ideologies. Religious sects can of course be sympathetic to 21. century morals and we know that the opposite is true as well, not even including things like ISIS. What one apologizes for through a religion, no matter how historical it is, has consequences in the present. Just because moderate believers find ways to rationalize, or remain in cognitive dissonance about their beliefs, doesn't mean the potential for abuse is not ever-present. And, again, that potential is not there because people are doing mere history, it's because they're describing a religion, its nature and commandments; in the case of Islam we have the prophet of God who could do apparently anything he wanted, but did not end slavery or explicitly condemn it. Only 21. century, professional rationalizers of nonsense could find a way to make this sound reasonable or as anything other than what it was, and only people with a pro-Islamic bias, whether Muslims or Islamophiles, self-appointed ""Muslim-defenders"", would go as far as to muse about ""slavery rights"" in Islam... especially when Islam's doctrinal disregard for basic human rights (or due to its inherent ambiguity, if that's your defense) bore fruit in something as horrible as ISIS.

I repeat, ""Slavery is always wrong... don't ever enslave..."" is all that had to be said by Mohammed in the book and ISIS would have nothing to stand on. Some want us to believe that ""people would be doing this regardless of Islam"" and others should remind them of the changes people and societies go through with the evolution of their beliefs and moral standards. We stopped burning people in the town square, coincidentally when the beliefs and morals changed. Muslim apologists' tendency to discuss the details of how slavery is excellent and good and morally superior because it was from God's prophet (and totally unlike Western slavery), leads to what this whole post is aboutYezidis being enslaved.

Christians have the same problem with rogue African preachers who're spreading homophobia and ""kill the gays"" laws, that didn't exist in Africa before the arrival of Islam and Christianity by the way. The movements didn't exist before American Christian anti-gay experts left to places more tolerant of their anti-gay ambitions. It would all be unnecessary if homosexuality was simply accepted by the religions, but people would rather discuss details of why homosexuality is theologically wrong and why homophobic sentiment is a good thing. Beliefs have consequences.

&gt;It's very naive of you to think that DAESH care about theology but it's not really wrong.

It's a fact that they follow theology. It's not just their own, it's beyond just ISIS. They didn't start it, they emerged from it. Fanatics that follow these movements don't steal Islam, they emerge from it through some interpretation. You have bystander supporters of ISIS who describe their crimes, almost unanimously condemned as un-Islamic, as mistakes or results of ambiguity in interpretation, and not a reason to suddenly disregard the great re-emergent Caliphate as a whole. So even being against ISIS isn't enough to stifle their enthusiasm for the experiment in progress, while innocents suffer horrifically. Being objective enough to see that religion can be anything from the most benign of interpretations to something like ISIS, and everything in between, is not naivety. ISIS aren't all psychopaths, they are mostly people going with the flow, and it doesn't help that Islam defines their life in societal and moral terms, instead of something like human rights.

&gt;Yes but as I said you really need to read the canonizing of Bukhari and Muslim, many people today follow scholars and hadiths over the teachings of the Qu'ran.

And they have that prerogative. And if they ruled the world, that Islam would be the ""true Islam"" by popular vote, just as it was for the Christianity of the Middle Ages; no matter how condemned it is today, it was the ""true Christianity"". It's not our job as humans to point out ""the true"" incarnations of anything and everything in the universe. When an ISIS emerges, when the ""many people who follow Hadith"" emerge, that's a fact of reality. That's the type of Islam that exists today. Don't like it? Write a book, start a Youtube channel, preach Quranism, restart the Mu'tazila sect, whatever... don't tell me who is or isn't doing Islam correctly. It's all folly to me and I don't accept your Quran-centrist view as anything other than another type of cherry picked Islam. 

&gt;Do you think the average person in this thread really care about that ? Do you think it's productive to alienate Muslims ?

I think the most alienating thing to do to humans is to dehumanize them. I don't express my insulting views of Islam, or my insulting attitude towards you as an ""apologist for this or that"", because I'm waging a war. It's because you are just a human to me, as worthy of regard as any other, and because Islam is just another ideology, as influential as any other. You have personal reasons to defend Islam in the standard way that you are, I have personal reasons to tell you why you're wrong. I don't think me telling Muslims what I think of their religion will de-alienate them or make us all friends, but I do believe in them enough as moral human beings that they won't join ISIS just because I'm implying ISIS has validity. The best and the worst things that can happen is that I'll be called an Islamophobe, while I point out my views on why these religious views are outdated and dangerous. Good for those Muslims that live a good life for themselves or others, but ISIS is just a cancer that grows out of a sick organism. ISIS may be throwing gays off of rooftops, but the Muslim world isn't moving towards gay acceptance either. I see a connection. ISIS is just an unfortunate, extreme, but eye-opening aspect of the potential within Islam. You don't get this sort of stuff because your religion is too good to not be the ""true will of God"", you get this because the religion isn't all that it's cracked up to be.

&gt;I guess you also think that taking prisoners is bad ?

By conquerors like Muslims in the name of Islam, so I can pay Jizya and be subjugated, if I'm lucky? Yes.

&gt;If you're a man of logic and reason you'll see that Islam was hijacked, just look at the comments here or websites using logical fallacies to criticize Islam, isn't that strange ?

For something to be hijacked it has to be something specific in the first place. Whatever Islam was, whatever Mohammad was, we don't know about it outside of Islamic sources, which you claim need correct interpretation themselves. There's not much external evidence of what early Islam was. All I know is that you have an Islam you believe is true and that I can't say anything that would convince you that you're wrong.

How about the twitter page officially run by the ISIS ""government."" Or the official videos made by ISIS. Or the widespread genocide (especially of the Yazidi peoples) and rapings that we *know* are happening. And the fact that the government does exactly fuck all to stem or even protest any of this.

And bloody hell, ISIS has not been shy in stating that its official policy is to not just to kill non-Muslims, but also muslims from different sects than them. Or banning basic educational foundations like mathematics, science, and history from anything outside of the Qu'ran.

&gt; you can take accounts of well documented abuse by us soldiers as a relative handful of tragedies? 

Yes, because there are. In any given conflict there are a relative handful of these cases. That is to say, that there *are* cases where US soldiers rape civilians, ormurder civilians under unjustifiable conditions. But these are relatively isolated cases, and not something that happens whenever the US enters a new city in a country.

And even then, these cases are not only rare, but very small in scope. It's not American troops killing dozens and hundreds of innocent Yazidis for no reason. It's one shitty guy raping a girl, or one or two shitty guys killing a couple of people. It's not an American platoon slaughtering entire masses of innocent people for no justifiable reason. And unlike in the IS, most cases where this has happened, especially in the last 100 years or so, end with trials and massive flak and punishment for the perpetrators, whereas in the IS the ""government"" either encourages or says absolutely nothing about it.

Show me the IS prosecuting someone for killing a Yazidi or what they consider a heretic/infidel, and I'll drop my argument. I'll be waiting.

&gt;but one or four occurrences by ISIS is enough for you to approve a large regional war sure to kill millions?

One or four? What the bloody hell are you talking about? There have been dozens of cases of ISIS killing and beheading journalists. And dozens of cases of mass beheadings. And numerous cases of mass murders of Yazidis. And numerous cases of women being captured and sold as sex slaves. And this is over a period of time of less than a year.

&gt;oh and murder is murder, the method is trivial

Sorry, but no. The world isn't so black and white that all bad things are equally bad. Bad isn't a monolith, not all bad things are the same kind of bad, and there is a sliding scale. In other words, we live in a world made up of different shades of grey.

For example, murdering someone because you were defending yourself is not equivalent to murdering someone out of cold blood. Furthermore, murdering someone by accident is not the same as premeditated murder - which is why pretty much any halfway decent legal system on the planet takes these things into consideration. Because not all similar bad actions are similarly bad.

Killing someone as an unintended consequence of attacking a military target is *not* the same as killing someone just to kill them. It's terrible and a tragedy, yes, but it is not comparable in the slightest.

&gt;america does the same barbaric things they do, proven in every war america has

Again, mind citing evidence for your baseless claim that the US has involved itself in behaviors that include genocide, taking losers as slaves, *sex slavery*, killing nonbelievers, and widespread cruel and unusual inhumane execution methods (by the standards of the time)?

Hardly.  If he was so well behaved, the US wouldn't have passed the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998 on the grounds that ""he committed various and significant violations of international law, had failed to comply with the obligations to which it [Iraq] had agreed following the Gulf War and further had ignored resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.  The Iraq Liberation Act passed 360-38 in the House, unanimously in the Senate, and was signed by President Clinton at that time.  In 1998, Clinton stated:

&gt; Iraq admitted, among other things, an offensive biological warfare capability, notably, 5,000 gallons of botulinum, which causes botulism; 2,000 gallons of anthrax; 25 biological-filled Scud warheads; and 157 aerial bombs. And I might say UNSCOM inspectors believe that Iraq has actually greatly understated its production....

&gt; Over the past few months, as [the weapons inspectors] have come closer and closer to rooting out Iraq's remaining nuclear capacity, Saddam has undertaken yet another gambit to thwart their ambitions by imposing debilitating conditions on the inspectors and declaring key sites which have still not been inspected off limits....

&gt; It is obvious that there is an attempt here, based on the whole history of this operation since 1991, to protect whatever remains of his capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction, the missiles to deliver them, and the feed stocks necessary to produce them. The UNSCOM inspectors believe that Iraq still has stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions, a small force of Scud-type missiles, and the capacity to restart quickly its production program and build many, many more weapons....

&gt; Now, let's imagine the future. What if he fails to comply and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route, which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the solemn commitments that he made? Well, he will conclude that the international community has lost its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you he'll use the arsenal....

That makes it very clear that Saddam wasn't concerned with the repercussions at all.

Syria was smashed due to a civil war.  

Iraq is a smoldering wreck thanks to a decade of war.

The Saudis are a bunch of pompous eunuchs.  They usually get other people to fight their wars (USA vs Iraq x 2) 

Turkey ... I have no idea, but they seem to see that there are problems - and they're training the Kurdish Pashmergas instead now of fighting with them.

Jordan - has a double humanitarian crisis of Palestinian refugees and Syrian refugees ; their already fragile economy is near its breaking point.  They have retaliated, but they're a very small nation.   Holding the line on their border seems to be the priority.

Lebanon - is another smoldering wreck. 

Egypt just came out of a civil war, and is a mess.

Yemen is a mess thanks to rebels.

The gulf states?  Maybe they can drive their Mercedes around ISIS and shock-and-awe them with their wealth.  /shrug - just like the Saudis./

The whole region is a huge mess thanks to lies told by / told to / believed by ... wait for it:  George W Bush's administration.

Now that the shattered nations of the Middle East need to act up, there are only a couple who have the power to fight ... sadly, their power to fight is really not up to par with the foe that they face.

This is a sad mess that is directly spawned out of the fraudulent wars that were started by the Bush Administration.

Im not saying either choice of action is incorrect. It doesn't matter if we *actively* fight ISIS with soldiers in the region, or if we *passively* fight ISIS with Airstrikes and targeted assassinations/capture like we've been doing.

What matters is the execution. Either tactic can work with the right plan in action.

In fact the government recently arrested soldiers who apprehended a convoy of weapons heading to Jihadists in Syria... That should show who they are supporting. I've read a story about a nurse in a Turkish border town who objected to having to treated wounded ISIS members everyday.

Even this Jihadist said they have members to transport this girl and safehouses in Turkey. I don't think they've done a single attack against that country even though its government is probably more secular than Assad's.

But yeah, I read an article and some oil smugglers were saying that at night in certain spots convoys of trucks line up with barrels of oil and they roll them across the border to awaiting trucks. They resell the oil in Turkey and make a good profit. So they make a lot of money that way.

ISIS also stole $500 million cash in Iraqi Dinars when they took Mosul. They have supporters who give them money. They have captured a lot of their weapons and ammo from the Iraqi army. At one point they had a convoy of American humvees and artillery. The Iraqi army is too incompetent to destroy this stuff. They also outnumbered ISIS greatly in Ramadi but somehow lost without putting up a fight. They're a joke basically. They've barely taken back any territory yet. I think the Kurds have taken more back.

In terms of banking support, I'd be surprised if any bank supported them. I'm not sure what they would get out of that investment. They do get donations from rich oil sheikh types in Gulf States though. Not directly from any governments (though that could be a possibility), but instead from shady/creepy fundamentalists. I think aid still comes into Raqqa and other towns because the outside world doesn't want them to starve, so when it comes to food they could just steal some of that.

So yeah:

Weapons: they've captured A LOT. A lot of ammo too. They use a lot of VBIEDS which only require explosives and cars. They also manufacture mortar rounds and other explosives with lathes and some basic skills. They definitely have manpads and ATGMs also.

Food: they can skim from donations and also force local farmers to 'donate' food to them. They mostly hold desert territory but along some of the rivers they control I'm sure there's a bit of food production.

cash: They captured $500 million from one bank alone. They sell oil. They ransom people they've kidnapped including Yazidis they've enslaved. They charge a tax on everyone in their territory, and charge Christians extra. I don't think many Christians have stayed but I'm sure some have and pay the tax.

What makes your sense of justice objectively better than the sense of justice of other people?

&gt;We have capital punishment. Why? Because it is justice to remove those who have committed the worst of crimes. 

We (the EU) don't. Why? Because the right to live is a human right, and regardless of your actions, you still remain a human being, and as such, it is not justice to murder you because of your actions.

&gt;Yes, you have human rights, right up to the point where you violate the human rights of others. At that point, you no longer have those rights, whereas your status is refined as a criminal.

So they are not human rights in your world view. They are privileges. 

Someone being a criminal does not change the fact that they are still human beings. They do not cease to be human beings when they are found guilty.

&gt;Criminal is a reduced state of existence.

No it is not. Criminal is someone who has been found guilty of a crime in a court. Criminals are still human. No law can reduce their humanity, as the law does not change their humanity.

Also, ISIS could say this:

&gt;Being infidel is a reduced state of existence. And that is why it is perfectly righteous to rid the earth of those who are infidel. They are infidels committing acts that are at this point against the will of God.

Now, does that seem right? If you have the right to decide that some statement by a cultural institution you believe in (court of law) reduces a state of existence, surely ISIS has the right to the same?

---Al Qaeda is not ""blowback"" from Operation Cyclone and this argument is ""accepted"" only by the liberal narrative which absolutely dominates this discussion. Outside of the liberal bubble ,that insists you put on historical blinders, you'll find these glaring facts: Al Qaeda didn't exist during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda was created by OBL in response to Islams teachings that Christians being in Saudi Arabia was a sin. The Islamic jurisprudence that dictates that all muslims must fight any non-believers in muslim lands is the catalyst for these groups opposing the Soviets when they invaded Afghanistan and when they opposed westerners who were defending Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It didn't matter to Al Qaeda whether the non-believers were attacking or defending muslims lands- what mattered to them was they were simply there. To suggest the U.S. created these groups because they were simply there or because the U.S. joined them in their fight against the Soviets is absurd. 

""As for ISIS, America's responsibility lies in destabilizing the region (Bush's adventurisms) and more recently covert arming of Syrian rebels through CIA Lybia-Syria ""rat line"""" 

---Once again the liberal narrative ,that Bush created ISIS, absolutely insists on historical blinders that dictate history began in 2003. The simple fact that melts this narrative is that [ISIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) was founded in 1999 by Jordanian radical Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as Jamat al-Tawd wa-al-Jihd, ""The Organisation of Monotheism and Jihad"" (JTJ) *before* Bush was even president. Once again an Islamic group was not motivated by oil or U.S. money or some covert operation but by Islamic jurisprudence. These groups entered Iraq *after they were created* to fight non-believers. The U.S. defeated these groups and when the U.S. left Iraq in 2011 ISIS had zero power. It was only after the U.S. left Iraq that Maliki proceeded to purge the Iraqi government and military of Sunni groups. The Syrian civil war was then the context in which ISIS grew as a military power. Those are the facts.

""And lastly the whole shebang of (modern) Islamic Terrorism had its roots in Petro-Islam""  

--This is absolutely false and easily proven by historical facts. Islamic militancy against the U.S. existed before oil. In fact our first war overseas was against Muslims who were murdering and enslaving Americans because of their religion. 

""In March 1785, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams went to London to negotiate with Tripoli's envoy, Ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja). When they enquired ""concerning the ground of the pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury"", the ambassador replied:

It was written in their Koran, that all nations which had not acknowledged the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave; and that every mussulman who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise."" 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War

--- What Sidi Haji Abdrahaman told Thomas Jefferson and John Adams in 1785 is *exactly the same doctrine* that ISIS uses in 2015 to justify their slaughter of non-believers. Oil did not create these groups. Bush did not create these groups. They would still exist if the U.S. didn't exist. They would still exist if Bush was never born. They would still exist if oil had never been discovered. The U.S. did not create these groups

A better explanation of the U.S.' motives in Iraq is to not allow US support to become the crutch that it was for a decade, the removal of which would leave the Iraqi security forces as crippled as it was at the end of OIF.  Iraqi success in tikrit, Mosul, and now ramadi will depend on the strength of the Iraqi security forces with limited support from the air.

I have no idea if they sneak in alcohol, there are plenty of ways in which ISIS are clearly motivated by religious considerations.

&gt;Not all ideologies are created equal, and some ideologies can have intrinsically bad or dangerous parts, which must be open to criticism.

I agree with that, but there's an issue because many people can't distinguish between a religion's written text and the actual followers of that religion. And that's how you get comments like 


&gt;Stop defending the indefensible. Islam has for all intents and purposes become the new Nazis. When Muslim groups denounce ISIS and Muslim countries start denouncing Islamic violence against Kafir, then maybe we can say Islam isn't dead set on murdering all ""infidels"".

1903,"1) It would be naive to assume every ISIS fighter walks around with a long ass beard and long hair with a short Islamic dress. These fighters move in and out of cities, carry out various covert operations around Iraq. 

They hide in cities and commute secretly. Most ISIS fighters look like normal civilians, hence why it's difficult for army and government forces to crack down on these ISIS cells within cities. 

The ones you see on propaganda videos are incredibly different to the ones on the ground. 

2) Again it is very childish to assume that there will be mass murder of sunni civilians on such a grand scale. Most of those anti-sunni atrocities occur in small operations in remote areas without the militia leadership knowing of them. They won't happen in large scales such as this. 

As much as you wouldn't like to believe it but most of these militia leaders follow Sayed Al Al-Sistani who was very sincere in his fatwa against the in discriminant killing of anyone even ISIS members without fair trails. Sayed Al-Sistani was the man who gave the fatwa ordering Shias to: ""...not call sunnis our brothers, call them our souls instead"" 

I don't want you to think that I am denying that sunni civilian deaths occur. But they don't occur in an organised manner. A comparable situation would be the US army and Abu Ghraib prison, which undoubtably happened without the knowledge of American leadership. That's exactly the same with the Shia militias.

&gt; No rape.

You're right, the Koran never uses the word rape, it's ""your right hand possesses"", ie your sex slaves. 

verse 4-24- Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess. Thus has Allah ordained for you. All others are lawful, provided you seek them from your property, desiring chastity, not fornication. So with those among them whom you have enjoyed, give them their required due, but if you agree mutually after the requirement (has been determined), there is no sin on you. Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

23:1-6The Believers must (eventually) win throughthose who humble themselves in their prayers; who avoid vain talk; who are active in deeds of charity; who abstain from sex, except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or whom their right hands possessfor (in their case) they are free from blame. 

see also 70:22-30, 33:50 and from the hadith - ""And, forbidden to you are, wedded women, those with spouses, that you should marry them before they have left their spouses, be they Muslim free women or not; save what your right hands own, of captured [slave] girls, whom you may have sexual intercourse with, even if they should have spouses among the enemy camp, but only after they have been absolved of the possibility of pregnancy [after the completion of one menstrual cycle]; this is what God has prescribed for you.""

Beheadings: verse 8:12  When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.

&gt;No killing of innocent animals or unnecessary destruction of land.

ISIS justifies the destruction of ancient ruins and statutes because that is what Mohammed did when he destroyed all the statues in Mecca after conquering it. Not in the Koran but is in the Hadith.

&gt;No killing or war period unless that person has taken up in arms to attack you or has taken up in ARMS against you due to your religion.

There are dozens and dozens of verses dealing with that. I'm not going to post them all here.

&gt;No killing or harming of women or children.

Bukhari (52:256) - The Prophet... was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, ""They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).""  

It's perfectly ok to kill women and children if they aren't believers, from the mouth of Mohammed himself.


Also, your links saying muslims only account for 2.5% of terrorist attacks in the US leaves out the part where they make up less than 1% of the population, so they're still kind of punching above their weight.

And you're right about the ennui being problematic. People look at the changes since the 1960s and think that's Western civilization. That's not western civilization. Porn, drugs, contemporary music, et cetera did not make the west great. That's the decline of Western civilization. The rise of Western civilization was a very disciplined, purposeful society, not a helter skelter. If I didn't know any better, if I didn't know the history of the West, the protestant reformation and the enlightenment, if I thought Western only meant being high on drugs, hardcore porn, hip hop or heavy metal, et cetera, I too would've rejected the West. 

This is not a theoretical point. I've seen it here on reddit where some highly voted comment said that some western ISIS recruit who was a former rapper was the ultimate expression of the West.

Does it have to be the same word for not-marriage that the gays will have to use? Why didn't they just come up with yet another word when two people from different races wanted to get married?

Once it starts looking like the west actually has enough support to launch an invasion, Assad immediately agrees to some western demands to decrease the support.

&gt;Not true!

I doubt he thought they would pose this much of a threat in the long run, but then who in their right mind would believe that an army(Iraq) that had much larger numbers and much better equipment would run away and let ISIS pick up so many weapons and so much cash? But it all worked out since the support for western backed rebels is almost gone and everyone is joining together to help him crush the terrorist nation he helped create. Now, some people even see him as hero, battling western aggression and Islamic extremists... (If he actually realized ahead of time how well his actions that helped build ISIS would work out for him, he would be some sort of an evil super genius.)

Personally I kinda favor the Persians, but it's a regional religious civil war so, as long as they just fight each other I don't think the US etc should get involved. However when either side, as ISIS did carries out terror attacks in the West then it's fine to hurt them &amp; try to weaken them. 

Of course one has to consider if attacking them just gives them more recruits/status. I mean they can't really kill enough people through terror to in any real way weaken western democracies. I mean, 9/11 killed 3,000 people and was horrible, but even if Al Qaeda or ISIS could kill 3,000 US civilians a year, that wouldn't weaken our country given our population size and economic and military power.

2048,"Sunni Jihadists have been the largest opposition faction and beneficiaries of US and US ally support for the Syrian opposition for decades.

In the period following the Second World War, the US has engaged in covert operations and coup attempts in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries due to their support for Socialism and Russia (just as in South and Central America, Africa, and South East Asia):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Syria

This means that the primary choice of opposition was radical Sunni Islamists due to their rejection and violent opposition to the inherent secularism of socialist leaning governments:

http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-s-uprising-in.../29221

This has lead to decades of violence and conflict between the Syrian government and the Sunni radicals, and terrorist attacks against Syrian Christian and Alawites. The Sunnis due to their lack of political dominance in the country have instead resorted to terrorist attacks against civilians and government officials in order to oppose the secularism of the Syrian government, the government forced into a position to protect Syrian civilians has lead to increasing violence between the two factions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Syria

Syria's current uprising is not secular or based on the desire for democratic reform. The majority of the Syrian protesters and rebels have always been dominated by radical Sunnis who have wanted a government based on Sharia.

Syrias uprising is not a secular one. Most participants are devout Muslims inspired by Islam. By virtue of Syrias demography most of the opposition is Sunni Muslim and often come from conservative areas.

http://foreignpolicy.com/.../islamism-and-the-syrian.../

Iraqi politicians stated numerous times that if the US backed the Syrian rebels it would destabilize Iraq, which as they called, happen exactly as they said it would.

The idea that secularists and moderates ever had a chance to be the dominate rebel military opposition in Syria is a nonsensical fantasy. -Patrick Cockburn

Additionally, a western diplomat makes the startling revelation that the vast majority of Syrian rebels are Islamist thugs:

""The official was his governments main conduit to the Syrian rebels. I asked him what percentage of the rebels western countries could support: what percentage were not jihadis, not committing human rights abuses, looting or kidnapping  and were militarily effective?""

[""There was a silence. Finally, he said: Thirty per cent. It was a devastating admission. Then he paused and said he had been considering only the first three criteria.

Even Elizabeth O'Bagy who works for John McCain as one the most widely cited analysts on Syria has stated there are no secular rebels. So why then is the US backing and want to intervene on the behalf of violent Islamists who are slaughtering thousands of innocent Syrians?

We already know from wikileaks that the US was funding Syrian opposition groups in order to destabilize Syria prior to the uprising:

ISIS gives the West an easy target to fight against. Using conventional warfare to fight terrorist cells across the world is hard. Using conventional warfare to fight ISIS is much more straight forward.

Other pros 
1. They are easily demonizable so politicians (and citizens) can get behind the fight against them in ways that are much easier than say - invading Iraq and ousting Saddam.
2. They prolong the civil war in Syria - which makes life hard on Assad and increases the chances of a government change there at some point. (Obviously, the main reason why Turkey and SA are helping to fund them).
3. Other than Syria, they are mostly contained in Iraq which the West can use as leverage to maintain influence there by helping to liberate areas.
3. They are ""uniting"" most of the middle east Western allies against them. Aside from obviously Turkey and SA. But its not like Turkey and SA care about how successful ISIS is, as long as it keeps Syria off balance and allows them to increase their influence in the area.

No, I'm taking your example where you claim, and I quote ""when somebody does something like strap a bomb to their chest and blow up a market full of innocent people, there's absolutely no reason to think they would ever do anything like that if they didn't believe they would be rewarded for it in the afterlife.."" and showing why it's absolutely ignorant and wrong.

Again, totally wrong - if you're going to pretend their being atheist doesn't matter, and their motivations were based on unrelated ideological concerns (whatever those might be), you have to admit the same thing for every other group as well.

&gt;I literally just showed you the history of the practice, which originated with marxist groups, not anyone religious. Are you incapable of reading things in front of your face?

You literally showed me no such thing. Nothing of the sort appears in your posts. 

Even if it did, the motivations of the group it originated with don't necessarily have any relation whatsoever to the motivations of the groups that use it now, just as the motivation to use a plane as a bomber has no relation to the original intent to use planes for transportation.

&gt;So when people who belong to the group you claim membership in do something, they're ""wackos"" and not representative

If someone of your race, or your gender, or your nationality killed people for no reason, would it say something about that race, gender, or nationality? Or would you think that maybe there was something wrong with that person and that it didn't reflect on you at all?

&gt;but when wackos from another group make a claim, suddenly they have the authority to represent billions of people who disagree with them and hate everything they represent.

ISIS doesn't claim to represent anyone but ISIS. Whether you think they represent Islam or not is up to you, but you have just as much authority as they or anyone else to say whether they represent Islam.

2120,"&gt;And the fact that multiple people make that claim and nobody standing outside can actually say ISIS is right means that by definition, they must be wrong.

Why must they be wrong? Maybe they're the only ones who are right. They have literally as much right to claim to represent Islam as anyone else who practices Islam. In fact, they might have even *more* of a right to claim that title since they take the Koran literally instead of interpreting it to make it fit in better with modern society. In a very real sense, the version if Islam practiced by ISIS is the most pure, true form of Islam

&gt;You've repeatedly made the claim that eliminating religion is an improvement, putting ""lack of religion"" ahead of ""presence of religion"" - you can pretend that's not making a claim about the preferability of a lack of religion, but you're only fooling yourself.

You said that I claimed everything about atheism is good, which is not what I said and is not what I believe. Atheism has it's drawbacks, they just don't outweigh its advantages.

&gt;Actually, no, that isn't how religions automatically think. Some members of some religions might think that, same as some atheists take on an ""us vs them"" attitude, and neither one is the slightest bit superior to the other.

All current major world religions have a text which requires adherents to hold certain beliefs. A person can choose not to believe those things, but then they're not truly adherents of that religion. Atheists have no such requirement since, again, it's just a lack of belief.

Don't take my world for it this is a science piece that was not done by Americans explaining why. 

No its not our fault.

You attacked our city, killed thousands of not just Americans but men, women and children from all over the world, then tell us you will do it again and again and there's nothing we can do about it because you'll never find us. Trying to will only get civilians killed and make you look bad. Well what do they say now? Oh that's right most the leadership that was talking then are dead. 

Is it fucked up places like Iraq and Afghanistan have to rebuild their countries, sure. However, like I said with Nazi Germany, they let this happen by not keeping there own mental ill and evil ideologies in check. In fact quite the opposite they funded, trained, armed, mobilized, and then hid them. Is this the innocent people's fault no not  a lot of them at least not directly, but it was the leaderships fault. So what you are asking Americans to do is stay out of these countries, however that would require we let our enemies grow and mature in ways that would allow them to threaten us. Again sorry you might be brain washed to allow such things to happen among you or even hoping that they succeed. However we are free, free to think for ourselves, and free to defend ourselves. What don't you understand, no terrorist cell that threatens America will survive. If those cells are hiding among you (and you know if they are, grown men know what's going on around them and their homes) then guess what maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually the Americans will come and they will destroy them. Either kick them out of your community, leave or die with them. However don't blame us because they exist among you. 

How thick can you be to think the defense of ""we surrounded ourselves with civilians now you can't touch us"" would actually work? Hey that sucks for the civilians, which are actually hostages, but that doesn't mean we can just let them continue. So is it their fault for living there? You keep making this same argument. Yes, its there fault for living there AND allowing Islamic radicalism to spread and grow to the point of threating other sovereign nations. This isn't the Quran you don't have the blessing of almighty God to destroy ""the great evil"" that is America. Jihad is just cold blooded murder, period. Terrorism is cold blooded murder, period. If you can not only practice your religion peacefully, BUT stop your own countrymen from killing innocent people that don't want anything to do with your religion then yes it is your fault.

What makes you think that we would let blowing up our towers and bombing peaceful sporting events , bombing subways and killing cartoonist in France, or the terror attacks on Great Brittan just slide with no repercussions? The terrorist are not even this gullible so why are the middle eastern people?

That statement is the most racist statement you have seen in a long time?

How is the truth of sharia law racist? This is the ugly truth were all people are not treated equally, where all this paid for education and free medical care you speak of is bullshit. This is were innocent people or people with misdemeanor offences are murdered publicly for the ohhs and ahhhs of the blood crazed fanatics of a diabolical religion which rule. If you are proud of that and me calling it evil and stone aged offends you, good. Call me a racist all you want but Islamic is not a race. It is the biggest problem in the world today and not just America, but the whole world is tired of dealing with your bullshit. How the fuck can you sleep at night defending such actions?

So your morale comparison is Saddam Hussein, I thought a country lie the US or France had a higher morale ground based on hundreds of year of laws.

Wait so first I was racist for calling these men's actions evil, yet now we are a piece of shit because ""our morale comparison"" is people like Hussein and Gadhafi (the man with the plan for peace love, education and free medical care for all.....)? Well which is it? 

See that's the problem you think you can have it both ways, be the lion that kills the forces of ""evil"" and the poor helpless starving innocent people that just want America to stop bombing their orphanages. You can not have it both ways. You want Americans out then tell your leadership to stop fucking with us or get a gun and join them in trying to force us out. Those are your options.

Your people are a joke your social system is a joke, your laws are a joke, your religion is a joke, your military and governments are jokes and the best thing that happen for you countries in the last 50 years is American flags flying over your skies. 

Now after all the unfortunate but yet necessary blood has been spilt these places are finally starting to come back together in diplomatic fashion were people can vote for their leadership with a voice. Are all these places running a smooth diplomatic system, no because corruption is everywhere. However, it's ingrained in your society were peaceful exchanges of power are very very far and in between. We gave you a chance for a better existence and to join the modern world, what you do with it is up to you. Now should terrorist cells like the new ISIS starting making camp in your back yard again then guess who's coming....agian? DONT LET IT HAPPEN! Why is that so complicated for you?

Edit: Most of these countries were on the brink of civil war or already deep in the midst of it. Hussein was tried by a court of his own peers and countrymen and hung by the neck by his own people. Gadhafi was drug through the streets and fucked with a knife in his ass until he died, again by his own people. Now why would their own people do such a thing to these great Islamic leaders?

Fuck it I feel like going further. Lets talk Syria and Bashar al-Assad. This was yet another nation already in the midst of civil war which terrorist cells know is a land of milk and honey for them, where they can grow in number and slowly yet surely increase in supplies and armaments. The rebels are taking cities, the governments forces can hardly hold their ground with many defecting daily. These groups know they can pull at your religious strings because unlike them you fear God. Then as they grow in number and spirit they move out to claim portions of a fucking sovereign nation, while at civil war still a sovereign nation, like buzzards coming for road kill. Then the government in a dire attempt to gain some fear commit chemical warfare on its own people. See that's where they (Syrian government) fucked up, we were watching it and coordinating to try and keep these terror cells from literally conquering Syria village by village. So now you fucked up and broke not only a UN law but the international court on war crimes law as well. Like what the fuck do the think happens next? If it didn't then things like the USA, UN, and IWC court are fucking fake and well they are not. We mean it when we say sovereign countries or not you can't mass murder women and children. Period.

India is not stupid they themselves know Islamic state has very little base in Pakistan and cannot survive under Pashtun tribal culture. You either assimilate into the Pashtun culture if you are arab you go back home.

The way ISIS operates will not work in the tribal belt. They have to change their tactics but they also need a base of operations that as we currently speak is being constantly bombarded by the Pakistan military. Their also need a support base before that and the only signs they have shown of this is allegiances with smaller taliban factions. They have little to no presence outside of this in the region.

The type of radical Islam ISIS uses doesn't work in Pakistan / Afghanistan or the sub - continent.

Yes the religion is Islam... but not all Islamic countries are the same because culture and tradition plays a huge role and affects religion as well. Sub - continent culture is very very different from Middle - Eastern / Arabic culture. The way people think and behave is different.

ISIS would first need to establish a presence in the region before they even think about trying to gain access to nuclear weapons.

How many deaths have happened in Iraq since our invasion? Has the number hit 2 million people yet? Would Saddam have killed near as many? Would ISIS have had any shot of going into Iraq if Saddam was still in power? Would the U.S. lost as much global goodwill if we had stayed out of it?

Sure, it's impossible to build another bunker. Our stupid congresscritters now want another 10k troops on the ground. How do you know they don't need to visit the area where that bunker was? I'm actually amazed at how stupid that 10k troop idea is. We had 100k+ troops there and there were tons of deaths from the infighting. But somehow 10k troops today will make a difference.

2231,"I think you're specifically referring to ISIS creating a corrupted version of Islam, but in case this is an asinine attempt to wave away every religion on planet earth as ""made up shit you can have any way you want"" I have to take issue. Not because I'm religious, but because if you oversimplify religion you're working with a completely useless and harmful (to yourself, honestly) framework to view religious people and the world in general.

The vast majority of religious institutions do not let you ""have it any way you want"" . They are actually pretty damn stringent about their belief systems. Why do you think Shia and Sunnis have been fighting for hundreds of years? It's not because each side can ""have it any way they want"". On the contrary, they CAN'T have it any way but theirs.

And even the moderate Christians in the USA have a belief system that ultimately falls back on the bible and the teachings of Jesus. You can try to say ""it's made up and they just interpret it how they want"" but you may as well be saying that about the constitution of the United states. IF you honestly believe that western Christians would happily change their belief systems to include violent suicide then you are pretty out of touch with religious folks in this country.

I don't think religion is ""made up shit"" and I don't think the reason ISIS is so willing to commit these horrible atrocities has to do with them ""making up shit"" either. Sadly, they are actually acting on an extremely stringent religious system that comes directly from the quran and has been around for thousands of years in different forms - most recenty Wahabist islam.
