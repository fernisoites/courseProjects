/* Your task is that add code to the program below so that the print
 * statements at the end of main print addresses that are in the 
 * correct range. In other words the first line will print an address
 * that really is a global data address. If you are adding more than 
 * about 5 lines of code, you should rethink your approach or ask for help.
 * (Adding constant address values will not get any marks even if correct.)
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Do not change the printf statements except to add the appropriate
 * arguments.
 * 
 * - This file will not compile until the printf statements are fixed.
 *
 * - Your code will be run on a 64-bit CDF machine to test it.
