Paper Title:
Insertion Policy Selection Using Decision Tree Analysis


Paper abstract:
Our submission is a simple storage efficient insertion policy over the
default LRU replacement policy that requires minimal hardware change.
It uses the fact that last level cache has filtered temporal locality. Many
of the lines brought to cache are never accessed again. Even if they are
accessed they do not experience bursts, but rather they are reused when
they are near the near LRU position in the LRU stack. We use decision tree
analysis of multi-set-dueling to choose the optimal insertion position
of the LRU stack. Inserting in this position, zero reuse distance lines
minimize their dead time while the non-zero lines remain in the cache long
enough to be reused and avoid a miss. Our multi set dueling technique is
scalable. It does not use one leader set for each competing policy. Instead
leader sets can adaptively choose the policy it uses depending on the
decision taken in the previous level of decision tree. For a 1MB 16
way set-associative last level cache in a single core processor, our entry
uses only 2069 bits over the LRU replacement policy.
