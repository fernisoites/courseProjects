Title:
Dead Block Replacement and Bypass with a Sampling Predictor

Abstract:
We present a cache replacement and bypass policy driven by dead block
prediction.  A block is considered dead is it will be replaced before it
will be used again.  If dead blocks can be identified, then they can be
replaced early.  If a block is predicted to be "dead on arrival," i.e.,
it will not be accessed again after it is placed in the cache, then it
can bypass the cache.  The predictor is based on one simple observation:
if a block becomes dead after being touched by a particular instruction,
then other blocks touched by that instruction are also likely to become dead.

Ideally, we would track the tendency of blocks to become dead for every
instruction accessing the cache.  However, to fit within a realistic
hardware budget, we sample only a few sets from the cache.  This paper
describes our sampling dead block predictor and the techniques used to make
it fit within the allow hardware budget for the cache replacement contest.
