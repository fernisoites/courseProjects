*** 2. Paper Abstract (267 words) ***
In this paper, we propose a map-based adaptive insertion
policy (MAIP). On a cache miss, MAIP predicts a
reuse possibility of an incoming cache line from run-time
information. When the predicted reuse possibility is lower
than the threshold level, MAIP does not insert the incoming
cache line into the MRU position. It helps early eviction of
useless cache lines and improves cache efficiency.

To predict reuse possibility correctly, MAIP tracks
memory access history. MAIP employs bitmap-like data
structure, which we call memory access map, for tracking
memory access history. The feature of memory access map is
cost-efficiency. The memory access map with a 7.7 KB budget
can cover up to 3 MB memory area. To detect previously
accessed location, MAIP uses a memory access map as an
additional cache tag because it holds all memory accesses of
the corresponding zone.

Based on both an original cache tag and the memory
access map, MAIP predicts reuse possibility of the incoming
line in two metrics that are (1) spatial locality and (2)
temporal locality. (1) Spatial locality is derived from the
reuse possibility of neighbors of the memory address of the
incoming cache line. (2) Temporal locality is derived from
the reuse possibility from the memory access instruction
that initiates corresponding cache miss. Combination of
these predictions improves accuracy of the reuse possibility
prediction because each locality supports different memory
access patterns.

We evaluated MAIP by simulation study. The simulation
result shows that MAIP reduces cache miss count by
8.3% from LRU. MAIP improves performance by 2.1% in
single-core and by 9.1% in multi-core compared with the
traditional LRU policy.
