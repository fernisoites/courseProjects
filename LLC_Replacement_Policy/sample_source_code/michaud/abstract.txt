Abstract:
We introduce the 3P replacement policy for a last-level private cache
and the 4P policy for a last-level shared cache.  Both policies are
based on the CLOCK policy and are incrementally derived from DIP.
In particular, we use set sampling and bimodal insertion with two
different values for bimodal throttling.  We show how bimodal insertion
can be emulated under the CLOCK policy. Policies 3P and 4P combine
respectively 3 and 4 different insertion policies: they use a new
multi-policy selection mechanism that allows combining more than two
different policies. Policies 3P and 4P also use a novel bimodal
insertion implementation that improves memory-level parallelism. 
Policy 4P is thread-aware and uses a simple method for fairer sharing 
of a cache by multiple programs.
