Title
"SCORE: A Score-Based Memory Cache Replacement Policy"

Abstract
We propose SCORE, a novel adaptive cache replacement policy, which uses a score
system to select a cache line to replace. Results show that SCORE offers low
overall miss rates on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, and provides an average IPC that
is 4.9% higher than LRU and 7.4% higher than LIP.
