Abstract

Cache plays an important role in the process of designing microprocessor.
In this paper, we propose an adaptive sub-set based replace policy (ASRP)
for effective cache management. In ASRP policy, we divide each last-level
cache (LLC) set into several subsets, and one subset is active and others
are inactive at a given time. The victim block is only chosen from the
active subset. A counter is used to record the cache misses during a
period of time. When the number is greater than a predefined threshold,
the active subset is changed to the neighbor one. To adapt the program
behavior changing, a dynamic policy is used to choose different thresholds
according to which one has least misses in the sample sets. Using the
given framework in this championship our ASRP policy improves LRU by 4.5%
on geometric average for 28 SPEC CPU 2006 programs and some programs gains
an improvement up to 52.78%.
